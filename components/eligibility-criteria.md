Criterion  | Inclusion | Exclusion | Justification
-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------
Population | Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT | other kinds of networks, such as those using mobile phones | IoT devices have resource constraints, but are dedicated to the task, while mobile phones are less constrained and more capable devices, able to access information using the internet or with the help of the user. The concern with routing algorithms is primarily with the constraints of IoT devices.
Context    | IoT, autonomous robots and similar industrial applications | Emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure | The excluded scenarios can take advantage of satellite links, which are easier to manage than a full mesh network. By contrast, IoT devices are often installed in embedded, low-power applications, which means they cannot use a satellite connection.
Concept    | Routing protocols, dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance | Techniques for improving throughput, such as multipath routing | For this study, we are concerned with reliability for applications which deal with small amounts of data. Performance improvements can be added later.
