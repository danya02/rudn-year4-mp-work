For this scoping review, the Population is Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT. The Context is IoT, autonomous robots and similar industrial applications. The Concept is Routing protocols, dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance. Does the following abstract match these topics?

Optical transmission systems provide high capacity, low latency and jitter, and high reliability for city-scale networks. Recirculating loop experiments have facilitated the study of signal propagation in long-haul optical transmission systems. However, they are unsuited for developing control and management software for city-scale optical networks with dozens or hundreds of reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer (ROADM) units, diverse interconnection topologies, and dynamic traffic patterns. Large-scale testbeds can help, but may be inflexible and time- or cost-prohibitive. Reconfigurable testbeds such as COSMOS enable piece-wise emulation of a city-scale network by applying space and wavelength switching, dual-use software-defined networking (SDN) controllers, and comb sources, while digital twin models enable software emulation. Results from the development of a digital twin for COSMOS are presented for optical amplifiers and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) including both analytical and machine learning (ML) models.
