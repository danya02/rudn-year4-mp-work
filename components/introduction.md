Wireless ad-hoc mesh networks (MANETs) are a significant area of development in IoT devices.
They are being deployed in a wide range of applications, from healthcare to automotive to industrial,
where permanent infrastructure can be difficult to deploy.

Mesh networks consist of a number of nodes which connect to each other opportunistically and route data between each other
based on a changing topology: this is done using a routing algorithm.

As of 2024, there do not appear to be any scoping reviews on the topic of routing algorithms for IoT wireless mesh networks.
This review will provide a summary of the current research in the area, focusing on resource-constrained devices and applications.
Our hypothesis is that in order to achieve a good balance of quality of service and energy efficiency,
routing algorithms must be specialized for the IoT wireless mesh application,
rather than using generic internet protocols.
