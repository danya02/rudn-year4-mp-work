# Protocol
## Design

The review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). There will be five stages in the review process: 
1. Identifying the research questions; 
2. Identifying relevant studies; 
3. Study selection;
4. Data extraction/charting the data;
5. Collating, summarizing, and reporting results.

### Stage 1: Identifying the Research Questions

A preliminary search of relevant literature was undertaken in one database (searching ScienceDirect) using the following queries:
`mesh network AND routing`, `wifi AND routing AND mesh`, `wireless AND mesh network`.

These findings (e.g., [...]) were used to inform the background for the review, refine its scope, generate eligibility criteria, and develop the search strategy.

The following objectives and research questions were identified:
- Objective 1: Conceptualization
  - How are routing algorithms defined and conceptualized in the context of IoT networks?
  - What applications have been developed or studied?
  - What are the challenges in the design of IoT wireless mesh networks?
- Objective 2: Operationalization
  - What algorithms and protocols are commonly used?
  - What metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms?
  - How are domain-specific challenges addressed in IoT (e.g., battery life, computational constraints)?
- Objective 3: Evaluation
  - How are the results of routing protocols evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency?
  - What methodologies are used to validate and compare the algorithms?
  - What is the success criterion for IoT wireless applications?

hrough seeking to answer the above questions, we aim to identify gaps in the literature (Objective 4), which need to be addressed as part of future research on wireless mesh network routing.

### Stage 2: Identifying Relevant Studies
The "PCC" mnemonic (population, concept, and context) is recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute to construct clear inclusion criteria for scoping review and identify the focus and context of the review (Table 1).

#### Population

All participants involved in the development and application of artificial intelligence methods for gene classification will be considered. This includes researchers, bioinformaticians, and data scientists working on genomics or related fields. Additionally, experts from adjacent disciplines, such as computational biology or medical genetics, who contribute to the development of machine learning and AI techniques for gene classification, may also be included.

#### Concept
In defining the concept for this review, several decisions were made to focus the scope (Table 1). Studies that apply [...] will be included.

To address Objective 1 (Conceptualization), we will consider primary studies, commentaries, and editorials that discuss theoretical frameworks, methods, and challenges in the design of IoT wireless mesh networks.

For Objectives 2 (Operationalization) and 3 (Evaluation), the review will focus on primary studies that involve the development of IoT devices and networks. These studies must involve a focus on routing or network maintenance. While the scope of these studies may vary between routing algorithms in specific or wireless networks in general, the core requirement is that they address the question of routing.

Studies will only be included if they:
 1. Provide sufficient detail about the AI methodology, such as the model architecture, data preprocessing, and implementation techniques.
 2. Clearly define the objectives and methods, including how the AI algorithm was trained and evaluated.

If studies do not have a focus on routing, or apply to a different type of network, they will be excluded. Additionally, if a study lacks sufficient methodological detail to assess its relevance to the research objectives, it will be reviewed with caution, and the ambiguity will be documented.

#### Context
Studies that [...] will be included. This encompasses research globally, addressing diverse challenges such as [...]. The scope includes studies that analyze [...].

Eligible studies include both qualitative and quantitative research, as well as commentaries and editorials discussing the [...]. Grey literature, such as technical reports or guidelines from research institutions, will also be included if they contribute to the conceptual or operational understanding of [...] in this domain.

Exclusion criteria include conference abstracts, non-peer-reviewed articles, and studies outside the [...]. Only articles published in English between 2018 and 2024 will be reviewed, ensuring a focus on recent advancements in the field.

### Search Strategy
The search strategy will follow a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant literature. Databases such as ScienceDirect will be searched using keywords like "wireless", "mesh network", "MANET", along with their synonyms. Boolean operators and advanced search techniques will be employed to refine results. Reference lists of key articles will also be reviewed, and, if necessary, authors of primary studies will be contacted for additional data or clarification.

In addition, grey literature sources like Google Scholar will be conducted. All retrieved articles will be managed using reference tools such as Zotero, with duplicates removed for streamlined screening and analysis. This method ensures the inclusion of high-quality studies addressing the application of [...].

#### Searching Other Resources
Manual searches of journals such as [...] will be conducted using targeted keywords. Grey literature, including institutional reports and working papers, will be identified through Google Scholar by screening titles and abstracts of the first 100 results.

Seminal reviews, commentaries, and influential articles will also be included to expand the dataset. For instance, studies analyzing the [...] will be prioritized.

### Stage 3: Study Selection
The review process will be carried out by the reviewer in two stages. Titles and abstracts will be considered first; at this stage, some articles will be screened out. Depending on the results of the first stage of the review, AI methods may be employed to help screen the articles.
Articles that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the full-text review. If, based on the results of the first stage of the review, it is unclear whether to include the article, it will be included in the full-text review. The final search results will be presented in the PRISMA flowchart from PRISMA-ScR.

### Stage 4: Charting the Data
Data will be extracted into a spreadsheet program following guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Each member will extract data for a proportion of articles.

The data that will be extracted, will include the characteristics of the studies relevant to our research questions. The information to be extracted (Table 2) is consistent with the objectives of the analysis and is intended to reflect key findings relevant to the issue(s) under consideration.
