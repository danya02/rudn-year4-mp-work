One of the key technological challenges hampering the use of multi-hop mesh networks is the extremely high communication overhead of route discovery and maintenance algorithms. The problem is especially pronounced under dynamic network conditions caused by user mobility and nodes joining and leaving the network. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed algorithm for constructing a virtual coordinate system used for geo-like routing by approximating the physical network nodes coordinate. The proposed algorithm, called gradient assisted routing (GAR), builds upon two-hop neighbors\u2019 information exchanged in beacons in contrast to conventional geographic routing protocols which rely on external positioning information. We evaluate the proposed solution using algorithmic, topological, and routing-related metrics of interest. We further numerically quantify how the node mobility increases the time needed for topology stabilization, and how network size affects the route discovery success rate. Our comparison also shows that for small to mid-size mesh networks (up to 60 nodes), the performance of the proposed routing procedure is similar to the conventional geographic routing protocols that exploit external positioning information. The proposed solution may efficiently supplement the traditional on-demand routing in small to mid-size mesh systems by independently establishing 50 to 70% of paths and thereby reducing the discovery overheads."}]}]}]}}}

A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes\u2019 preferred parents.

FANETs research is being driven by the potential for UAVs to be utilized in these regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most important FANET characteristics, mobility models, applications, and routing protocols. The present paper is an effort to provide a comprehensive description of the various routing techniques utilized by the most prevalent routing protocols in FANETs, including topology-based, position- based, hierarchical, swarm-based, and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. Reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning are both encompassed in a newly anticipated classification. In the meanwhile, this study primarily centres around the taxonomy for learning agents (single- agent, multi-agent) and learning models (model-based and free-model). In addition, the paper intends to shed light on identifying the applications of FANETs in various categories and identify research gaps and future opportunities in this field. In addition, it compares the results qualitatively to those of the previous surveys. Any future work on the FANET routing protocol could benefit from this paper as a reference and roadmap."}]}]}]}}}

To tackle this issue, the optimization of selecting a content-cached satellite and routing is jointly performed, using the example of Earth observation data cached across multiple satellites. In this paper, we first formulate a dynamic power minimization problem constrained by the queue stability of all LEO satellites, where the control variables are the selection of content-cached satellite and routing in every satellite. To solve this long-term time-averaged problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization framework to transform the original problem into a series of slot-by-slot problems. Moreover, we prove that the average power consumption and the average queue backlog by the proposed algorithm can be upper-bounded via theoretical analysis.

Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL\u2019s delays by between 33.51% and 39.84%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16% and 2.03% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL\u2019s memory requirements. SMOR\u2019s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55% and 2.74% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks."}]}]}]}}}

However, network congestion caused by overlapping routers poses challenges in WMN optimization. To address these issues, researchers have explored metaheuristic algorithms to strike a balance between coverage and connectivity in WMNs. This study introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, namely Transient Trigonometric Harris Hawks Optimizer (TTHHO), specifically designed to tackle the optimization problems in WMNs. The primary objective of TTHHO is to find an optimal placement of routers that maximizes network coverage and ensures full connectivity among mesh routers. Notably, TTHHO's unique advantage lies in its efficient utilization of residual energy, strategically placing the sink node in areas with higher energy levels. The effectiveness of TTHHO is demonstrated through a comprehensive comparison with seven well-known algorithms, including Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Transient Search Optimizer (TSO). The proposed algorithm is rigorously validated using 33 benchmark functions, and statistical analyses and simulation results confirm its superiority over other algorithms in terms of network connectivity, coverage, congestion reduction, and convergence.

However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed. This protocol has minimal effect on the original communication dynamics and can effectively deal with Packet drop, wormhole, Session hijacking, and other main attacks in MANETs.

Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09% to 68.13%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23% to 29.12%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33% to 82.38% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience."}]}]}]}}}

The behavior of the MANET is analyzed for Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) that maintenances communication among 150 nodes for NCS. The simulation is carried out in Network Simulator (NS2) software with different nodes cluster to estimate the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and control overhead. The benefit of MANET is that it has a fixed topology, which permits flexibility since mobile devices may be used to construct ad-hoc networks anywhere, scalability because more nodes can be added to the network, and minimal operating expenses in that no original infrastructure needs to be developed. AODV routing is a flat routing system that does not require central routing nodes. As the network grows in size, the network can be scaled to meet the network design and configuration requirements.

This paper aims to push further the analysis of the operation and benefits of such networks by proposing a novel optimization model tailored for power router grids based on the most recent literature for the convexification of optimal power flows. Moreover, it demonstrated that radial-based models can be expanded for grids meshed through power routers.

To obtain the maximum throughput in a WMN, an efficient routing and channel assignment is required. But there are certain constraints in the WMN such as end-to-end delay, interference, and available bandwidth which limits the QoS aware service availability to the end users. Moreover, predicting traffic demand is challenging due to the varying needs of the users which further limits the throughput. Hence, to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a utility-based multicast routing and channel assignment (UBMR-CA) scheme. The two main objectives of the proposed scheme are the loop free routing and minimization of the total utility from a source to a destination at any time. The problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem along with the constraints. The utility for a link is calculated using a utility weight metric (UWM) which is used for sending multicast messages from a source to destinations. Once the utility for all the links is calculated, these links are assigned to a particular channel keeping in view of various constraints such as capacity, bandwidth, and interference between different links. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using extensive simulation with respect to various parameters such as aggregate throughput, fairness, delay, packet loss and collision probabilities, and total execution time.

Although wireless mesh network technology can facilitate these smart functionalities, it is important to address the vulnerabilities and cyber-attack risks that are inherent to it. Smart Grid's reliance on the Internet amplifies security concerns. A number of methods have been proposed to address this issue; while some have made promises, they all need substantial amounts of computational resources. With this technology, channels based on trust can be set up. The security of the system is built utilizing a family relationship-based method, which makes use of measures that may be used to gauge a node's originality. Additionally, the power consumption and signal strength of the node are taken into account. The complexity and extent of the network need the development of new types of smart grid communication. Finding a way to detect and thwart major assaults on routing protocols is another design challenge. Smart grids rely on these protocols in its data system for efficient interchange of renewable energy. A unique secure energy routing mechanism is developed in this proposed model for secure data communication. In the proposed model, a new method for Neighbor Nodes Trust Tagging Model for Optimized Route Detection (NNTT-ORD) is proposed for establishing secure route for data communication in smart grids. The proposed model is compared with the existing model and the results represent that the proposed model route provides a secure environment for data transmission."}]}]}]}}}

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on the particular issues that arise from implementing routing in sensor networks as opposed to the more conventional data routing in wireless connections. Due to the importance of energy conservation in the design of WSNs, numerous protocols for routing, power management, and data transmission have been developed for these networks. When it comes to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring, etc., routing in WSNs is crucial. The primary objective of this study is to analyse routing issues and to analyse routing-related optimization issues. Features pertaining to routing issues like energy consumption, security, speed, and dependability are explored later. Attention has been paid to the routing protocols, which might vary by use case and network design. In this study, a comprehensive review is performed on the cutting-edge approaches to routing in WSNs. A brief introduction to WSNs and a discussion of the obstacles that routing protocols must overcome throughout their creation before moving on to a thorough examination of the various routing approaches now in use is considered. The comparative analysis is performed different routing techniques like Energy-Aware Routing for Software-Defined Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks (EAR-SDMWSN), DORA: A Destination-Oriented Routing Algorithm for Energy-Balanced Wireless Sensor Networks (DORA) and Energy Proficient Load Balancing Routing Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks (EP-LBR).

Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we analyze the varying efficacy of these models in different scenarios.

In contrast, Ensemble of Bagged Decision Trees emerge as the optimal model for the Barcelona scenario, exhibiting strong performance in selecting the most suitable forwarding node for packet transmission. However, the transferability of these models to scenarios where they were not trained is notably limited, as evidenced by their decreased performance on datasets from other scenarios. This observation underscores the importance of considering the data characteristics when selecting ML models for real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify that the distribution of nodes within datasets significantly influences model performance, highlighting its critical role in determining model efficacy.

SDN's ability to provide centralized network management through a programmable controller, separate from data forwarding elements, has led researchers to incorporate SDN features with IoT (SDIoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSN) ecosystems. However, despite the SDN support, these networks encounter challenges related to load-imbalance routing issues, as the SDN controller may be constrained while certain access points serving end users become overloaded. In response to these challenges, various load-balancing routing solutions have been proposed, each with distinct objectives. However, a comprehensive study that classifies and analyzes these solutions based on their weaknesses and postmortem challenges is currently lacking. This paper fills this gap by providing an in-depth classification of existing solutions. The study categorizes the problems addressed by different schemes and summarizes their findings.

This encompasses wireless communication, cyber\u2013physical systems (CPS), machine-to-gateway communication (M2G), wireless power transmission (WPT), and IoT infrastructure and protocols such as IPv6, 6LoWPAN, MQTT, CoAP. Furthermore, the study explores routing algorithms within the IoT network context, recognizing their crucial role in addressing challenges related to sensor battery lifespan and energy conservation. Challenges in energy resource management, which include considerations of sensor types, spatial relationships, and connection stability, are also discussed. The study investigates the energy consumption of different types of connections in an IoT network during data transfer, considering factors such as jitter, packet loss, overhead, congestion, distance between nodes, network protocol (MQTT), and data size (32MB). Two scenarios are explored: one where the minimum frequency band and data rate are fixed, revealing that Sigfox consumes more energy than others, while Bluetooth v5.0 is more energy-efficient; and another where the maximum frequency band and data size are fixed, showing that 5G consumes more energy, whereas NB-IoT is more energy-efficient. Finally, the research investigates the energy consumption increments for various network connections (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, Bluetooth V5.0, Sigfox, WiMAX, LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and NB-IoT) as the frequency band and network data rate increase from minimum to maximum values, revealing increments within the range of 7% to 71%."}]}]}]}}}

These applications aim to utilize the highest amount of resources required by High Performance Computing (HPC). The interconnection network is an essential part of the HPC environment, as processes on parallel applications are constantly communicating and sharing data. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a different networking approach that separates the control plane from the data forwarding plane, which can be configured depending on the network status or specific requirements of parallel application communications. Given that the communication time significantly contributes to the overall execution time of a parallel program and considering the elapsed time during Open MPI initialization of TCP connections between processes in Ethernet networks, this paper proposes the integration of a software defined networking environment into the Open MPI library. The primary objective of our contribution is to provide the network controller with information about Open MPI processes, in order to configure the network during the initialization procedure of the Open MPI library. This may facilitate the development of SDN-based routing techniques that reduce communication times, and thus execution times, using application information, such as the Open MPI endpoints participating in a parallel program execution. To demonstrate the utility of the information provided by Open MPI processes, we have implemented a routing algorithm that will calculate the optimal paths between processes based on the weighted Dijkstra algorithm, using the number of flows traversing the topology links. The evaluation of the proposed mechanism utilizing a 2-stage fat tree topology and two parallel applications - a matrix product and the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) - showed significant improvements in execution time, with reductions of up to 2.5 times for a 4096 \u00d7 4096 matrix product and 1.3 times for an 8192 \u00d7 8192 matrix product, as well as a 1.5 times reduction for MPAS in the worst network occupancy scenario. This demonstrates the improvements in communication and therefore execution time."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e344", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e345"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e347", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e348", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e350"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e351"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e354", "view": "all"}, "_": "Software Defined Network environment integration into Open MPI library."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e356"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e359", "view": "all"}, "_": "Open MPI processes initialization time on Ethernet networks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e361"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e364", "view": "all"}, "_": "Impact of communication time in Open MPI processes."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e366"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e369", "view": "all"}, "_": "Reduction of execution time in Open MPI processes by optimizing communication time."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

Detailed computer simulation demonstrates that as the burden or load on the network growths, the efficiency of routing strategies decrease in terms of delivery probability and overhead ratio. The experiments establish that Maxprop routing delivery probability is highest than the others. It has been also observed that the ratio of packet dropped and relayed has been decreased according to buffer size increased. The First Contact routing delivery probability may not differ most with changes the buffer sizes.

The proposed scheme applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify applications and assign flow priorities based on their type. The betweenness centrality algorithm is used to identify the importance of each link in the network, and the links are ordered in the betweenness set. The proposed method monitors the load on each link and if the critically important links are overloaded, then the flow is routed in real-time to avoid congestion. The idea of MLPRS has been simulated in Mininet with an OpenDaylight controller, and the results show that it effectively improves QoS and network performance. The MLPRS approach contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing intelligent and dynamic load-balancing techniques using machine learning algorithms.

The communication requirements of many-core embedded systems are addressed by the Networks on Chip (NoC) paradigm. In this paper, a minimal and fault tolerant routing algorithm is proposed so as to route packets adaptively through the shortest path in the presence of faulty nodes. Using fault-tolerant routing algorithm to reroute packets around faulty nodes will increase latency. Besides, the performance of NoC is heavily affected by network congestion. Congestion in the network increases the time to traverse a packet from a source to a destination. The proposed routing algorithm adaptively chooses the next node where to send packet, so as to avoid packet drop in presence of congestion. The algorithm does handle both single and multiple busy nodes using reconfigurable paths (minimal and/or non-minimal)."}]}]}]}}}

To solve many pressing problems, a Compass time-space Model-based Virtual IP (CMVIP) routing scheme is proposed in this paper. In order to compensate for discontinuities in existing topology models, a compass-shaped time-space model is proposed. It can be adapted with Inter-Satellite-Link (ISL) and Ground-Satellite-Link (GSL) transmissions. A distributed algorithm with multiple optimization objectives and multiple constraints is applied for routing path discovery. To more realistically verify the specific scheme, a traffic model that supports two different services is proposed. Access and bearer services are the two main applications of an NTSN.

Wireless mesh networking technology has been pivotal in providing an affordable means to deploy a network and allow omnipresent access to users on the Internet. A multitude of emerging public services rely on the widespread, high-speed, and inexpensive connectivity provided by such networks. The absence of a centralized network infrastructure and open shared medium makes WMNs particularly susceptible to malevolent attacks, especially in multihop networks. Hence, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure privacy, security, and resilience when designing such networks. An effective method to detect possible internal and external attack vectors is to use an intrusion detection system. Although many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) were proposed for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), they can only detect intrusions in a particular layer. Because WMNs are vulnerable to multilayer security attacks, a cross-layer IDS are required to detect and respond to such attacks. In this study, we analyzed cross-layer IDS options in WMN environments. The main objective was to understand how such schemes detect security attacks at several OSI layers. The suggested IDS is verified in many scenarios, and the experimental results show its efficiency."}]}]}]}}}

As soon as two or more devices converse with one another, an ad hoc network is instantaneously created. Although placing these devices close to one another is preferred, the network's quality and speed will decline as more devices join it. The idea of a vehicular ad hoc network, an intelligent vehicular ad hoc network, and a mobile ad hoc network is also introduced in ad hoc networks since nodes travel from one point to another. Any node can join and exit this network at any time. Nodes are mobile systems or gadgets that are a part of the network, like a mobile phone, laptop, personal digital assistant, MP3 player, or personal computer. Apart from this, the paper also discusses the most important results from 2000 to 2022 from various authors. In addition, the paper contrasts mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks in terms of their uses, limitations, issues, characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of routing protocols. The most important things for ad hoc networks are that the different types of nodes (end-to-end nodes, intermediate nodes, and wireless antennas) are safe and respond quickly."}]}]}]}}}

In this research, we perform a comparative study of two widely used classes of ICN name resolution and routing schemes, namely flooding and Distributed Hash Table (DHT). We consider the flooding-based routing in Content-Centric Networks due to its wide acceptance. For the DHT scheme, we design a multi-level DHT that takes into account the underlying network topology and uses name aggregation to further reduce control overhead and improve network efficiency. Then, we compare the characteristics and performance of these two classes of name resolution and routing through extensive simulations.

Yet, compared to static wireless networks, less academic research has been done on MANETs, especially when all the nodes are in continuous movement. In particular, we consider MANETs that broadcast HELLO messages at regular time intervals in order to maintain dynamic neigh- borhood information. The range of velocities of the nodes and the HELLO message interval duration can significantly affect the performance of routing protocols in MANETs. In this work, we study the effect of varying these two main characteristics on the performance of MANETs in terms of delivered packets and packets delivery ratio that reflect routing paths stability.

A marching memory arbitrator is deployed in the path that is prone to congestion which computes the port as a buffer. The static degradation of energy power utilization in the router is solved by using a Marching memory buffer. The secure communication of data can be deployed with hash, identity, and address verification blocks.

Two types of robustness are focused in this paper. One is the topology-related network robustness, which mainly assesses the effect of attacks or faults on satellites and links. The other is the network function robustness related to routing mechanisms, which mainly assesses how resource allocation mechanisms affect network robustness. To this purpose, two satellite constellation network models based on physical network topology and traffic are proposed, along with a new satellite importance index and the robustness metrics. Based on the newly proposed satellite importance index, three different types of attacking strategies are implemented in this paper, i.e., random attacks, selective attacks based on the initial state of the network, and selective attacks based on the current state of the network. The routing methods involved in function robustness mainly include different local state routing algorithms, which we summarize into a brand-new routing model with tunable parameters. Simulation results show that the removals by the selective attacks based on the current state of the network are often more harmful than the other attack strategies. Constellation networks almost collapse for the above attack strategies as the attack ratio are nearly 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 respectively. Meanwhile, the larger constellation is more robust than the smaller one against the attacks before collapses. However, the larger constellation collapses earlier for the selective attack strategies. In addition, local-state routing algorithms with a certain level of state awareness capability can be used to improve the network function robustness."}]}]}]}}}

While numerous classic operations research solvers ensure optimal solutions, they often struggle with real-time dynamic objectives and environments, such as dynamic routing problems, which require periodic algorithmic recalibration. To deal with dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential with its capability as a self-learning and optimizing mechanism. However, the real-world applications of reinforcement learning are relatively limited due to lengthy training time and inefficiency in high-dimensional state spaces. In this study, we introduce two methods to enhance reinforcement learning for dynamic routing optimization. The first method involves transferring knowledge from classic operations research solvers to reinforcement learning during training, which accelerates exploration and reduces lengthy training time. The second method uses a state\u2013space decomposer to transform the high-dimensional state space into a low-dimensional latent space, which allows the reinforcement learning agent to learn efficiently in the latent space. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in an industrial application of an automated welding process, where our approach identifies the shortest welding pathway of an industrial robotic arm to weld a set of dynamically changing target nodes, poses and sizes. The suggested method cuts computation time by 25% to 50% compared to classic routing algorithms."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e729", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e730"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e732", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e733", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e737", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S0736584524000991/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e738", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e739"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e741", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e742", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e744"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e745"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e748", "view": "all"}, "_": "We present a novel reinforcement learning method for solving dynamic routing problems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e750"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e753", "view": "all"}, "_": "The proposed framework, namely SSD4OR-RL, suits to mixed-integer linear programming."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e755"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e758", "view": "all"}, "_": "SSD4OR-RL allows knowledge transfer between classic algorithms and RL agents."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e760"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e763", "view": "all"}, "_": "SSD4OR-RL boosts RL in high-dimensional state spaces by decomposing them."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e765"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e768", "view": "all"}, "_": "We showcase SSD4OR-RL solving ABB industrial welding robot routing challenges."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

Therefore it is necessary to minimize the overall energy consumption of mobile nodes by minimizing both transmission cost and reception cost and which results in prolonging the life time of the entire network.

Routing in such networks is an issue of upcoming concern due to the possibility of frequent link breakage as a result of node mobility and/or high rate of energy depletion of nodes. Also to fulfill certain quality parameters, presence of multiple node disjoint paths become essential. Such paths aid in the optimal traffic distribution and reliability in case of path breakages. In this paper we propose a fuzzy controlled power aware multicast routing (FPMR) protocol that takes into account estimated network evolution in terms of residual energy of nodes w.r.t. approximated energy required to complete the multicast operation, link stability, geographical positions of multicast receivers etc. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of FPMR with other state-of-the \u2013art multicast protocols. The results w.r.t. a wide range of parameters show that FPMR attains significantly high packet delivery ratio at much lesser cost than its competitors, thereby improving the lifetime of nodes."}]}]}]}}}

Fast authentication for different roaming scenarios is supported by using HMAC operations on both the mesh client side and mesh router side.

Our performance and security analysis demonstrate that LEAS is efficient and resilient to various kinds of attacks."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, we propose an energy balancing metric which explores the diversity in link qualities present at different radios. The goal is to effectively use the energy of the network and therefore extend the network lifetime. The proposed metric takes into account the transmission and reception costs for a specific radio in order to choose an energy efficient radio. In addition, the metric uses the remaining energy of nodes in order to regulate the traffic so that critical nodes are avoided. We show by simulations that our metric can improve the network lifetime up to 20%."}]}]}]}]}}}

However, MB nodes have a more complex structure than C-band nodes, impacting their cost and enhancing their induced physical layer impairments (PLIs). The main goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of several MB node architectures (namely baseline, common-band and compact MB node architectures) on the total network capacity and total network cost-per-bit, using a routing, modulation format, and spectrum assignment (RMSA) network planning tool based on a Monte\u2013Carlo simulation that also incorporates the impact of network PLIs. When the PLIs are neglected, the common-band architecture presents the lowest cost-per-bit compared to the remaining MB architectures, since only lower cost C-band components are used. However, with the PLIs impact, the common-band architecture leads to the lowest total network capacity and highest cost-per-bit due to additional noise coming from all-optical wavelength converters. In particular, the common-band total network capacity is less than half the baseline and compact total network capacities for a blocking probability of 1%, considering the best channel launch power. Also, the common-band cost-per-bit is almost twice the baseline and compact cost-per-bit due to the PLIs-induced degradation."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1214", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1215"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1217", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1218", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1220"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1221"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1224", "view": "all"}, "_": "Four multiband nodes are compared in terms of cost and capacity in a network scenario."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1226"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1229", "view": "all"}, "_": "Common-band node loses the cost advantage in presence of physical layer impairments."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1231"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1234", "view": "all"}, "_": "Common-band node capacity is less than half the baseline and compact nodes capacity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1236"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1239", "view": "all"}, "_": "Baseline and compact nodes have similar costs and capacities."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

Throughput, average energy consumption, end to end delay, work efficiency, packet delivery ratio, packet drop rate, nodes alive and routing overhead of each protocol have been demonstrated under different node density. The usefulness of some prevailing approaches towards extenuating this problem has been carried out and simulation results are used to confirm the analysis. It is observed that AODV and DSR protocol outperform TORA in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio whereas in case of Work efficiency AODV outperforms DSR and TORA protocol. AODV has a smaller amount of end to end delay and average energy consumption as equated to DSR and TORA protocols while Packet drop rate is least in TORA protocol.

Grain boundaries of similar characters form networks, whose topological invariants can be considered as distribution descriptors. Understanding the evolution of such descriptors during severe plastic deformations (SPD) can elucidate the evolution of properties and underpin the design of processing routes for target behaviour. For topological analysis of grain boundary networks, polycrystalline materials are considered here as polyhedral complexes with grain boundaries classified into two types \u2014 low-angle and high-angle. Changes of grain boundary types are calculated using sub-grain rotations, which reflects the physical mechanism of microstructure evolution during SPD. A non-physical approach, by direct conversions of low-angle to high-angle boundaries, is also explored as a reference to demonstrate the impact of the physical constraint imposed by rotations. Reported is the discovery of topological phase transitions in the grain boundary networks which might take place during severe plastic deformations of different copper alloys. Depending on the evolution approach, the transitions correspond to zeros of the Euler characteristic, or of the logarithm of the inverse connectivity, of the grain boundary network. The relations between these transitions and the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries, and between the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and plastic strain obtainable experimentally, provide new perspectives for grain boundary engineering and network design. Determining the dominant evolution mechanism and critical accumulated strain for a given material and processing route requires further experimental studies of triple junction evolution."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e534", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e535"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e537", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e538", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e542", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S1359645423006201/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

The proposed centralized rank based channel assignment scheme is based on a rank function. The rank of each node is computed based on the aggregate traffic, weighted cumulative expected transmission time (WCETT) from the gateway, and the number of NICs per node.

The disparity between bandwidth offered by a wavelength and the bandwidth requirement of a multicast connection can be purposefully solved by grooming low bandwidth connection requests into a high bandwidth wavelength channel in an optical network. In this paper, we discuss multicast traffic grooming problem using light-tree approach with static multicast connection requests. As higher layer electronic ports such as transmitters and receivers are dominant cost factors in a WDM mesh networks, it is critical to reduce their number when grooming multicast traffic into high bandwidth trees. This paper propose a heuristic algorithm called Saturated-Light-Tree based Multicast Traffic Grooming (SLTMTG) that solves grooming, routing and wavelength assignment problems. SLTMTG algorithm is based on grooming of multicast traffic to constrained light-trees in which traffic is groomed for better resource utilizations. This approach is used to minimize the grooming cost as well as wavelength requirement. Here, proposed approach tries to satisfy all connection requests. The performance of proposed algorithm has compared with existing Multicast Traffic Grooming (MTG) algorithm. The results are compared on several standard networks to measure cost and wavelength utilization."}]}]}]}}}

The optimal deployment of a UAV swarm, also known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET), to achieve on-demand coverage of mobile ground targets (MGTs) is challenging in terms of controlling UAV mobility to maximize coverage while maintaining quality of service. Data routing from UAVs to a base station (BS) without awareness of the updated topology causes link breakages, excessive retransmissions, high congestion, and energy holes. Therefore, we propose a joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol comprising three modules to perform crowd surveillance. The first JTCR module provides virtual force-based mobility control (VFMC), which controls the mobility of UAVs to track MGTs, ensuring stable bi-connectivity. The second module provides energy-efficient mobility-aware fuzzy clustering that clusters the FANET to aggregate the sensed data to each cluster head (CH) by utilizing the UAV mobility provided by the VFMC. The third module provides topology-aware Q-routing, which routes the aggregated data from CH UAVs to the BS by selecting an optimal path in terms of delay, path stability, and energy consumption. According to our performance study, the proposed JTCR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of tracking-coverage rate, connectivity rate, the number of retransmissions, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. This is mainly enabled by the realistic mobility control of the UAV swarm at the reasonable cost of control overhead."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has a lesser number of transmissions for a given CF. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high throughput, packet delivery fraction and less latency compared to other well-known algorithms in this category."}]}]}]}}}

Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market. Under these circumstances, our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode. Therefore, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming. Both mathematical techniques are applied to obtain the best solution that simultaneously minimizes the aggregate message collision time due to hidden terminals and maximizes the network lifetime.

Raghavan and Upfal (Proc. 26th Annual Symp. on Theory of Computing, 1994, pp. 133\u2013143) considered the off-line version of the problem, which was further studied in Aumann and Rabani (Proc. 6th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, 1995, pp. 567\u2013576), Kaklamanis and Persiano (Proc. 4th Annual European Symp. on Algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1136, Springer, Berlin, 1996, pp. 460\u2013470), Mihail et al. (Proc. 36th IEEE Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1995, pp. 548\u2013557), Rabani, (Proc. 37th Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1996, pp. 400\u2013409). For a line topology, the problem is the well-studied interval graph coloring problem. Ondashline algorithms for this problem have been analyzed in Kierstead and Trotter (Congr. Numer. 33 (1981) 143\u2013153). We consider trees, trees of rings, and meshes topologies, previously studied in the off-line case. We give ondashline algorithms with competitive ratio O(log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") for all these topologies. We give a matching \u03a9(log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") lower bound for meshes. We also prove that any algorithm for trees cannot have competitive ratio better than \u03a9(log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "/log log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "). We also consider the problem where every edge is associated with parallel links. While in WDM technology, a fiber link requires different wavelengths for every transmission, space division multiplexing technology allows parallel links for a single wavelength, at an additional cost. Thus, it may be beneficial in terms of network economics to combine between the two technologies (this is indeed done in practice). For "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "arbitrary"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " networks with \u03a9(log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") parallel links we give an ondashline algorithm with competitive ratio O(log "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "n"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ")."}]}]}]}]}}}

This paper proposes a multicast routing scheme in 2D torus networks. The proposed scheme is a Tree-based Algorithm which Splits torus Networks into two Equally Meshes, hence it is called TASNEM. TASNEM algorithm is a tree-based technique, in which the router simultaneously sends incoming flits on more than one outgoing channel. It requires at most two start-up times, one for each mesh subnetwork. For each mesh subnetwork, the source node delivers a message to the destination nodes along one main path and different horizontal paths branched from the main path. TASNEM algorithm can achieve high degree of parallelism and low communication latency over a wide range of traffic loads. Performance results of a simulation study on torus networks are discussed to compare TASNEM algorithm with some previous algorithms."}]}]}]}}}

This paper quantifies the reliability gain of combining classes for reliable multicast in the wireless mesh network. We define the delay as the performance metric for reliability. We then provide an analytical analysis to study the impact of group size, packet loss rate and depth of the multicast tree on the performance improvement achieved by combining classes.

Based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology, network services can be flexibly provisioned as service function chain (SFC) deployed at edge servers. In some scenarios, such as the vehicular or UAV-assisted edge computing, the network topology varies rapidly due to the mobile edge servers, which changes the routing path between adjacent VNFs in an SFC. Migrating SFC to adapt to the frequent topology change can reduce the SFC latency, and improve the quality of users\u2019 experience. However, frequent SFC migration will unavoidably increase the operation cost. In this paper, to optimize the system performance in a cost-efficient manner, we study the SFC migration problem in dynamic networks with a long-term cost budget constraint. We then propose the Topology-aware Min-latency SFC Migration (TMSM) method to strike a desirable balance between the SFC latency and the migration cost. Specifically, we first apply the Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time optimization sub-problems. Since the decomposed problem is still NP-hard, a Markov approximation based heuristic is proposed to seek a near-optimal solution for each sub-problem. Compared with the rerouting-only strategy, which does not migrate any VNF, our TMSM reduces the latency by at least 21% on average in each time slot. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better tradeoff between the SFC latency and migration cost than the baselines."}]}]}]}}}

One of the major scientific challenge in VANET implementation, is the design of routing protocol that could provide efficient and reliable node-to-node packet transmission. Routing in VANETs is a complex task in urban environment. This paper reports the overall performance evaluation of two existing routing protocols namely, Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for VANETs. This study aims at optimizing the selection of best possible routing protocol for providing reliability to data packet dissemination in an efficient way. The impact and effectiveness of existing topology based routing protocol for VANETs application has been evaluated through the use of NetSim software tool. The simulated results shows that a combination of proper channel model together with an efficient routing protocol enhance the link throughput of the VANET for a fixed network size. Further, performance evaluation also demonstrate the impact of network sizes and routing protocols on packet loss, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and overhead transmission."}]}]}]}}}

The turnaround was triggered by the release of the Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Profile which is unquestionable a great achievement but not well suited for all use cases of multi-hop networks. This paper surveys the tremendous work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks during the last 20 years. All aspects are discussed with demands for a real world Bluetooth multi-hop operation in mind. Relationships and side effects of different topics for a real world implementation are explained. This unique focus distinguishes this survey from existing ones. Furthermore, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge this is the first survey consolidating the work on Bluetooth multi-hop networks for classic Bluetooth technology as well as for Bluetooth Low Energy. Another individual characteristic of this survey is a synopsis of real world Bluetooth multi-hop network deployment efforts. In fact, there are only four reports of a successful establishment of a Bluetooth multi-hop network with more than 30 nodes and only one of them was integrated in a real world application - namely a photovoltaic power plant."}]}]}]}}}

Depending on the number of routing options that packets may use, routing algorithms are classified into two categories. If the packet can only use a single predetermined path, routing is deterministic, whereas if several paths are available, it is adaptive. It is well-known that adaptive routing usually outperforms deterministic routing. However, adaptive routers are more complex and introduces out-of-order delivery of packets. In this paper, we take up the challenge of developing a deterministic routing algorithm for direct topologies that can obtain a similar performance than adaptive routing, while providing the inherent advantages of deterministic routing such as in-order delivery of packets and implementation simplicity. The proposed deterministic routing algorithm is aware of the HoL-blocking effect, and it is designed to reduce it, which, as known, it is a key contributor to degrade interconnection network performance."}]}]}]}}}

Properly deploying this infrastructure requires that there exist models which can adequately estimate the performance of these vehicles under real scenarios. While there has been significant work on estimating energy-consumption for realistic drive profiles, there is a need to systematically incorporate the conditions (e.g. wind, elevation) along a route for enabling efficient charger deployment. In this work, we have developed a software package known as INCEPTS, an agent-based simulation software that can predict high-fidelity electric vehicle performance and can capture the dynamics exhibited by the individual vehicles as they travel on their respective routes. The software then uses this to analyze fleets of vehicles which will provide the fleet performance statistics that result from various impacts exhibited by the fleet in the simulated area. These statistics can then be further used to inform decisions such as charger deployment to ensure that the placement of chargers adapts to the local needs of the electric vehicle fleet. Furthermore, this software is developed such that it is capable of simulating different kinds of electric vehicles (e.g. cars, trucks, eVTOLs) and different locations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the software, a variety of simulations are performed using Massachusetts as a target location. The first set of simulations show the importance of accounting for local conditions of individual vehicles. For example, the difference is state-of-charge could differ by up to 30% for the same distance traveled. The second set of simulations looked at the fleet performance within Massachusetts in which a bimodality of energy used per mile is observed, with means at 184\u00a0Wh/mi and 244\u00a0Wh/mi. Our work demonstrated that this bimodality results from a combination of both local conditions and geometric restrictions caused by the road network. These results are indicative of the unique capabilities of the INCEPTS platform and we plan to demonstrate additional use-cases in follow-up studies."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"id": "alttext0010", "role": "short"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "href": "pii:S2590116821000047/fx1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "type": "simple", "id": "aep-link-id9"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0020", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Coupling of environmental factors with models for battery, vehicle and fleet dynamics."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Scalable vehicle simulations for fleet statistics and complex systems analysis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The software can simulate any type of electric vehicle fleet in any part of the world."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Massachusetts, U.S. case study used to demonstrate the software\u2019s capabilities."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

To solve this problem, in this research, we propose two novel path selection algorithms called SNR-based learning path selection (NLPS) algorithm and SINR-based learning path selection (INLPS) algorithm, which are incorporated with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select the best multihop path from any source node to a destination node with highest end-to-end (E2E) throughput.

According to the numerical studies with the NLC is applied, our simulation results reveal that the proposed NLPS and INLPS algorithms can improve the overall average network capacity up to 3.1 times and 10.5 times compared to FG, respectively. However, the overall average computation time are highly increased for NLPS and INLPS, i.e., about 0.627 s and 1.221 s, respectively compared to FG, which is about 0.006 s.

Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) is one of the evolving technology to provide un-disrupted data connectivity to mobile users. It provides high bandwidth through efficient resource sharing, specially for areas deprived of wired connectivity. These networks also offer self-configuring, self-healing and self organizing capabilities. IEEE 802.11s is a MAC standard being proposed as an enhancement for WMN. This standard includes the use of a mandatory routing protocol at MAC layer, known as Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP). However, HWMP offers weak response to congestion, especially for interactive applications. IEEE 802.11s has also proposed sharing of Congestion Control Notification Frame(CCNF) on reaching congestion threshold. In this research paper, we have proposed a congestion avoidance technique named Congestion Avoidance Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (CA-HWMP). The proposed technique offers localized re-routing based upon congestion threshold, with minimal overheads. The re-routing decision is taken by the each node using CCNF received from the next hop neighbor. The proposed algorithm do not add any overhead as the CCNF is already the design part of 802.11s. This paper also shows comparison of proposed technique against HWMP under NS3 for the validation of proposed idea. From the comparison we concluded that use of CA-HWMP as replacement of HWMP significantly improves the performance of IEEE 802.11s."}]}]}]}}}

A security analysis is also performed on the network under study to identify source and data integrity vulnerabilities of the routing protocol.

Cooperative communications were introduced as a solution to the problem of limited spectrum availability. In this approach, numerous nodes share their resources and increase the bandwidth available to end-users. This research investigates the practicality of a new algorithm that optimizes resources based on load for Cooperative Communications in 5\u202fG WANETs. The algorithm consists of two components. Initially, a distributed algorithm for forming a topology is suggested. This algorithm employs a load-based approach to explore network conditions and efficiently choose the most suitable topology. An optimization algorithm that relies on a greedy strategy is suggested. In this approach, the chosen nodes send their bits to the receiver to maximize the attainable system throughput. A thorough simulation study is conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in assessing existing methods. The proposed model obtained 94.72\u202f% energy efficiency, 91.69\u202f% network throughput, 94.72\u202f% spectrum utilization, 27.47\u202f% network delay, 24.08\u202f% packet loss rate, 94.38\u202f% signal-to-noise ratio, 93.91\u202f% data transfer rate, 95.87\u202f% error detection rate, and 94.28\u202f% link reliability rate. The results demonstrate that the suggested algorithm significantly enhances the system and the overall network performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed approach is feasible and environmentally friendly for optimizing bandwidth in 5\u202fG wireless ad hoc Networks."}]}]}]}}}

However, the manifesto avoids talking about the business model of this infrastructure and neglects to give the appropriate role to each member of the community in building and maintaining this infrastructure. Moreover, current research misplaces FONN\u2019s cooperation in the avoidance of the tragedy of the commons and also overlooks ownership. The move from wireless to fiber has amplified the consequences of not considering ownership or member roles. In order to fill the previous gaps, in this article we will first relate the objectives of this manifesto to the field of free software. Next we will argue that FONN\u2019s cooperation should be placed in the avoidance of the tragedy of the anticommons. Inspired by free software we define a new business model for FONN besides discussing different ownership licenses. Furthermore, we state the roles of members and rigorously model the economic flow of construction and maintenance costs. The main implication of the proposed business model is that future FONNs will avoid the economic and organizational collapse of some current FONN communities, mainly because funding cannot be based solely on crowdfunding or volunteering. Yet, as an overall benefit, FONN avoids the duplication of infrastructure. This new business model has been used successfully in the fiber deployment of a FONN section."}]}]}]}}}

Data network provides also provides a huge bandwidth but the maximum speed for an end user is only a few Gbps which is speed of their devices. So if we use wavelength division multiplexing, maximum bandwidth utilization will be done because of simultaneous transmission of data.

Then we present a Reinforcement Learning-based orchestration plane that leverages local information for the enforcement of SD-WAN policies. Since traditional approaches suffer either a lack of scalability due to the problem\u2019s complexity or suboptimal performance due to isolated decision-making, the proposed approach leverages a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework. Our novel cooperative approach is based on per-site agents that exchange a small amount of information to enhance performance while preserving scalability.

Results show that our framework is able to satisfy global network policies for a multi-site SD-WAN with different QoS requirements and cost constraints."}]}]}]}}}

Thus, a defensive network with an IDS serves as the need for contemporary networks. The intrusion detection system has unavoidably evolved throughout the years, but despite this, it remains a difficult study topic since the current intrusion detection system uses signature-based approaches rather than anomaly detection. Therefore, improving the current intrusion detection system is challenging since it is difficult to find zero-day attacks in IoT networks when dealing with varied data sources. Filtered Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection with a Data Communication Approach is presented in this study. The five steps that make up the suggested model are Initialization of Sensor Networks, Cluster Formation and Head Selection, Connectivity, Attack Detection, and Data Broker. It was discovered that the suggested model for intrusion detection outperformed both the current Deep Learning Neural Net and Artificial Neural Network. In comparison to the most popular algorithms, experimental findings revealed a superior result of 96.12\u00a0% accuracy. The E-shaped patch antenna is a brand-new single-patch wide-band microstrip antenna that is presented in this research. A microstrip antenna's patch has two parallel slots built into it to increase its bandwidth. Investigating the behaviour of the currents on the patch allows for the exploration of the wide-band mechanism. A broad bandwidth is achieved by optimising the slot's length, breadth, and location. Finally, a 40.3\u00a0% E-shaped patch antenna is developed, made, and tested to resonate at 7.5 and 8.5\u00a0GHz for wireless communications.

Historically, the prioritization of economically efficient heat utilization was subdued due to favorable electricity feed-in tariffs. However, with the expiration of Renewable Energy Sources Act subsidies, operators shifted focus to the operational costs of district heating networks. This study aims to examine the effects of optimizing controllers and valves at district heating substations in single-family homes, utilizing two local district heating networks. The emphasis is on evaluating impacts on operating costs and determining whether the economic and energetic benefits justify implementation.

The non-linearity of the objective function and constraints of the HDN makes solving the OPF is more complicated.

The aim of the proposed algorithm is to find the stable path selection in ODMRP for forwarding packets. The basic on demand multicast routing protocol path selection uses minimum delay principle. The proposed algorithm considers node energy in path selection from source to destination. This article discusses the studies on output parameters such as control overhead and end to end delay by varying the input parameters viz., multicast groups size and mobility in the developed algorithm. Experimental results confirm that this approach can improve stability of path due to node energy consumption."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper we interest on analysis of wireless sensor network from an energy management perspective. The idea behind the energy-efficiency wireless sensor networks is that each node can only transmit to a limited number of other nodes directly. The limited resources of nodes imply that the transmission range is limited. In order to transfer the data to the final destination, the traffic must be relayed using intermediate nodes, creating a multi-hop route. The total energy consumption associated with an end-to-end transmission over such a route can be significantly reduced if the nodes are correctly configured.

This can lead to a significant disadvantage in terms of academic performance and future opportunities. Thus, a Remote Learning Management System (RLMS) is proposed. The study includes the development and testing of the RLMS system, as well as an evaluation of its acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model survey questionnaire. This system utilizes intranet networks and a Network File System to provide distant learning and teaching-based eLearning in far-flung and hinterland schools. The system intends to make sharing educational resources easier, such as to let students access their lessons, modules, and assignments, take exams and quizzes and even watch video lessons on their laptops, smartphones, and tablets, even without an internet connection. The results show that the RLMS system is fully functional and accessible, with positive acceptance and intention to use from teachers and students. Future studies can focus on enhancing the RLMS capabilities, improving user-friendliness, and providing in-depth training to teachers to maximize the system's potential. Overall, the RLMS system provides a viable alternative for blended learning in areas with slow and limited internet access."}]}]}]}}}

It presents significant business opportunities for operators, particularly in light of the exponential growth in mobile data traffic and the ongoing digital transformation. To effectively uphold the desired levels of QoS and QoE in the elevation of escalating digitalization and the unprecedented surge in data traffic, this paper presents offloading through a diverse range of technologies such as data offloading through Small Cell Networks (SCNs), Wi-Fi offloading, Device-to-Device (D2D) offloading, and data offloading through Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). The SCNs and Wi-Fi offloading involve migrating data traffic to the alternative infrastructure i.e. the small BS and the Wi-Fi Access Points (AP), respectively while D2D focuses on transferring data through the device without transversing the BSs. VANETs is the process of offloading data in vehicular scenarios that consist of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Additionally, mobile data offloading from cellular BS is categorized into four main factors: energy consumption or energy awareness, economic considerations, user satisfaction, and network congestion. These factors play a crucial role in the ongoing adoption and implementation of mobile data offloading strategies. Different technologies utilize diverse techniques to tackle the challenge of offloading, aligning with their specific research objectives.

However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination.

This paper addresses the challenges related to coverage range in outdoor monitoring systems utilizing LoRa, where the network performance is affected by the density of gateways (GWs) and end devices (EDs), as well as environmental conditions. To mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption, the proposed spreading factor (SF) and hybrid (data rate|SF) models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters. The orchestration of concurrent data modifications within the network server (NS) is crucial for uninterrupted communication between GWs and EDs, especially in monitoring electric vehicle (EV) stations to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Employing K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms optimizes ED allocation, averts data congestion, and improves the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR). These methods ensure seamless information reception by meticulously allocated EDs across various GW combinations. To estimate the free-space losses (FSL), a log-distance path loss model (log-PL) is used. Exploring various bandwidths (BWs), bidirectional communications, and duty cycles (DCs) helps to prevent saturation, thus prolonging the operational lifespan of EDs. Empirical findings reveal a notable packet rejection rate (PRR) of 0% for the DBSCAN (hybrid model). In contrast, the K-means exhibits a PRR ranging from 5% (hybrid model) to 35.29% (SF model) for the ten GWs combination. Notably, the network saturation is reduced to 10.185% and 9.503%, respectively, highlighting an improvement in the average efficiency of slotted ALOHA (91.1%) and pure ALOHA (90.7%).

The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV.

This has led to a high prevalence of link failures on the network. Upon failure, a network should be able to return to normal operational status within a considerable amount of time to avoid unavailability. This is done by employing link failure recovery strategies or mechanisms. A desirable recovery mechanism is one that enhances the reliability of the network, maintains low communication latency, and reduces the memory utilization of switching devices. In the common traditional network, it is a challenging task to determine the backup paths since the topology is static. Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture separates the control plane from the data plane, thus enabling dynamic network configuration and programmability. Hence, SDN enables network engineers to create both proactive and reactive backup paths in the network controller. Link failure is considered one of the most current research challenges in computer networks. This review paper analyse and compares the literature on recent SDN link failure recovery strategies. The existing link failure recovery techniques, their challenges, limitations, performance criteria, technologies/tools mostly adopted, and also the outline of how they can be improved is discussed."}]}]}]}}}

To address these issues, we propose cascaded recurrent networks with masked representation learning for high-resolution satellite stereo images, consisting of feature extraction and cascaded recurrent modules. First, we develop the correlation computation in the cascaded recurrent module to search for results on the epipolar line and adjacent areas, mitigating the impacts of erroneous rectification. Second, we use a training strategy based on masked representation learning to handle missing data and different domain attributes, enhancing data utilization and feature representation. Our training strategy includes two stages: (1) image reconstruction stage. We feed masked left or right images to the feature extraction module and adopt a reconstruction decoder to reconstruct the original images as a pre-training process, obtaining a pre-trained feature extraction module; (2) the stereo matching stage. We lock the parameters of the feature extraction module and employ stereo image pairs to train the cascaded recurrent module to get the final model. We implement the cascaded recurrent networks with two well-known feature extraction modules (CNN-based Restormer or Transformer-based ViT) to prove the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results on the US3D and WHU-Stereo datasets show that: (1) Our training strategy can be used for CNN-based and Transformer-based methods on the remote sensing datasets with limited data to improve performance, outperforming the second-best network HMSM-Net by approximately 0.54% and 1.95% in terms of the percentage of the 3-px error on the WHU-Stereo and US3D datasets, respectively; (2) Our correlation manner can handle imperfect rectification, reducing the error rate by 8.9% on the random shift test; (3) Our method can predict high-quality disparity maps and achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing the percentage of the 3-px error to 12.87% and 7.01% on the WHU-Stereo and US3D datasets, respectively.

Firstly, we defined CCNG and showed the characteristic analyses of CCNG. Then, we showed that the CCNG has the properties of Hamilton graph, and can be labeled using a Gray coding based recursive algorithm.

Moreover, a mobile node is always identified by a home address and it does not need to be configured with a care-of address during the mobility process, so the communication disruption caused by the address change is avoided. Through the proposed scheme, a physician can monitor the vital signs of a patient at any time and at any places, and according to the IPv6 address he can also obtain the location information of the patient in order to perform effective and timely treatment. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated based on the simulation, and the simulation data indicate that the proposed scheme might effectively reduce the communication delay and control cost, and lower the packet loss rate."}]}]}]}}}

Operating in challenging environments with stringent computational and power constraints within human vascular systems, these nanonetworks face significant hurdles. Successful transmissions between in-body nanonodes and on-body nanorouters are infrequent, requiring novel approaches to enhance network throughput under such circumstances. Traditional flow-guided nanonetworks rely on nanonodes to transmit packets if they possess sufficient energy, irrespective of their proximity to the nanorouter. In this paper, we present an extended model for legacy flow-guided nanonetworks that offers substantial throughput improvements while reducing the required number of nanonodes compared to the baseline blind transmission approach. By allocating transmission energy to allow more than one transmission during a charging cycle, our proposed model significantly enhances network throughput, facilitating the deployment of nanocommunication-supported medical applications.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap using anomaly detection techniques to discern hardware failure events in wireless community networks. For this purpose we use 4 unsupervised machine learning, ML, approaches based on different principles. We have built a dataset from a production wireless community network, gathering traffic and non-traffic features, e.g. CPU and memory. For the numerical analysis we investigated the ability of the different ML approaches to detect an unprovoked gateway failure that occurred during data collection. Our numerical results show that all the tested approaches improve to detect the gateway failure when non-traffic features are also considered. We see that, when properly tuned, all ML methods are effective to detect the failure. Nonetheless, using decision boundaries and other analysis techniques we observe significant different behavior among the ML methods."}]}]}]}}}

Despite numerous proposals and evaluations, the lack of standardised scheduling methods and comprehensive performance metrics remains a significant obstacle. Traditional network metrics often fail to capture key issues in TSCH-based mesh networks, potentially overlooking indicators of network stability. To address this gap, we examine both application and network metrics from a mesh network perspective and propose a set of complementary metrics tailored to the characteristics of TSCH. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of how scheduling impacts network reliability and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a wireless backhaul solution for UDN deployment by considering MultiPath-MultiHop (MPMH) backhaul architecture in mmWave frequency band. In addition, we propose a distributed routing scheme to forward the backhaul traffic over the multihop network. Backhaul capacity and line-of-sight probability of the proposed backhaul architecture for various picocell densities were compared with direct, multiple-association, and multihop backhaul schemes under interference limited scenarios in outdoor and indoor small cell deployments. The simulation results indicate that the MPMH mmWave backhaul is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for UDN deployment."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper we present the first hop redundancy concept and the means for its realization in IPv6 network. We evaluate three FHRP protocols, namely, the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRPv6), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv3), and Gateway Load Balancing (GLBPv6) using GNS3 tools. The First Hop Redundancy Protocols have been implemented, tested, optimized, and compared to one another in terms of convergence time, packet loss and convergence time. The comparison indicates which protocol is the best in each scenario and which is the best overall among the three protocols."}]}]}]}}}

However, in a vehicular environment, this connection is not stable due to the mobility of vehicles that results in location change, from the requester, the source, or both. To overcome these situations, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed as new architecture for data retrieval and mobility support. This new paradigm enhances content access and dissemination by decoupling the content from its original location. In this paper, we introduce the forwarding in NDN-based VANETs and highlight its benefits and limitations. We propose a classification of NDN-based VANETs forwarding strategies, then detail the representative schemes. Furthermore, we provide a review and comparison of existing forwarding strategies in terms of various attributes such as transmission mode, forwarding strategies, changes of NDN architecture, application scenarios, problem addressed, evaluation metrics, simulation platform. Finally, we conclude our contribution by identifying main open research challenges that can be exploited for future works. We believe that this survey will help NDN-based VANETs researchers community to easily understand the forwarding in vehicular environment, overcome some repeated solutions and gives further inspiration to design a new protocols to improve NDN-based VANETs networks in this context for further relevant research works."}]}]}]}}}

Openflow is a well-known architecture that facilitates SDN. The core idea of Openflow is to control the switch or router through programming from the centralized controller. The connection reliability is a major concern for the network service providers. The analysis of network resiliency is required for this new paradigm. The resiliency is the network's ability to survive against attacks and other component failures. This paper focuses on a comparison of different data forwarding algorithms currently supported by the POX standards for protection and restoration. Understanding existing approaches or standards in SDN plays a crucial role in network resiliency or protection and restoration. We also provide the extension of one of the components in POX for improvement. The restoration scheme in the current POX components as well as in the modified component is evaluated and compared."}]}]}]}}}

The optimal and sub-optimal lightpaths are found by the ants (control agents) depending upon the number of free wavelengths available, the length of the lightpath (hop count) and number of conversion required from source to destination. When a connection request arrives at a node, the high speed data are routed through the readily available optimal lightpath thereby reducing the processing time. The low speed data are first tried to groom over the existing low speed data, else routed through the readily available lightpath. As opposed to the reactive protocols, our proposed protocol is proactive in the sense that it proactively updates the changes in the network status using the concept of ant colony optimization. Further for survivability backup lightpath is maintained. The selection of backup lightpath is done in such a way that there is no shared link between the primary and backup lightpath but it can be shared with another backup lightpath. By simulation results, we showed that our proposed protocol has low blocking probability and delay."}]}]}]}}}

Through a wide-scale measurement campaign, we show that many autonomous systems in both access networks and the core of the Internet do permit the traversal of packets that include options, and that the path traversal currently depends on the type of network, size of the option and the transport protocol used, but does not usually depend on the type of included option. This is an encouraging result when considering the extensibility of IPv6. We show that packets that include an extension header can also impact the function of load balancing network devices, and present evidence of equipment mis-configuration, noting that a different path to the same destination can result in a different traversal result. Finally, we outline the current deployment challenges and provide recommendations for how extension headers can utilise options to extend IPv6."}]}]}]}}}

The results indicated that as WBGT increases, fewer pedestrians walk and more remain stationary. Sensitivity to WBGT was four times greater at 20:00 p.m. than at 08:00 a.m., despite similar WBGT levels. This may be because fewer people go out during the hottest part of the day, and the sum of those who go out during the day, i.e., those who return home, is greatly reduced.

The content of stream data can be unpredictable. Thus, instead of selecting a fixed plan, AMR dynamically routes batches of tuples to operators in the query network based on up-to-date system statistics. The workload of query access patterns in AMR systems is ever changing. Selecting a single best index may not efficiently support all query access patterns at all times. While maintaining multiple indices to match a variety of query access patterns increases overhead and decreases throughput. Index design, while paramount for efficient query execution, is particularly challenging in AMR systems as the indices must serve the continuously evolving query access patterns. Our proposed Adaptive Multi-Route Index (AMRI) employs a bitmap time-partitioned design that serves a diverse ever changing workload of query access patterns and remains lightweight in terms of maintenance and storage requirements. We propose a high quality yet efficient assessment method modeled after hierarchical heavy hitters that exploits route relationships by modeling the frequency of the search access patterns used as nodes in a lattice. We also design assessment scheduling methods for AMRI based upon detecting changes in the search access patterns used. Our AMRI incorporates migration strategies that seek to meet the needs of both old partially serviced and new incoming search requests.

The primary limitations of the FANET, which is used by the UAV swarm, are discussed. The radio link range between FANET nodes is based on a power budget and various propagation models. Whereas, for determining the UAV flight trajectories, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm based on the modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT).

This study evaluates two scenarios for powering the buses. In the first scenario, a grid-connected system is considered. The optimization aims to minimize annual costs related to capital, operation, and energy losses of the electric bus fleet. This involves determining the optimal locations for QWC stations, the length of power transmitters, and the corresponding battery capacities for the BEBs. Using MATLAB-based optimization tools Casadi and Yalmip, with solvers Bonmin and Fmincon, the optimal configuration includes a 13 kWh battery capacity and a 300 m power transmitter distributed across five bus stop areas. The second scenario employs a chance-constrained optimization approach for an isolated solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS). This system is designed to reliably meet the BEBs' energy requirements throughout the day, considering different seasonal data (winter, summer, all seasons/year-round). The optimization results for the PV and BESS capacities vary with the seasons: 394.247 kW and 2012.6 kWh using summer data, 1762.1 kW and 2738.2 kWh using winter data, and 1610.8 kW and 2741.9 kWh using year-round data. Additionally, the paper examines the impact of varying bus fleet sizes on the optimal battery size and power transmitter combination using a real-world example of the bus route between Khalifa City and Abu Dhabi Downtown in the UAE. The findings suggest that larger batteries with fewer or no charging stations are more economical for smaller fleets. Conversely, as the fleet size increases, a combination of smaller battery sizes and a greater number (and length) of QWC (power transmitters) becomes more cost-effective. This research offers significant insights into the efficient deployment of QWC stations and the integration of renewable energy and energy storage for sustainable urban electric bus networks. The proposed optimization models provide a systematic approach to designing and operating charging infrastructure, contributing to sustainable urban transportation systems. Moreover, the study highlights the influence of seasonal data on PV system sizing and costs."}]}]}]}}}

In this article we studied the analysis of the significant blackouts and cascading failures that have been happened in Pakistan in last few years. The authors proposed a new infrastructure for Pakistan energy sector by introducing advanced energy storage system and cutting edge technology like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology that make the existing power system robust against these phenomena. The advanced energy storage systems include like solid- state batteries that play a vital role to balance supply and demand, while V2G enables electric vehicles to contribute to grid stability. The potential of these technologies is helpful to improve the grid stability and facilitate a sustainable energy transition. The role of various electric companies in Pakistan power infrastructure has also been discussed after an occurrence of such unplanned events in power system. It has been noted that the main cause of power outages is fluctuation in frequency and voltage collapse. Finally, various solutions have been proposed to overcome these problems and make sure the reliability and stability of power grid against blackout phenomena."}]}]}]}}}

It allows participants to bid persistent piecewise-linear downward-sloping demand curves for portfolios of products, gradually adjusting positions toward targeted needs. Flow trading allows fine granularity of products in time and location, creating complete markets. Liquidity and computational feasibility are maintained despite trading millions of interrelated forward and real-time products. Participants manage risk and adverse price impact through trade-to-target strategies. The market operator clears the market every hour, finding unique prices and quantities that maximize as-bid social welfare.

This protocol is used to establish and maintain an active multicast tree surrounded by a passive mesh within a mobile ad hoc network. The multicast mesh is created by using route discovery concept. Pruning mechanism is used to eliminate the redundancies of mesh that is created by route discovery approach and it creates the multicast tree. M-EEMC effectively uses the knowledge of neighborhood node density and mobility so that they complement each other in discovering stable routes in a more energy-efficient fashion. Energy efficiency is achieved by eliminating most of the redundant data receptions. The proposed scheme is simulated over a large number of MANET nodes with wide range of mobility and the performance is evaluated. It is observed that proposed scheme produces better packet delivery ratio, less energy dissipation and reduced packet delay compared to on-demand multicast routing protocol (ODMRP)."}]}]}]}}}

The proposed router is based on an associative scheme that uses the attributes of the routing algorithm and the interconnection network topology. In this approach routing algorithms are mapped (or programmed) onto a set of bit-patterns that are matched in parallel. To show the applicability of this router, we have selected oblivious and fault-tolerant routing algorithms for ten different tree interconnection network topologies; however, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to accommodate other network topologies and routing algorithms. For the studied topologies, the number of required bit-patterns is of the same order as the topology degree. The proposed organization requires only one comparison and one read delays. This in turn yields a high-speed port assignment that is comparable to single topology routers (non-flexible routers). In the context of flexible router schemes, the proposed approach not only is one of the fastest but also requires a very small amount of hardware for its implementation."}]}]}]}}}

The constant need to increase economic feasibility, energy efficiency and safety while complying with emission regulations motivates further developments and improvements in voyage optimization and weather routing systems. These systems optimize a voyage based on meteorological and oceanographic information taking into account ship characteristics and routing information. The quality of the provided route not only depends on the quality of this data, but also on the modeling of the optimization problem and the algorithm chosen to solve it. Due to the wide range of mathematical approaches and consequently challenges in decision making, this paper aims to give a comprehensive and comparative overview of the existing state-of-the-art methods by a thorough literature review and elaboration of different modeling approaches, optimization algorithms, and their application in weather routing systems. The research shows that approaches range from modeling the weather routing problem as a constrained graph problem, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem or as combination of both. Based on the formulation of the ship weather routing optimization problem different methods are used to solve it ranging from Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programing and optimal control methods to isochrone methods or iterative approaches for solving nonlinear optimization problems. However, it can be concluded that the determination whether an approach is suitable, produces sufficient results and may be recommended, strongly depends on the specific requirements concerning optimization objectives, control variables and constraints as well as the implementation."}]}]}]}}}

Although the proposed methods can mitigate the problem of rapid battery depletion to some extent, the lifespan of sensor nodes is still a biggest constraint. Many studies conducted so far have shown continuous network functions with the help of external harvesting techniques. However, these provide low output because of the limitation on the energy capturing devices. Therefore, energy limitation strongly restricts the usage of wireless sensor nodes. This paper aims to provide high recharging rates and better energy efficiency by proposing a three-step mechanism, which is an extension of our existing proposed work J-ERLB (Joint Energy Replenishment and Load Balancing). In a three-step mechanism, topology selection followed by recharging and load balancing are combined together to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes. Topology selection is performed by implementing J-ERLB on various topologies like ring, star, and cluster. Further, taking advantage of Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) we focus on data collection and high-rate recharging. We have implemented System on Chip (SoC) integrated chip on UAV to achieve goal of perpetual network operations. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed mechanism is tested by comparing its numerical outcomes with existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG (Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering) techniques. The overall throughput for 3SM is doubled in comparison with the existing techniques, whereas the average remaining energy shows 6 times better savings for the proposed solution in comparison to the existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG when varying data rates is applied."}]}]}]}}}

Also, it might be a challenging task for a gadget of the multi-hop cause of competing network models due to the limited bandwidth available. The literature provides several studies on the issue of the multi-hop cloud environment. Moreover, partial offloading of multi-hop computing and dynamic network management leads to network problems. And inefficient performance measured in terms of task completion time has not been factored into current studies. To reduce the average finishing time of all jobs, this article proposed joint multi-task complete unloading and a network that supports the scheduling issue. Several variable decision factors such as the partial systematic ratio of offloading, Offloading remote devices, task start time, path of routing & dynamic network start time were optimized by the formulated problem. To manage tasks, we use the features inherent in multiple processors with various CPU frequencies. Under the restrictions of power & latency, we determine the appropriate quantity of task data to be handled immediately or distributed to the preferred nodes on the clouds remotely. Our objective is to solve the issue of optimization of task scheduling on a limited quasi-quadratic function. We offer an Improved Offloading and Heuristic Flow Optimization (IOHFO) solution effectively to solve these problems by using semi-definite relaxation. Finally, a simulator can be used to evaluate our proposed unloading system to reduce the (optimal) cost of unloading profiles for various parameters."}]}]}]}}}

But due to the limited memory and processing capabilities of the sensor nodes, the data must be transmitted to the central server for further analysis. To do this, routing via multi-hop channel is used which consumes a lot of particular SN's energy and also utilizes the resources, including the battery and memory of all the SN's involved in routing. This process drains the SN's energy rapidly and further leading to disconnection from the central server. To address this issue, mobile sink concept is introduced. The mobile sink collects the data from the SN's and hands it over to the central server which reduces the SN's involvement in data transmitting, but this process involves computationally complex tasks. In this context, we use linear programming to find the best visiting order to collect the information from a set of prioritized SN's, where other nodes transmit their data to them. We confirm that this process is computationally lightweight. In addition, this approach meat the performance criteria such as the lifespan of WSNs, the usage of buffer, throughput, and delay. We simulate the proposed model using Python, and they show improvement in efficiency when tested with different metrics of WSNs."}]}]}]}}}

Tri-band Wi-Fi 6E equipment addresses these needs by reducing the network congestion and enhancing the performance across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. However, improper band management can lead to frequent interference and network issues. As such, this work introduces a dynamic Wi-Fi link orchestration solution that follows a heuristic model. This approach aims to optimize the network layout and channel allocation based on device metrics, utilizing the EasyMesh specification for simplified network setup and management.

To combat the ever-evolving threats, adopting advanced models like cybersecurity mesh is necessary to enhance our protection. Cybersecurity mesh is an architecture scalable, flexible, composable, robust and resilient and allows the interoperability and coordination between intelligent systems to provide security services. Designing a cybersecurity mesh faces three major challenges: scalability, distributed or federated systems, and technology integration. For the design, it is necessary to apply security tools that support scalability because millions and millions of data are stored, processed, and analysed. Federated systems are needed to improve interoperability in a decentralized cybersecurity mesh. However, it can be tough to integrate different security tools and communication protocols. Cryptographic algorithms and AI models like federated learning, swarming intelligence and blockchain technologies are useful for security services. It is essential to study the integration of existing methods to determine the best technology for the job. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of intelligent systems, including federated learning, blockchain technology, and swarming intelligence, with a particular focus on how they have been and can be used to enhance cybersecurity. We examine the latest trends in these technologies, explore their connections, and weigh the pros and cons of each approach. To conduct this review, we utilized the Web of Science and Scopus databases and followed the PRISMA guidelines."}]}]}]}}}

However, the existing research works have some shortcomings, for example, although computing resource properties of individual nodes are considered, node storage properties and the network topology properties are usually ignored in Virtual Network (VN) modelling, which leads to the inaccurate measurement of node availability and priority. In addition, most static virtual network mapping methods allocate fixed resources to users during the entire life cycle, and the users\u2019 actual resource requirements vary with the workload, which results in resource allocation redundancy. Based on the above analysis, in this paper, we propose a dynamic resource sharing virtual network mapping algorithm named NMA-PRS-VNE, first, we construct a new, more realistic network framework in which the properties of nodes include computing resources, storage resources and topology properties. In the node mapping process, three properties of the node are used to measure its mapping ability. Second, we consider the resources of adjacent nodes and links instead of the traditional method of measuring the availability and priority of nodes by considering only the resource properties, so as to more accurately select the physical mapping nodes that meet the constraints and conditions and improve the success rate of subsequent link mapping. Finally, we divide the resource requirements of Virtual Network Requests (VNRs) into basic sub-requirements and variable sub-variable requirements to complete dynamic resource allocation. The former represents monopolizing resource requirements by the VNRs, while the latter represents shared resources by many VNRs with the probability of occupying resources, where we keep a balance between resource sharing and collision among users by calculating the collision probability. Simulation results show that the proposed NMA-PRS-VNE can increase the average acceptance rate and network revenue by 15% and 38%, and reduce the network cost and link pressure by 25% and 17%."}]}]}]}}}

Many researches have been studied to suppress the SI and IUI, to design the medium access control (MAC) protocol, and to propose resource management techniques for realizing the FD system and truly achieving the double transmission capacity in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel FD MAC protocol with a mixture of concurrent and sequential transmission scheme, namely FD-MCST, for maximizing the transmission capacity in multihop wireless networks. Through FD-MCST, the transmitting node can cooperatively share the transmission capacity status for maximizing the network capacity. As a result, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed FD-MCST can accomplish a higher achievable network capacity of up to 1.7 times and nearly twice the achievable throughput with a reasonable amount of achievable transmission overhead about 7.7%, compared to the existing FD MAC protocols."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e418", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e419"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e421", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e422", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e424"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e425"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e428", "view": "all"}, "_": "Cooperative mixture of concurrent and sequential transmission (MCST) scheme"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e430"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e433", "view": "all"}, "_": "Basic relaying flow transmission with the idea of the relaying node concept"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e435"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e438", "view": "all"}, "_": "FD medium access control protocol with MCST scheme"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories from upcoming IPCC reports."}]}]}]}}}

Subsequently, an attempt to compute the comprehensive recital of a non-beacon mode based 802.15.4/ZigBee integrated WSN network is demonstrated. An analytical model is designed using parameters such as back-off number, retransmission limit, and back-off exponent considering the impact of node-mobility which has not reported earlier. Further, the investigation is carried out experimentally by evaluating the different QoS metrics, for instance, throughput, network load, bit error rate (BER), received power, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and end-to-end delay for diverse node-density and network-size of a mobile Wireless Sensor Network.

This is achieved by using the overlay as a meta-structure to infer trust relationships providing a policy-based system, which is further enhanced with a Bayesian reputation based model so as to cope with the different challenges posed by the distributed nature of the system.

Repair crews (RCs) are regarded as crucial resources to provide system resilience owing to their mobility and flexibility characteristics in handling both transportation and energy systems. Nevertheless, effectively coordinating the dispatch of RCs towards system resilience is a complex decision-making problem, especially in the context of a multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) with enormous dynamics and uncertainties. To this end, this paper formulates the dispatch problem of RCs in a coupled transportation and power-gas network as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is proposed by featuring a two-level framework, where the high-level action is used for switching decision-making between transportation and power-gas networks, and the lower-level action constructed via the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is used to compute the routing and repairing decisions of RCs in the transportation and power-gas networks, respectively. The proposed algorithm also introduces an abstracted critic network by integrating the load restoration status, which captures the system dynamics and stabilizes the training performance with privacy protection. Extensive case studies are evaluated on a coupled 6-bus power and 6-bus gas network integrated with a 9-node 12-edge transportation network.

These methods embody proximity-aware extensions to the standard Bitcoin protocol, where proximity is measured geographically and in terms of latency. We validate our proposed methods through a set of simulation experiments and the findings show how the proposed methods run and their impact in optimising the transaction propagation delay. Furthermore, these new methods are evaluated from the perspective of the Bitcoin network\u2019s resistance to partitioning attacks.

Besides, a novel integrated wireless optical transport network emerges in access networks and supports joint fronthaul and backhaul services. Therefore, considering that the task offloading response time, the needs of proximity, and the ultra-dense 5G small cell deployment, a novelty hybrid cloudlet deployment scheme over fiber and wireless backhaul-aware infrastructure is created with efficient cost optimization in mind. In this work, the envisioned Fiber Wireless networks (FiWi) consists of optical backhaul and wireless fronthaul (i.e., integrated access network and backhaul link), whereby base stations (BSs) with fiber and wireless backhauls are referred as wired-BS (WBS) and unwired-BS (UBS), respectively. Therefore, to meet the quality of service (QoS) delay constraints, cloudlets can be deployed in either UBSs, WBS, or remote node (RN). However, we apply mixed-integer line programming (MILP) to resolve the convex optimization problem in terms of minimization deployment cost.

Based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology, network services can be flexibly and scalably provisioned as virtual network function (VNF) chains deployed at edge servers. With such advantages, both the industry and research communities have done extensive studies on deploying VNF chains at network edge. The existing works mainly take an ideal assumption that the network is totally safe and there are no malicious users. Therefore, they leverage all available resources to serve their users. However, such an assumption is impractical in real networks. Security services, such as firewall, deep packet detection, intrusion detection, are always required for production networks. The existing service deployment methods fail to consider the co-existence of security services and functionality services. In this paper, we present the topic of joint deployment of both security and functionality services, wherein the security services are responsible to check the data flows before being processed by the functionality services. To solve this problem, we propose the Secure Deployment Pattern, which aims to simultaneously satisfy the security protection and QoS requirements at network edge. It divides the services into two kinds, i.e., the user-oriented functionality services, and the service provider-oriented security services. In this case, it is very challenging to jointly deploy the security services and functional services with respect to the resource and latency constraints. We formulate this problem as an integer programming model, and propose the heuristic algorithms to solve it. As far as we know, this paper is the first step, which targets at a proper orchestration of security and functionality services in edge computing. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient, in terms of the execution time and the average number of served requests."}]}]}]}}}

When administered intravenously, they exhibit poor lung penetration and high systemic renal and ototoxicity, imposing to restrict their administration to 5 days. Experimental studies conducted in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep and pigs provide evidence that high doses of nebulized aminoglycosides induce a rapid and potent bacterial killing in the infected lung parenchyma. They also confirm that the alveolar-capillary membrane, either normal or injured by the infectious process, restricts the penetration of intravenous aminoglycosides in the infected lung parenchyma, precluding a bactericidal effect at the site of infection. However, injury of the alveolar-capillary membrane promotes the systemic diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides. Based on experimental data obtained in animals with inoculation pneumonia, it challenges the classical belief that nebulization protects against systemic toxicity. Loss of lung aeration decreases the lung penetration of nebulized aminoglycosides. Nevertheless, lung tissue concentrations measured in non-aerated lung regions with severe and extended pneumonia are most often greater than 5 times the MICs, resulting in a bactericidal effect followed by a progressive pulmonary reaeration. It is likely that the penetration into the consolidated lung, results from the bronchial diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides toward adjacent non-aerated infected alveolar spaces and their penetration into mechanical ventilation-induced intraparenchymal pseudocysts and distended bronchioles. In animals receiving nebulized aminoglycosides, epithelial lining fluid concentrations grossly overestimate lung interstitial fluid concentrations because of the bronchial contamination of the distal tip of the bronchoscope during the bronchoalveolar procedures. Lung microdialysis is the only technique able to accurately assess lung pharmacokinetics in animals with inoculation pneumonia treated by nebulized aminoglycosides. In 2024, the European Investigators Network for Nebulized Antibiotics in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (ENAVAP) called for the creation of an international research network for Lung Microdialysis applied to Nebulized Antibiotics (LUMINA) to promote multicentered, experimental, randomized, and controlled studies addressing lung pharmacokinetics of intravenous vs. nebulized antibiotics, using different dosing and ventilator settings."}]}]}]}}}

Numerical methods are often employed in the design and optimization phase of a given process, however, due to the multitude of interdependent physics required; the fast and efficient modelling of microwave heating in liquids remains a significant challenge, particularly with respect to computational resources. Here, we report a new multi-physics simulation methodology that models microwave heating of liquids during agitation, requiring less computational resources and delivering temperature predictions within 2.78 % of relative root mean square error. By applying the frozen rotor approach, near-perfect temperature profiles are predicted at approximately 600 times faster convergence time compared to the conventional sliding mesh method.

This method reduces the possibility of brute forcing the password, even if the handshake is captured."}]}]}]}}}

The topology of UAV communication network is the key to understanding and analyzing the behavior of UAV swarm, thus supporting the further prediction of UAV operations. However, the UAV swarm network topology varies over time due to the high mobility and diversified mission requirements of UAVs. Therefore, it is important but challenging to research dynamic topology inference for tracking the topology changes of the UAV network, especially in non-cooperative manner. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring UAV swarm network topology based on external observations, and propose a dynamic topology inference method. First, we establish a sensing framework for acquiring the communication behavior of the target network over time. Then, we expand the multi-dimensional dynamic Hawkes process to model the communication event sequence in a dynamic wireless network. Finally, combining the sliding time window mechanism, the maximum weighted likelihood estimation is applied to inferring the network topology. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}]}]}]}}}

Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques."}]}]}]}}}

Researchers have focused on the problems in the physical layer in order to exploit the properties of wireless optical channels. However, recent technological developments with successful results make it practical to explore the advantages of the high bandwidth. Some researchers have begun to focus on the problems of network and upper layers in FSO networks.

We formulate a new rank-mapping algorithm to reduce the maximum number of hops for the point-to-point communications. We evaluate both the new algorithm and the standard ones on the K computer, using the communication kernel of the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), a global atmospheric model with an icosahedral grid system. We confirm that, unlike the standard algorithms, the new one achieves almost perfect performance in the weak scaling on the K computer, even for 10,240 nodes.

This paper presents NetMon, a framework that gathers performance indicators inside the network service and at the same time allows an efficient spatial performance degradation localization capability. NetMon is technology agnostic and suitable for various network technologies ranging from legacy to the new type of services based on network function virtualization, chaining service functions or programmable network elements. The paper presents an original solution to the problem of scalable active network service monitoring with the capability to distinguish the measurements of different virtual networks. The proposed hybrid monitoring method which mixes the active probing and capturing this probe traffic provides a good trade-off between the granularity of the results and the traffic overhead created by the monitoring system itself. The system was tested in the pan-European GEANT network which connects European research and education infrastructures and showed reliable performance over long periods of time."}]}]}]}}}

It is a three-layer network including a core layer, an aggregation layer and an execution layer, which enhances the efficiency of multi-task distribution, aggregation and transmission. Furthermore, an AggreGate Flow (AGFlow) based scheduler is dedicatedly designed to maximize the task completion rate, whose key point is to aggregate flows belonging to one task during the multi-task transmission of UAVs network and to allocate priority by calculating the urgency-level of each AGFlow. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with that of state-of-the-art scheduler, the average task completion rate of AGFlow based scheduler is raised by 0.278."}]}]}]}}}

Current scheduling strategies, which hinge on strict isolation to ensure low latency and jitter, confront the challenges of high overhead in worst-case latency evaluation and consequent limitations in network flow capacity. This paper introduces an innovative framework that transcends traditional isolation constraints, thereby expanding the solution space and augmenting network schedulability. At the heart of this framework lies a novel latency jitter analysis method that assesses the viability of non-isolation scenarios with constant time complexity. This method underpins a heuristic scheduling algorithm that not only boasts the smallest time complexity among existing heuristics but also significantly increases the number of scheduled flows. Complementing this, we integrate a discrete time reference approach to hasten time-intensive scheduling operations, achieving an optimal balance between schedulability and runtime efficiency. The framework further incorporates a workload-shifting technique to enhance online scheduling responsiveness. It adeptly manages the variability in scheduling times caused by disharmonious flow periods, further bolstering the framework\u2019s robustness.

Load balancing is the allocation of the work of a single application to processors at run-time so that the execution time of the application is minimized. In order to achieve this purpose, load balancing algorithms require various network parameters to make decisions for effectively balancing the load. This paper analyses the scope of the application of network tomography to facilitate load balancing algorithms in estimating network parameters (packet loss and delay) to be used in decision making. This paper also exploits the interdependence of packet loss and delay in the context of load balancing. Evaluation results show that network tomography estimates link delays accurately from the knowledge of path delays and packet loss. This information is instrumental to be used to tune the delay dependence module of various load balancing algorithms."}]}]}]}}}

The main objective of WSN is to sense the crucial information from the environment depending on the type of application for which it is deployed and send this information to its Base Station(BS) so that it can take corrective action. These Sensor Nodes ommunicate with each other through various protocols. The problem of the conventional method is, during gathering of sensed data each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station for which it will deplete its power quickly. In this project, we propose PEGASIS(Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System),a near optimal chain-based protocol for extending the lifetime of network. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbour, performing a chain, elect a leader from the chain who collects the data from the neighbours to be transmitted to the base station. As a result the average energy spend by each node per round is reduced and to lower the bandwidth requirement. By using certain algorithm we can propose the shortest path of transmission of data to the base station. As a result less power consumption can be achieved to increase efficiency and life time of the network."}]}]}]}}}

This research extends their application to network investments and travel demand by examining the co-evolution of public transport access and ridership in the Greater Sydney region for a period spanning over a century, from 1855 onward. We hypothesise a mutual feedback between public transport ridership and access, and corroborate the hypothesis in all causal models estimated \u2013 between aggregate public transport ridership and access, station ridership and access, and mesh block public transport shares and access. The causality was more evident in disaggregate models and was stronger between ridership and access to jobs than with access to population when employment data were available.

This paper proposes a Distributed Hash Table based File Sharing Scheme for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks using multipath routing protocol. The scheme guarantees multi-path forwarding due to its underlying property of reactiveness and its application of proactive routing protocol. The packets are transferred to distant nodes with assistance of created Distributed Hash Tables which store information about identities of sender's as well as receiver nodes. By using Multi-path Dynamic Address Routing the algorithm utilizes the best available path until it fails to switch to the next best available route in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves realistic performance of file delivery and also has comparative performance with the existing protocols."}]}]}]}}}

There has been many researches going on which is based on caching approaches in the Content centric network. Efficient caching is essential to reduce delay and to enhance performance of the network. Along with caching, a good cache replacement scheme is also necessary to decide which content item should reside in the cache and which content should be evicted.

The continuum traffic equilibrium model treats the road system as a continuum over which the demands are continuously dispersed. In this study, a bi-level model is set up for finding the most vulnerable location(s) in the study region. At the lower-level model, a set of differential equations is constructed to describe the traffic equilibrium problem under capacity degradation. In the upper-level model, a constrained minimization problem is set up to find the most vulnerable location(s) that minimizes the accessibility index of the study region.

The route involves using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) to manufacture thin-walled tubes, which are then laser micro-machined to directly produce customised stents, cutting short the laborious process and overcome the design limitations for stents manufacturing. Different post processing techniques were used to improve the surface finish and cell attachment properties of the tubes. Finite Element (FE) modelling was used to simulate stent crimping and deployment. The study identified the key parameters that control the performance of the final product, including the optimum laser scanning strategies during L-PBF to achieve smooth thin-walled tubes, and the use of electropolishing to improve the surface finish and cell attachment. FE simulations showed that TNTZO can achieve crimping ranges up to 74% following the optimisation of the strut diameter, which brings us one step closer to a Ni-free alternative to nitinol in manufacturing stents that require significant deformation."}]}]}]}}}

This paper proposes Flooding Factor based Framework for Trust Management (F3TM) in MANETs. True flooding approach is utilized to identify attacker nodes based on the calculation of trust value. Route Discovery Algorithm is developed to discover an efficient and secure path for data forwarding using Experimental Grey Wolf algorithm for validating network nodes. Enhanced Multi-Swarm Optimization is used to optimize the identified delivery path. Simulations are carried out in ns2 to assess and compare the performance of F3TM with the state-of-the-art frameworks: CORMAN and PRIME considering the metrics including delay, packet delivery ration, overhead and throughput. The performance assessment attests the reliable security of F3TM compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks."}]}]}]}}}

The incorporated built environment characteristics include the type of bicycling infrastructure, tree canopy, slope, land use mix, and vehicle traffic.

In such a file sharing system, nodes meet and exchange requests and files in the format of text, short videos, and voice clips in different interest categories. Content is various and large file sharing such as the multimedia content is required with the rapid development of the wireless communication technology. File sharing can also mean having an allocated amount of personal file storage in a common file system. A P2P content based file sharing system, for efficient file searching, threshold takes advantage of node mobility by designating stable nodes, which have the most frequent contact with community members, as community coordinators for intra community searching, and highly mobile nodes that visit other communities frequently as community ambassadors for intercommunity searching. The large file sharing needs more stable end to end path and long transmission time. Last but not least, more relationship between nodes will be used to promote the file sharing process. Content based file sharing is helpful for taking certain decisions during file transmission. These decisions will benefit in proper utilization of network resources. In this paper content-based file sharing scheme using threshold is proposed. The user's interest is determined by the proposed scheme before searching and sharing the files in the peer-to-peer network.

Existing methods of voice quality estimation are compared on different voice codecs tested on a network topology suffering from distortions of real network. Finally, a regression analysis is employed to provide better understanding of impact of network conditions (delay, jitter, packet loss) on the VoIP service quality.

Aggregating the results of air traffic flow simulations using the winds on a large number of days spread over a year will achieve this but requires considerable time and effort, and a method to obtain a reasonable evaluation using a small set of representative wind conditions and a minimum number of simulations is desired. This paper proposes using clustering to achieve this. To avoid having to cluster large meteorological data sets and to reduce the dimensionality of the data, we used Pacific Organised Track System (PACOTS) tracks as a surrogate for wind conditions since these are calculated considering the daily winds aloft. For a schedule of ten major trans-Pacific flight services, we compared statistical trends over a full year of routes and those on wind days chosen by five candidate methods, which consisted of clustering and non-clustering methods.

For achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER), we introduce some fundamental results on the basis of iterative message-passing algorithms for Low Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy dissipation in decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are considered. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code rates and introduce Adaptive Itera- tive Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold on the number of iterations for a certain BER (10\u22124).

It is known that when the network is trouble-free, load balance is needed, and when there are some links destroyed in the network, a protection mechanism is needed. This new algorithm includes these two mechanisms while also adopting a kind of QoS guaranteed mechanism.

A real case study was carried out in the city of Bari, Italy, to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results showed how it is possible to define areas for intervention with different priorities based on the expected severity index.

Their stylistic and typological features helped distinguish local products and imports by appearance. In the last 40\u00a0years, combined lead isotope and chemical analyses of metals have been widely applied to verify hypotheses based on style and typology. This paper is a comprehensive typological and analytical study of a metal item hoard discovered in Paszowice, SW Poland. In the Bronze Age, the area was inhabited by the Lusatian Urnfield culture (ca. 1350/1300\u2013800/750 BC) communities. We expected that at least some of the artefacts would be local products fashioned according to foreign stylistic patterns. The research aimed to determine whether a \u2018classical\u2019 stylistic analysis combined with provenance studies of metals would allow more decisive conclusions. This combination of methods could also show how the metal reached the Lusatian Urnfield culture settlement zone. We conducted a detailed typological and chronological analysis to map the distribution of similar artefact types. It demonstrated that stylistic matches for the artefacts from Paszowice occur mainly in NE Hungary, S Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania. Selected metal artefacts (both tin bronze items and raw copper objects) from Paszowice were also analysed for their chemical (EPMA) and lead isotope (MC ICP MS) compositions. The study revealed many copper sources used for their production, ranging from the nearest copper mines in the Slovak Ore Mountains, through Eastern Alps and mines in Sardinia, to possibly the Iberian Peninsula. In this way, we identified the potential trade routes by which metal could get to SW Poland: the southwestern and southeastern routes and the Mediterranean-Danube route. The Iberian metal might have also reached the study area from the north \u2013 through its redistribution by Scandinavian traders. Our results show that metal from many sources circulated in central Europe during the Late Bronze Age. The Lusatian Urnfield communities were part of a pan-European exchange network and maintained extensive long-distance contacts, allowing metal acquisition from various sources."}]}]}]}}}

Two control modes were developed for the operation of an SOP, using back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). A power flow control mode with current control provides independent control of real and reactive power. A supply restoration mode with a voltage controller enables power supply to isolated loads due to network faults. The operating principle of the back-to-back VSCs based SOP was investigated under both normal and abnormal network operating conditions. Studies on a two-feeder medium-voltage distribution network showed the performance of the SOP under different network-operating conditions: normal, during a fault and post-fault supply restoration. During the change of network operating conditions, a mode switch method based on the phase locked loop controller was used to achieve the transitions between the two control modes. Hard transitions by a direct mode switching were noticed unfavourable, but seamless transitions were obtained by deploying a soft cold load pickup and voltage synchronization process."}]}]}]}}}

Environment monitoring has become an important field of control and protection, providing real-time system and control communication with the physical world. An intelligent and smart Wireless Sensor Network system can gather and process a large amount of data from the beginning of the monitoring and manage air quality, the conditions of traffic, to weather situations. In this paper, we discuss and review wireless sensor network applications for environmental monitoring. In order to implement a good monitoring system, there are several requirements to be followed.

We then bring forward a novel interconnection network of DQcube, which is a compound graph of disc-ring graph and hypercube. That is, it uses the hypercube as a unit cluster and connects many such clusters by means of a disc-ring graph at the cost that only one additional link is added to any node in each hypercube. The topological benefits of both basic graphs are preserved in the compound network. It utilizes the topological properties of hypercube to conveniently embed parallel algorithms into each cluster and the short diameter of disc-ring graph to support an efficient inter-cluster communication. The proposed methodologies for DQcube are further applied to many other compound graphs of disc-ring graph and hypercube-like graphs, including locally twisted cube, twisted cube, crossed cube, and M\u00f6bius cube, with diameter being a half of that of hypercube.

In such networks, wake-up radio (WuR) is gaining its popularity thanks to its on-demand transmission feature and overwhelming energy consumption superiority. Despite this advantage, overhearing still occurs when a wake-up receiver decodes the address of a wake-up call (WuC) which is not intended to it, causing a certain amount of extra energy waste in the network. Moreover, long latency may occur due to WuC address decoding since WuCs are transmitted at a very low data rate. In this paper, we propose two schemes, i.e., early sleeping (ES) and early data transmission (EDT), to further reduce energy consumption and latency in WuR-enabled IoT/WSNs. The ES scheme decodes and validates an address bit-by-bit, allowing those non-destined devices go to sleep at an earlier stage. The EDT scheme enables a sender to transmit small IoT data together with WuC packets so that the main radio does not have to be in full operation for data reception. We implement both schemes through a WuR testbed. Furthermore, we present a framework based on M/G/1 and assess the performance of the schemes through both theoretical analysis and simulations."}]}]}]}}}

This necessitates a sophisticated and accurate evaluation of multimedia service quality within the sphere of wireless networks. To systematically address the nuanced issue of user experience quality, the present study introduces a novel method for evaluating multimedia Quality of Experience (QoE) in wireless networks, employing an advanced deep learning model as the underlying analytical framework. Initially, the research undertakes the task of modeling the video session process, giving due consideration to the status of each temporal interval within the session's architecture. Subsequently, the challenge of QoE prediction is dissected and investigated through the lens of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), culminating in the proposition of an all-encompassing QoE prediction model that harmoniously integrates video information, Quality of Service (QoS) data, user behavior analytics, and facial expression analysis. The empirical segment of this research serves to validate the efficacy of the suggested video QoE evaluation method, engaging both quantitative and qualitative comparison metrics with contemporaneous state-of-the-art QoE models, employing the RTVCQoE dataset as the empirical foundation. The experimental findings illuminate that the QoE model elucidated in this study transcends competing models in performance metrics such as PLCC, SRCC, and KRCC. Consequently, this investigation stands as a seminal contribution to academic literature, furnishing an exacting and dependable QoE evaluation methodology. Such a contribution augments the user experience landscape in multimedia services within wireless networks, and instigates further scholarly exploration and technological innovation in the mobile Internet domain."}]}]}]}}}

To achieve an efficient WPT, a lot of resources may be required for the model which necessitates a high computational time. Hence, compared to using only a 3D simulation software as reported in many literature, a co-simulation is performed between HFSS and OptiSLang to reduce computational resources. Furthermore, using MATLAB to conceptualise the CSCMR resonators gives better guidance and satisfactory results which shortens the simulation times by providing estimated WPT system parameters for an optimal model. The study concludes that, using the co-simulation has reduced computational time by 93% compared to only using the full-wave electromagnetic simulation (HFSS) which translates to quicker design time of WPT."}]}]}]}}}

In some instances, there may be multiple intended data destinations (sinks) in a WSN. This calls for multi-CB. In comparison to sink-by-sink CB, multi-CB implies improved data rates and decreased co-channel interference; and consequently increased network capacity. In current literature, there is no research in multi-CB particularly in 3-dimension WSNs. In this paper, a novel multi-CB mechanism is brought to the fore. This is from the point of view of a random arrangement of sensor nodes in a 3-dimension manner. It is assumed that all sinks' directions are known at the CB cluster head. Node transmit amplitude and phase are optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm variant to concurrently achieve balanced multiple narrow beams and minimal radiation in undesired directions. The performance of the proposed scheme is checked against that of a pure multiple beam steering approach (without beam power balancing and minimization of radiation in undesired directions). Moreover, an analysis of beam power, width and steering accuracy is done upon varying the number of collaborating nodes and the collaborating cluster radius. Increasing the count of collaborating nodes yields improved beam precision/accuracy, lower radiation in undesired directions and appreciable stability in beam power performance Increasing the collaborating nodes' cluster radius yields narrow beams, improved beam precision and appreciably lower radiation in undesired directions. The contributions of this work to current literature include: (i) formulation and analysis of a multiple beamforming scheme in the realm of 3-dimension WSNs; (ii) design of a multi-CB scheme taking into account minimization of radiation in undesired directions; (iii) a statistical multi-CB performance analysis upon varying collaborating nodes' cluster radius and collaborating node count."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "ab0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0340", "view": "all"}, "_": "Wireless Sensor Network; Collaborative beamforming; Multiple beamsteering"}]}]}]}}}

The WSN measurements are frequently contaminated and altered by noise. The noise in the signal increases the sensor node\u2019s computation and energy utilization, resulting in less longevity of the sensor node. The Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is commonly employed in WSN to pre-process sensed signals to remove noise from the sensed signals using delay elements, multipliers, and adders. Traditional multiplier-based FIR filter designs result in hardware-intensive multipliers that consume a lot of energy, and area and have low computation speed. These drawbacks make them unsuitable for IoT-based WSN systems with stringent power efficiency necessities. Approximate computing enhances the energy efficiency of an FIR filter. Arithmetic circuits utilizing approximate computing improve the hardware performance, with some loss of accuracy to save energy utilization and boost speed. A novel approximate multiplier architecture employing a fast and straightforward approximation adder is proposed in this study. Approximate multiplier M1 using OR gate and approximate multiplier M2 using proposed approximate adders are compared. The proposed approximate adder is suited for building an adder tree to accumulate partial product (PP) because it is less complicated than traditional adders. Compared to a one-bit-full adder, the critical path delay (CPD) is reduced significantly in the proposed methods. The accuracy comparison of M1. M2 and Wallace tree using the normalized mean error distance (NMED), the mean relative error distance (MRED), the maximum error (ME), and the error rate (ER) with the number of bits utilized for reducing error. For the area (delay) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.4\u00a0ns for M1, 0.43\u00a0ns for M2, and 1.08\u00a0ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. For the delay (area) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.16\u00a0ns for M1, 0.16\u00a0ns for M2, and 0.40\u00a0ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. To more accurately evaluate performance at the circuit level, the PDP and ADP are computed. The NMED, MRED, ME, and ER versus PDP and ADP are computed. The proposed multipliers M1 and M2 are compared with existing approximate multipliers. When an equivalent MRED, NMED, or ER is taken into account, M1 has the smallest ADP and PDP among other multipliers. The very low likelihood of a significant ED occurring is indicated by the small values of NMED and MRED in M1 and M2. The proposed solutions effectively reduce delay, area, and power while maintaining increased accuracy and performance."}]}]}]}}}

By using free and open-source software packages including MQTT Mosquitto Broker, InfluxDB, Node-RED, and Grafana, the system can collect, store, and visualize data, offering an effective means of studying a PV system performance from anywhere. The proposed system is found to work efficiently under different testing conditions; providing precise measurements for different parameters, including voltage, current, power, ambient temperature, humidity, panel temperature, PV coolant temperature at inlet and outlet, and spectral irradiance. In addition to the data collected by the set of sensors, the system provides another source of environmental data using a web-based service called \"OpenWeatherMap\" that provides a complete global forecast. Alerts and thresholds have been successfully implemented in our system, providing an added advantage of being able to detect and respond to any anomalies in the collected data.

Thus, SG architecture includes several communication schemes to ensure the best transmission of power and satisfy the consumer\u2019s requirement. To reach these ambitions, the transmission must be established at time and without error. In the traditional transmission, every consumer transmits the power demand using a TDMA mechanism which prolongs the delay. In this paper, the purpose is to suggest a model that can quickly transmit the power demand and achieve a good performance in terms of delay. The scheme is called Cooperative Wireless Transmission for Smart Neighbor Area Network (CWT). The cooperative means that all consumers can participate and coordinate between them to transmit the total power. So, the first purpose is to gather the total power of all consumers simultaneously and rapidly by employing QPSK modulation so that to improve the throughput, the second one is to evaluate the performance of CWT in terms of Cooperative Symbol Error Rate (CSER) and Estimated Power (EP).

Unfortunately, the technical details have mainly been kept confidential so far. In this paper, we attempt to analyze the percolation properties of large-scale WBNs, considering both homogenous and heterogenous wireless nodes. In order to do so, we modeled a WBN as a large-scale random network where the path-loss models of homogenous and heterogenous WBNs were reduced to GDM (Gilbert's Disk Model) and RGDM (Random Gilbert's Disk Model), respectively. The bounds of the critical density regime were derived for both percolation models. Additionally, this paper implemented an experimental test bed for the WBN percolation model.

Thus a prior knowledge about the state of the channel will help in selecting the proper aggregation size that would utilize the channel bandwidth and improve the system performance. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that adjusts the aggregation size based on the ACK bitmap without adding any extra headers or messages for determining the network conditions. Simulation results show that the Acknowledgment Bitmap can be used as an indicator of the network conditions to create adaptive frame aggregation schemes."}]}]}]}}}

This scheme is based on communication among home appliances, a central energy management unit (EMU), smart meter and the storage unit inside home. A wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN) using ZigBee protocol is employed for relaying messages among different entities involved in our proposed HEM scheme. The performance of WSHAN is analyzed with respect to different networking properties. HEM implementation will lead to socially and economically beneficial environment by addressing the consumers\u2019 and utilities concerns. Increased savings, better peak load management and reduction in peak to average ratio are some of the benefits achieved by proposed scheme. Appropriate use of HEMs in a system integrated with distributed resources along with appliances co-ordination and dynamic pricing scheme provides the optimized solutions for energy management issues in smart grids as confirmed by simulation results."}]}]}]}}}

However, due to measurement noise and fading effects, it is usually estimated through probe or learning based methods, which result in high energy consumption or high overheads. We propose to make use of information redundancy among indicators provided by the IEEE 802.15.4 system to improve the estimation of the link quality. A Kalman filter based solution is used due to its ability to give an accurate estimate of the un-measurable states of a dynamic system subject to observation noise. In this paper we present an empirical study showing that an improved indicator, termed Effective-SNR, can be produced by combining Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) with minimal additional overhead. The estimation accuracy is further improved through the use of Kalman filtering techniques. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be implemented on resource constraints devices typical in WSNs."}]}]}]}}}

Dust attenuation has been the focus of many research works, mainly with the deployment of a 5G wireless network in the FR-2 band (mmWave band, 23\u201353\u00a0GHz with TDD). This has led to the development of novel models to accurately predict and estimate attenuation. However, the existing review works have not adequately provided extensive taxonomies for these models to show the state-of-art and future research directions. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive review of all electromagnetic scattering models in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and applications. Lessons learned from the detailed survey have been stated and discussed extensively. Key findings from this review indicate that all the models developed were limited to the region where they were developed, with frequency and visibility levels as the two main parameters. The survey across regions showed no model was developed for Region 2, including the Americas, Greenland, and some of the eastern Pacific Islands. Among the dry regions of the globe, where dust and sand storms can occur either occasionally or frequently, it can be seen that only a few parts of these desert regions of Africa (Region 1) and Asia (Region 3) have been considered by authors for the development of prediction models for attenuation due to dust storms. Thus, this also shows the limitations of the overall deterministic models and presents the crucial need to develop new models or modify existing models to accurately predict dust attenuation in other regions, particularly in Africa."}]}]}]}}}

Thus, conformal, soft, breathable, wireless epidermal sEMG sensor systems have broad potential relevance to clinic rehabilitation settings. Herein, we demonstrate a stretchable epidermal sEMG sensor array system with optimized materials and structure strategies for hand gesture recognition and hand function rehabilitation. The optimized serpentine structures with marvelous stretchability and improved fill ratio, provide lower impedance and high-quality sEMG signals. Moreover, the easy-to-use airhole method further ensures stable and long-term contact with the skin for recording. In addition, integrated with a customized flexible wireless data acquisition system, the capability for real-time 8-channel sEMG monitoring is developed, and taking together with the CNN-based algorithm, the system can automatically and reliably realize the 7 kinds of hand gestures with an accuracy of 81.02%.

We propose a novel approach to address this problem, by combining a neural network (NN) for predicting future user\u2013AP visibility probability, with a probability threshold for AP reselection to avoid unnecessary reconfigurations.

The simulation results are presented in this paper. In our simulations the HT-MCSs were tested in networks with Friis, Nakagami, and log-distance propagation models for studying their performance under various signal attenuation and fading effects. The HT-MCSs provided consistent performance under most channel conditions in our simulations. However, they showed significantly degraded performance under the log-distance propagation model when the communication distance was relatively long because of the high signal attenuation in such a case. Our simulations also showed that an increased number of radio beams increased the ability of the modulation and coding schemes in combating adverse channel conditions."}]}]}]}}}

These algorithms compute node positions based only on the connectivity, i.e. the neighborhood information of each node. Many algorithms have been proposed for positioning in stationary node systems and bounds on positional error of algorithms have been derived. The design and analysis of positioning algorithms for mobile node systems is a more challenging problem. Node mobility increases the amount of positional information available to a positioning algorithm. The work in this paper establishes a bound on the positional error for connectivity-based algorithms in mobile systems. The formulation from the analysis is used to investigate the benefit of this additional positional information on reducing positional error. There is a limit to the usefulness of positional information from previous node positions due to movement.

Analyzing the impact of each replacement level (replacement of conventional DOCRs by DS-DOCRs) on the protection performance/efficacy of individual network lines is challenging as each deployment level leads to different primary and backup relay protection pairs, which may lead to miscoordination. Also, the random and uncertain nature of faults leads to numerous possible scenarios, which need to be rigorously considered during the analysis. As a more complete and accurate analysis approach, we propose to utilize probabilistic model checking, which is a formal verification technique, for the performance verification of DS-DOCRs-based protection schemes. A formal analysis methodology to determine the optimal deployment of DS-DOCRs. The proposed analysis requires formal models of the behavior of fault, C-DOCRs, and DS-DOCRs-based protection systems, and these models are developed as part of our work. Moreover, we also formalize the quantitative properties to determine the impact of various relay deployment scenarios on the performance of the protection system. For illustration purposes, we use formal models for the quantitative verification of a state-of-the-art DS-DOCRs-based protection scheme for power distribution networks using the probabilistic model checker.

However, allocating computational resources to fog nodes and mapping these resources to IoT subtasks is a key challenge in this area. This work models the parallel task offloading problem as a graph-matching problem and utilizes a many-to-many matching technique to achieve a stable mapping of IoT subtasks to fog node resources. Unfortunately, the proposed solution is subject to the problem of externalities due to the dynamic preference profiling of fog nodes.

This scheme is performed at both sides of communication: (1) LoRa nodes are designed to sleep periodically to save more power; (2) LoRa gateway must send packets with long preamble to maintain the reliability of downlink communication. In addition, an energy model is built to prove that an optimal cycle period exists for LoRa nodes to save more energy.

This chapter enumerates about the layout of oil pipeline system and its sensor measurement and instrumentation deliberately placed on the long run pipelines. The evolution of smart grid application enhances this oil transportation in a much corporate band by accumulatively orienting the sensor network in the utilization of power resources. Further, through the wireless communication associated with the smart grid, the pigging inspection gauges are exploited in the desired geographical area with better power consumption. Existing research on communication technologies in SG is briefly overviewed with the main focus on Cloud computing approaches. In this paper, the Smart Grid architecture and its applications are focused on entire oil pipeline from inlet to distribution substations first. The Cloud Computing architecture is explained thoroughly. Then, Cloud Computing for Smart Grid applications are also introduced in terms of efficiency, security and usability. Cloud platforms technical and security protocols are analyzed. Finally, the inspection of oil pipeline system by receiving sensor data of smart pigs incorporated with the cloud computing technique associated with smart grid application is elaborated with its SCADA hierarchical architecture. Further, simulation analysis of wireless sensor nodes with Flexmeter platform for power monitoring over smart pig case scenario is also presented with its layer-wise characterization."}]}]}]}}}

As a result, a novel model for estimating various types of gas leakage in pipeline systems is examined, put to the test, and contrasted. Five distinct scenarios are seen during the leakage testing procedure using data fusion, where the optimization is done using the fuzzy interface technique.

However, most applications of UAVs for wireless communication provisioning are not feasible as researchers fail to consider some vital aspects of their deployment, especially the energy requirements of both the UAV and communication system. The considerable energy consumption overhead involved in flying or hovering UAVs makes them less appealing for green wireless communications. Therefore, in this work, we examine the feasibility of an alternative energy-efficient deployment scheme where UAVs can be made to land-on designated locations, also known as landing stations (LSs). The idea of LS makes the UAV-based wireless communication more durable and advantageous, since the total energy consumption is reduced by minimizing the flying/hovering energy consumption, which, in turn, enables diverse set of applications including emergency and pop-up networking. We evaluate the impact of the separation distance between these LSs and the Optimal Hovering Position (OHP) on the network performance. Specifically, we develop mathematical frameworks to model the relationship between UAV power consumption, coverage probability, throughput, and separation distance. Numerical results reveal that a significant energy reduction can be achieved when the LS concept is exploited with a slight compromise in coverage probability and throughput. However, the choice of a suitable LS location depends on the users\u2019 service requirements, transmit power, and frequency band utilized."}]}]}]}}}

However, due to such characteristics of mmWave, as short transmission distance, high sensitivity to the blockage, and large propagation path loss, handover issues (including trigger condition and target beam selection) become much complicated. In this paper, we design a novel handover scheme to optimize the overall system throughput as well as the total system delay while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) of each User Equipment (UE). Specifically, the proposed handover scheme called O-MAPPO integrates the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm and optimization theory. The RL algorithm known as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) plays a role in determining handover trigger conditions. Further, we propose an optimization problem in conjunction with MAPPO to select the target base station. The aim is to evaluate and optimize the system performance of total throughput and delay while guaranteeing the QoS of each UE after the handover decision is made. The numerical results show the overall system throughput and delay with our method are slightly worse than that with the exhaustive search method but much better than that using another typical RL algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper the hierarchical structuring is done using clustering approach based on efficient data aggregation process. The aggregation process is defined into two phases. The first phase defines the arrangement of the nodes in the cluster using uniform distribution and second phase defines the selection of the cluster head and aggregation of the data using linear programming.

cloud model from multiple views. With the development of deep learning, more and more learning-based research has achieved remarkable results. However, existing methods ignore the fine-grained features of the bottom layer, which leads to the poor quality of model reconstruction, especially in terms of completeness. Besides, current methods still rely on a large amount of consumed memory resources because of the application of 3D convolution. To this end, this paper proposes a Multiple Granularities Feature Fusion Network for Multi-View Stereo, an end-to-end depth estimation network combining global and local features, which is characterized by fine-granularity multi-feature fusion. Firstly, we propose a dense feature adaptive connection module, which can adaptively fuse the global and local features in the scene, provide a more complete and effective feature map for inferring a more detailed depth map, and make the ultimate model more complete. Secondly, in order to further improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed point cloud, we introduce normal and edge loss futead of only using depth loss functions as in the existing methods, which makes the network more sensitive to small depth structures. Finally, we propose distributed 3D convolution instead of traditional 3D convolution, which reduces memory consumption. The experimental results on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed method in this papaer achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which proves the accuracy and effectiveness of the MG-MVSNet proposed in this paper."}]}]}]}}}

The goal of this research is to find a way to charge electronic devices wirelessly using radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic (EM) waves (Rectenna using energy detection-based spectrum sensing). Mechanical deformations cause frequency detuning, which lowers the effectiveness of antennas and rectennas that would otherwise allow wireless communication and RF energy harvesting in the far field. A rectenna based on a stretchable multiband antenna is designed as a self-powered system to perform reliably and integrate RF power received across its multiband despite mechanical deformations. Depending on what the battery needs, the proposed multiband antenna will work at 900\u00a0MHz, 1800\u00a0MHz, 2100\u00a0MHz, and 2.45\u00a0GHz as both an RF transducer and an RF energy harvester. Depending on the received RF power density (high), the receiving RF wave will be utilized for both communication and RF energy harvesting (RF-EH) when the battery's current voltage is less than 20% (referred to as \u201clow voltage\u201d). Otherwise, the received RF wave will be used only for RF-EH. The installed multiband rectifiers function perfectly in terms of efficiency and bandwidth.

In this paper, we propose HANNA, a human-friendly provisioning and configuration framework for smart devices, that extends the zero-touch paradigm to large IoT deployments by introducing voice assisted configuration in combination with large scale ad-hoc communications to overcome the initial installation effort of IoT deployments. The most prominent role in HANNA is played by the assisting device, which includes a voice assistant capable of correctly understanding a minimum number of keywords required for initial provisioning and configuration of the devices. The device\u2019s role is to interact with the user and ensure that all provisioning details are received. These are then converted into appropriate machine instructions for further use by the mass provisioning mechanism. We provide an example prototype implementation of HANNA and evaluate the performance of the assisting device in the human-to-machine communication phase and the performance of the selected communication technique in the machine-to-machine communication phase. Our results show the potential of existing speech-to-text engines for this application area and also reveal shortcomings with respect to the robustness of the engines in office-like working environments as well as with respect to user\u2019s gender and language proficiency level. Additionally we show that the proposed machine-to-machine provisioning approach is always faster compared to manual provisioning for cases with more than ten devices."}]}]}]}}}

This research presented an overview of the application of communication technologies in the digitalization of the power systems network. It reviews smart grid communication technologies, their features, relevance, and various roles being played toward delivering an effective electrical service to stakeholders. Hence, this study focused on wireless and wired communication technologies applicable to smart grid applications. Based on the review, each communication technology has its strengths and weaknesses; hence in selecting the most appropriate technology for application in a smart grid, a compromise must be made. Therefore, for choosing the most preferred communication technology in any smart grid application, it is important to deploy the efficacy of multi-criteria methods. To serve as a case study, a framework for selecting a communication technology for advanced metering infrastructure is proposed and applied.

Specifically, RSS-based weights are dependent on the change in RSS of communication links to remove improbable target locations. To ensure robust tracking performance, distance-based weights are assigned to probable target locations. Angle-based weights are used to ensure the correct direction of motion.

However, ensuring quality of service (QoS) in multichannel ad hoc networks is crucial and most of the existing signaling and adaptation mechanisms for QoS available in the literature mainly supports fixed-width channels or variable-width channels that restrict network performance. In this paper, we propose a Hyper-Erlang Channel Allocation Factor-based QoS Enhancement Mechanism (HECAFQEM) for improving the support capability of ad hoc networks. HECAFQEM uses a composite model that models the availability and performance of the prevailing channel conditions through Hyper-Erlang Factor that quantifies the rate of rejection of the network. The degree of rejection of user request depends on queuing delay, transmission delay and two significant parameter called Channel Allocation factor (CAF) and Expected Channel Allocation Factor (ECAF). The QoS adaptations are performed by HECAFQEM by measuring the queuing delay that helps in segmenting the packet stream into small bursts for enhancing the degree of QoS. This distributed mechanism enhances QoS through the estimation of Channel Allocation Factor (CAF) that dynamically adapts channel widths in a multichannel ad-hoc network to suit bandwidth adaptability. The performance analysis of HECAFQEM is carried out based on ns-2 simulator and the proposed approach shows an improvement on an average by 23% and 19% in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput than the existing QoS adaptation mechanisms available in the literature."}]}]}]}}}

The lower bound for this range is always fixed as zero, irrespective of the backoff stages and congestion in the network. This causes the backoff procedure to select the smaller value even when the network is heavily congested thus increasing collisions and congestion. To resolve this unbalanced backoff interval problem, this paper proposes a Channel Status based Contention Algorithm (CSCA) which regulates the backoff interval based on the number of retransmission attempts by packets and vehicle density for the non-safety applications. The network simulation is carried out using NS3 along with SUMO for highway traffic and results are shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the default EDCA and Adaptive EDCA (A-EDCA) methods in terms of packet collision rate, throughput and delay."}]}]}]}}}

When the other radio frequency (RF) performance of the components is well designed, passive intermodulation (PIM) interference may become an important factor limiting the system\u2019s SNR. Whether it is a base station, an indoor distributed antenna system, or a satellite system, there are stringent PIM level requirements to minimize interference and enhance network capacity in multicarrier networks. Especially for systems of high power and wide bandwidth such as 5G wireless communication, PIM interference is even more serious. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of PIM, measurement is the most important means to study and evaluate the PIM performance of wireless communication systems. In this review, the current main PIM measurement methods recommended by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and other standard organizations are introduced, and several key challenges in PIM measurement and their solutions (including the design of PIM tester, the location of the PIM sources, the design of compact PIM anechoic chambers, and the evaluation methods of PIM anechoic chambers) are highlighted. These challenges are of great significance to solve PIM problems that may arise during device characterization and verification in real wireless communication systems."}]}]}]}}}

Agriculture Intrusion Detection System can be used with wireless sensors in order to detect the intruders in the agriculture field and sends an alert message to the user which exchange information among internet connected devices based on the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Main objective is to identify the suitable topology for the transmission of Data from various sensor nodes. Nodes are placed in the field at various topologies like star topology, Bus topology, P2P Topology, Mesh Topology.

However, with the increasing of control scale, traditional centralized control algorithms are experiencing significant increase of computational complexity and physical implementation challenging. To address this issue, a diffusion collaboration-based distributed Filtered-x Least Mean Square algorithm applied to active vibration control is proposed, drawing inspiration from the concept of data fusion in wireless sensor network. This algorithm distributes the computation load to each node, and constructs the active vibration control network topology of large-scale system by discarding the weak coupling secondary paths between nodes, achieving distributed active vibration control. In order to thoroughly validate the effectiveness and superiority of this algorithm, a helicopter fuselage model is designed as the research object. Firstly, the excellent vibration reduction performance of the proposed algorithm is confirmed through simulations. Subsequently, specialized node control units are developed, which utilize STM32 microcontroller as the processing unit. Further, a distributed control system is constructed based on multi-processor collaboration. Building on this foundation, a large-scale active vibration control experimental platform is established. Based on the platform, experiments are carried out, involving the 4-input 4-output system and the 8-input 8-output system. The experimental results demonstrate that under steady-state harmonic excitation, the proposed algorithm not only ensures control effectiveness but also reduces computational complexity by 50%, exhibiting faster convergence speed compared with traditional centralized algorithms. Under time-varying external excitation, the proposed algorithm demonstrates rapid tracking of vibration changes, with vibration amplitudes at all controlled points declining by over 94%, proving the strong robustness and adaptive capability of the algorithm."}]}]}]}}}

This paper bridges the gap created by these unilateral technology developments using a multi-disciplinary approach including placing cautions when necessary and suggesting viable alternatives for optimal utilization of these energy transfer and conversion techniques. Through theoretical analysis, simulations, and tests on lab-scale experimental prototypes, the impact of our proposal is showcased. Thermal and loss models are developed for self-healing asphalt. Also, integration study of solar roads and contactless charging is performed. Applying the insight gained from the results, it is discussed how some challenges also pave a way towards interesting opportunities, for instance, infrastructure sharing for material use optimization and efficient mosaic integration. Finally, an economic viability case study is presented for a future Dutch highway with such newly emerging components."}]}]}]}}}

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming.

In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based UAV relay policy for maritime communications is proposed to resist jamming attacks. Based on previous transmission performance, the relay location, the received power of the transmitted signal and the received jamming power, this scheme optimizes the UAV trajectory and relay power to save the energy consumption and decrease the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the maritime signals. A deep reinforcement learning-based scheme is also proposed, which designs a deep neural network with dueling architecture to further improve the communication performance and computational complexity. The performance bounds regarding the signal to interference plus noise ratio, energy consumption and the communication utility are provided based on the Nash equilibrium of the game against jamming, and the computational complexity of the proposed schemes is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes improve the energy efficiency and decrease the BER compared with the benchmark."}]}]}]}}}

People hold great prospects for this emerging technology. In order to realize the upgrading of the digital twin industrial chain, it is urgent to introduce more modalities, such as vision, haptics, hearing and smell, into the virtual digital space, which assists physical entities and virtual objects in creating a closer connection. Therefore, perceptual understanding and object recognition have become an urgent hot topic in the digital twin. Existing surface material classification schemes often achieve recognition through machine learning or deep learning in a single modality, ignoring the complementarity between multiple modalities. In order to overcome this dilemma, we propose a multimodal fusion network in our article that combines two modalities, visual and haptic, for surface material recognition. On the one hand, the network makes full use of the potential correlations between multiple modalities to deeply mine the modal semantics and complete the data mapping. On the other hand, the network is extensible and can be used as a universal architecture to include more modalities. Experiments show that the constructed multimodal fusion network can achieve 99.42% classification accuracy while reducing complexity."}]}]}]}}}

It allows accurate node connection even with a small number of RSSI values by eliminating the outliers.

The proposed ILP model represents the operation of Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations.

the rapid development of flexible/stretchable electronics, wireless technology for wearable systems starts to gain momentum.

The study of the representative stretchable microstrip antenna reveals the effects of the geometric parameters on its electromagnetic properties. Although the non-dimensional parameters have been shown to uniquely determine the mechanical properties of the serpentine mesh structure, their influence on the coupled mechanical-electromagnetic properties is different in the stretchable antenna. This study systematically reveals the effects of the non-dimensional parameters at various tensile strain levels from the coupled mechanics-electromagnetics simulations, with experimental validations. The mechanical stretchability of the serpentine mesh structure increases as the arc angle increases or the normalized width (i.e., the ratio of the width to radius) decreases. The normalized width together with the change in radius and width provides an effective means to tune the initial resonance frequency, impedance matching, and radiation pattern of the stretchable antenna without altering the strain sensitivity. Additionally, the advanced laser micromachining technology for the manufacturing of the stretchable microstrip antenna can also be explored to the other stretchable microwave devices."}]}]}]}}}

Point cloud video streaming enables detailed 3D representations for applications like 3D scanning, AR, and VR. However, high data demands and complex encoding pose challenges, requiring efficient resource and latency management. As a result, user experience (UX) is critical in the metaverse, where metrics like real-time feedback, Quality of Experience (QoE), and adaptive UX design are essential for sustaining engagement in immersive 3D environments. Therefore, this paper closely examines the latest developments in point cloud video streaming, specifically focusing on user-centric, AI-driven, and low-latency techniques, transcending traditional video streaming methods. We investigate a variety of techniques, pinpoint obstacles, and chart prospective routes for elevating both the quality and depth of immersive experiences. Furthermore, our work includes a detailed qualitative comparison of these streaming paradigms. We also shed light on pivotal metaverse enhancers, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Visible Light Communication (VLC), advanced network coding techniques, and the integration of the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK).

Nonetheless, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have a tendency to change their network topology frequently because of the mobility of vehicles. Since there will be many handovers, network performance will be negatively affected. A new architecture called Software Defined Network (SDN) can be used to make the vehicular network more efficient by making network devices that connect to each other programmable. This research proposes a seamless handover system in which the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Media-Independent-Handover (MIH) Framework are used to implement dynamic topology changes in VANETs. VANET as well as Internet of Things (IoT) plays a good role on the handover scheme. IoT gives a better results in the traffic management, security and connectivity. In order to demonstrate the dominance of our proposed model, network simulations are carried out from a variety of angles and perspectives. The results reveal that when a handover occurs, our solution can greatly enhance network performance. The performance can be evaluated in the form handover delay, handover failure ratio, throughput and packet loss with 5%, 40%, 10% and 2% improved with the existing methods."}]}]}]}}}

By diverting the attention of potential attackers and siphoning off their resources, honeypots are a powerful tool for protecting critical assets within a network. However, the cybersecurity landscape constantly evolves, and professional attackers are always working to uncover and bypass honeypots. Once an adversary successfully identifies a deception mechanism in place, they may change their tactics, potentially causing significant harm to the network. Maintaining a high level of deception is crucial for honeypots to remain undetectable. This paper explores various deception techniques designed specifically for honeypots to enhance their performance while making them impervious to detection. Previous research has not provided a detailed comparison of these techniques, particularly those tailored to honeynets. Therefore, we categorize the presented techniques into relevant classes, subject them to a comparative analysis, and evaluate their effectiveness in simulation scenarios. We also present a mathematical model that comprehensively represents and compares various honeynet research endeavors. In addition, we provide insightful suggestions that highlight the existing research gaps in this field and offer a roadmap for future expansion.

However, one of the main issues yet to be solved is how it scales with an increasing number of Wi-Fi devices injecting location-specific traffic in the shared medium. While the recently released IEEE 802.11az standard will still take time before being integrated in COTS devices, this paper aims at assessing the impact of the burst size on the ranging performance of COTS Wi-Fi Android devices running release 12. While increasing the burst size is expected to bring higher stability in the observed distance, on the other hand a longer transmission period for location-only purposes may jeopardize the transmission of data traffic among Wi-Fi users. Several models of smartphones and APs, and different frequency bands, have been considered in order to evaluate the behavior of the FTM procedure in real devices, showing that not always the newest or most expensive ones perform better. Also, it is shown that using the minimum burst size significantly decreases the performance and it is thus not recommended. While bursts longer than 8 may no be always supported by all the models and/or frequency bands, the small improvements in ranging estimations obtained when they are used do not always justify the increased location traffic injected in the network."}]}]}]}}}

So eventually traditional searching techniques are still widely used. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model is the major candidate for the internet traffic mainly due to its decentralized nature. This article evaluates classic flooding, random walk and gossip based resource discovery algorithms under mobile peer-to-peer (MP2P) networks and studied their performance. Further we suggest way to improve these algorithms to suit and work better under MANET. We compare the performance in terms of success rate, query response time, network overhead, battery power consumed, overall dropped packets, MAC load, network bandwidth, packet delivery ratio, network routing load and end to end delay. The experiments are validated through NS-2 simulations."}]}]}]}}}

In order to study the performance of Distributed CSP (DisCSP) algorithms in a truly distributed setting, we use a discrete-event network simulator, which allows us to model the impact of different network traffic conditions on the performance of the algorithms. We consider two complete DisCSP algorithms: asynchronous backtracking (ABT) and asynchronous weak commitment search (AWC), and perform performance comparison for these algorithms on both satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances of SensorDCSP. We found that random delays (due to network traffic or in some cases actively introduced by the agents) combined with a dynamic decentralized restart strategy can improve the performance of DisCSP algorithms. In addition, we introduce GSensorDCSP, a plain-embedded version of SensorDCSP that is closely related to various real-life dynamic tracking systems. We perform both analytical and empirical study of this benchmark domain. In particular, this benchmark allows us to study the attractiveness of solution repairing for solving a sequence of DisCSPs that represent the dynamic tracking of a set of moving objects."}]}]}]}}}

In the last phase of the decision support scheme, the relevant stakeholders are involved in selecting the most suitable arrangement.

To minify the transmission losses, the concurrent data exploits data parallelism for updating transmission parameters at the network server (NS) for non-interruptive communication between the centroid gateways (GWs) and allocated EDs. The EDs are deployed by K-means at different locations in each cluster based on spreading factor (SF) and data rate (DR) to avoid data congestion and intra-SF interference for the SF and hybrid (DR/SF) models. The varying bandwidths (BWs) and duty cycles (DCs) enhance the lifespan of the EDs, while the Bayesian game parameter selection (BGPS) method minimizes the power losses among the EDs. The one-slope estimates medium losses; the adjusted R-square predicts variance; and Pearson finds a correlation among the measured values.

The success of BLE as a cornerstone in the Internet of Things (IoT) and consumer electronics is both an advantage, enabling short range, low cost, and low power consumption wireless communications, and a disadvantage, from a security and privacy standpoint. BLE exposes packets that enable a potential attacker to detect, enquire and fingerprint actual devices despite manufacturers\u2019 attempts to avoid detection and tracking. Medium Access Control (MAC) address randomization was introduced in the BLE standard to solve some of these issues. In this paper we discuss how to detect and fingerprint BLE devices, basing our analysis and data collection on interactions allowed by the standard. In our study, we propose the Bluetooth Low Energy Nodes Detect, Enquire, (and) Recognition (BLENDER) framework for enumerating and fingerprinting BLE devices for crowd monitoring and recognition purposes, based on four different strategies used to analyze BLE-enabled devices. We will show that it is possible to associate BLE randomized MAC addresses to actual devices. We will then describe a proof of concept for large-scale data collection. In addition, to determine the spots where the stations could be optimally positioned, we created a synthetic dataset based on mobility models and then we emulated the BLENDER approach. The latter allowed training Machine Learning models to predict the expected number of devices appearing at any particular position, day, and hour."}]}]}]}}}

Then, we propose a binary linear programming model to enhance the reliability of the system under the Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER). The model minimizes the number of deployed APs by taking into account the constraints on the available synchronous SPs.

Meanwhile, the optically transparent RISs are demanded in some application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a 2-bit metalmesh-based RIS with high optical-transparency. By analyzing the surface current distributions on the element, we employ the metalmesh-grid patterns and metalmesh-stripe patterns on the top and ground layers respectively. The metalmesh patterns can help improve the optical transparency of RISs, while maintaining similar microwave characteristics. The RIS can reach the optical transparency of 79%, and the reflection amplitude is greater than \u22123.2\u00a0\u200bdB within the operating band. Finally, to verify the capability of the proposed RIS in wavefront controls, the far-field scattering patterns of the RIS with different coding sequences are investigated and the simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical results."}]}]}]}}}

To overcome this issue, we propose a time-slotted scheme, called TS-VP-LoRa, which supports multiple transmission times and packet sizes at the same time. In TS-VP-LoRa, scheduling is coordinated by the LoRa gateway, broadcasting beacon frames periodically for the synchronization of LoRa end-devices. A channel hopping mechanism is also proposed in order to minimize the occurrence of collisions and to evenly split the transmission load among all channels. TS-VP-LoRa is evaluated and compared to three other MAC-layer schemes in single gateway simulation scenarios with up to 500 nodes. The proposed scheme has proven to achieve low latency with high packet delivery ratios, significantly minimize collisions and maintain a relatively low energy consumption despite the scaling of the LoRa network."}]}]}]}}}

Using efficient Internet-mediated information integration, data from various sources can be consolidated for enhanced disaster management. This paper reviews the current state of digital early warning platforms for open-pit mines using a Web of Science database search for pertinent literature. The framework, data layer, technology layer, and application layer of these platforms are investigated in order to identify associated technologies and obstacles. Important results include: (1) Inconsistent data formats and monitoring software diminish platform workflow efficiency. Robust data exchange protocols and feature-rich software could increase efficiency. (2) Platforms rely on limited data types as opposed to intelligent algorithms that integrate diverse monitoring inputs into global disaster predictions. The underutilization of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and cloud computing.

Within the SSI model, a digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a secure and trusted manner. At present, the existing SSI solutions rely on the Internet connection for carrying out the necessary operations such as messaging and credential verification. However, there are many places the Internet may not be accessible and other means for communication is needed. The objective of this paper is to design a proof-of-concept that would allow for secure, trustworthy, and decentralized peer-to-peer communication without the need for any external networking infrastructure. For this, we investigate a particular case involving DIDComm and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We identify requirements for the architecture and propose an architectural framework that allows two entities to securely communicate and exchange verifiable credentials. Furthermore, we look at a specific use case, namely, how offline access control can be enabled within SSI between two mobile devices. We present and evaluate the implementation of offline access control system based on the proposed architecture. Through this research, and experimentation we can conclude that this approach has the potential to enable a wide range of interesting use cases and can be integrated into existing digital identity wallet solutions to extend the capabilities of offline messaging in a secure and decentralized manner that goes beyond the current models that rely on the Internet connectivity."}]}]}]}}}

In this work, we design, develop and demonstrate high power density nonlinear wideband energy harvesters using novel tapered spring architectures in an autonomous wireless sensor node system. These spring structures exhibit a nonlinear restoring force arising from the atypical stress distribution that can be additionally tuned by changing the taper-ratio in the structure. We investigate different tapering designs in order to achieve optimal spring hardening nonlinearities. This nonlinearity aids in widening the operable bandwidth, making the harvesters suitable for scavenging energy from real-world broadband vibrations.

Industry 4.0 technologies (such as robotics, digital twin technology, and IoT solutions) decrease human interaction in the preparation phase of a new production series.

In the case of reduced power transmission distance, the IPT system will enter an over-coupled state, causing the system output power to change drastically and the system to detune, and frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting will also occur. This paper first theoretically deduces the root cause of the output power variation of several typical topological IPT systems under over-coupled conditions, and then analyzes their frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting characteristics by numerical analysis methods, which can provide a reference for the design of IPT systems.

Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication have been emerging. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial on three typical edge computing technologies, namely mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications of these three technologies are summarized and compared. From the viewpoint of radio access network, the differences between mobile edge computing and fog computing are highlighted, and the characteristics of fog computing-based radio access network are discussed.

The paper argues about on-air time, receiving blind times due to processing and intra system interference, buffer saturation and frequency anchoring. Hence, a compensation procedure based on collision rate estimation is proposed. Results with the refined method show that occupancies of 40% can be measured with an overestimation error whose percentile 95% is 5 percentage points. This is reduced to 1.9 points when the occupancy is 15%. The sniffers perform in real time and are shown to correctly track short term load variations. The strategy has been successfully used to characterize occupancy in highly variable and loaded scenarios such as subway platforms and a shopping mall. Values up to 25% have been observed, which implies a relevant packet error rate. Hence, the tool can be used to make agile audits and configure the parameters that control communication redundancy in new or existing networks."}]}]}]}}}

This study presents a field demonstration of a real-time predicted mean vote (PMV)-based HVAC control strategy in a typical residential building under hot and dry climate conditions. This study introduces an advanced thermal comfort-based controller (TCC) for the PMV-based HVAC control. TCC continually assesses indoor and outdoor thermal conditions and adjusts the HVAC setpoint temperature to optimize real-time energy use while ensuring satisfactory indoor thermal comfort. Machine learning models for the PMV-based HVAC control system are employed to estimate a mean radiant temperature (MRT) point, which is one of the variables used to calculate real-time PMV values. Three machine learning models (i.e., linear regression, regression trees, and artificial neural network) are adopted in this study with non-stationary real-time input values, including times, pre-determined setpoints, and indoor and outdoor temperatures. The developed TCC is installed in a full-scale experimental house in Kuwait, which is under hot and dry climate conditions, to assess the house's indoor thermal comfort and AC energy efficiency performance. Results indicate that the TCC provides better thermal comfort performance compared to the non-TCC case, including up to a 60% improvement in PMV. The proposed TCC controlled by the machine learning methods demonstrates HVAC energy savings potential of over 20% while meeting the desired thermal comfort levels in the experimental building. These findings are expected to be valuable, as they can contribute to reducing cooling energy in residential buildings in hot and dry climate conditions."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0155", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "A real-time predicted mean vote-based air-conditioning control method is proposed."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "This study utilizes various data-driven models for extimating mean radiant temperature."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "The effectiveness of thermal comfort-integrated air-conditioning control is demonstrated through a case study in Kuwait."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

To enhance robustness in detecting the situations in which PPEs are not used correctly, we take advantage of Machine Learning to analyse the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) between PPEs in the same OAN The novelty of this work is that it does not exploit RSSI as a proxy of the distance but instead recognizes a signature of the correct wearing of the PPE By employing this system, employers can effectively ensure the proper usage of PPE devices at their worksites while also minimizing any adverse effects on workers\u2019 comfort and reducing the setup burden for employers. The system runs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model several times per second and employs a post-processing algorithm to enhance its initial accuracy further As a result, the system effectively reduces false positives by about 80% and swiftly detects instances of improper usage of the worker\u2019s PPE, raising the alarm in less than seven seconds.

In the proposed scheme, location updates are based on the value of a movement counter. The update of the movement counter is based on information on the locations visited by a mobile terminal (MT) since the last location update. In particular, the cell identifiers and the corresponding movement counter values are maintained in the MT for a part of the visited cells since the last location update. When the MT enters a cell whose identifier is not stored in the MT, the movement counter increases by one. If the movement counter reaches the update threshold, a location update is triggered; otherwise, the cell identifier and the corresponding movement counter value are stored in the MT. When the MT enters a cell whose identifier is in the MT, the movement counter is assigned with the counter value kept in the MT for this cell, and all cells with greater counter values in the MT are removed. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic selection of the update threshold according to each user's calling and mobility patterns. Analytical and simulation models have been developed to compare the proposed scheme with both the movement-based scheme and the distance-based scheme. Results demonstrate that when the call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) is low, the proposed scheme can achieve a significant cost reduction compared to the movement-based scheme. For example, when the CMR is 0.01, a savings of around 25% in the optimal total cost per call arrival is achieved with the proposed scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme is easier to implement than the distance-based scheme."}]}]}]}}}

Much of the thermal energy inside of buildings is wasted by means of transmission through conventional windows. Low emissivity (low-e) windows have been incorporated as an effective method to minimize energy utilisation because of their ability to reflect external heat radiation, thus reducing cooling loads. Such windows have been widely used in the architectural and automotive sectors to block both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation from the Sun. The windows consist of multi-layer thin coatings (metallic and dielectric layers), which are highly transparent in the visible but reflective to IR radiation (heat). However, the metallic layers attenuate telecommunication signals used for modern-day telecommunications such as radio frequency (RF) and microwave (\u03bcW) signals. As there is an ever-increasing demand for a reliable interior to exterior mobile communication coverage, these windows need to be transparent for reliable wireless communication. A class of engineered materials is a promising solution to improve signal transmission through low-e windows; by applying a frequency selective surface (FSS) pattern onto the window. FSS can be realised by producing a periodic of repetitive shapes incorporated onto the window surface to filter selective electromagnetic waves.

This study presents a highly selective triple-notch UWB-MIMO antenna, which consists of a four-radiating patch antenna and an isolator. The single-element antenna consists of a radiating patch, substrate, ground plane, electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures, and split ring resonators (SRR). To achieve the designated UWB bandwidth, the lower edges of the antenna patch are cut by a quarter-circle radius. The three sharp notches are achieved by utilizing four EBGs and two SRRs at the back of the antenna. The notch bandwidth can also be controlled by changing the parameters such as the width and length of the EBG structure and SRR. The single antenna is then translated into 4-port MIMO systems. The high correlation between elements is reduced by inserting a unique parasitic decoupling structure. The decoupling structure is designed in a way that reduces the mutual coupling in all passbands.

Therefore, we implemented fully-fledged solutions and conducted large-scale experiments to reveal the scalability characteristics of both approaches. We found that our VIM extension can be a valid option for single-provider setups encompassing even 100 edge domains (Points of Presence equipped with multiple servers) and serving a few hundreds of customers.

Due to the limited spectrum resources, we cannot provide separate spectrum bands for each individual wireless multimedia application. Cognitive radio plays a vital role in providing spectrum resources to these applications. Cognitive radio enables wireless users to sense temporal and spatial unused channels and correspondingly adapt their transmission strategies. These unused channels may be occupied by the primary users(PUs) at any time, creating those channels unstable, which makes it difficult to meet the QoE requirement of secondary users using these unstable channels. Therefore it is essential to study how to manage the available spectrum resources among a set of secondary users based on their QoE requirement and stability of these channels. Historical QoE under different channels are investigated by SUs and these data are sent to cognitive radio base station(CRBS) and this base station allocates the channel based on QoE requirement and the historical data. At the time of any change in channel allocation due to arrival or departure of any user in the system, channel allocation should be modified such that degradation of QoE due to channel switching should be minimal."}]}]}]}}}

The goal is to create a more intelligent and responsive system that can effectively cater to consumer needs while simultaneously improving the reliability and efficiency of contemporary energy infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key enabling technology for Smart Energy Hubs (SEH). While IoT offers a plethora of innovative solutions across various sectors, including critical infrastructure, it also introduces new security challenges. Since IoT devices inherently connect to the internet, SEH systems become susceptible to a wider range of cyberattacks. This vulnerability heightens as the number of integrated IoT devices increases. A single compromised device can expose the entire hub to cyber threats. Such attacks on energy sources have the potential to cripple entire cities, resulting in significant economic devastation. Therefore, robust security measures must be implemented before the widespread adoption of IoT-based devices in energy systems. This research delves into the architecture and infrastructure of IoT-enabled SEH. Following this, the focus shifts to analyzing the primary challenges and security concerns associated with their deployment. Finally, the research emphasizes cutting-edge approaches and tools that can bolster the security and resilience of IoT-enabled SEH against contemporary physical and cyber threats.

We find that there is vacuum on the level of integration that considers the interdependence of local or decentralized decision making in an adaptive power system. This gap is widened by the absence of policies to enhance resilience in power networks. While there is significant coverage and convergence of research on algorithms for solving the multi-objective problem in optimization routines, there are still uncharted territories on how to incorporate system degradation while designing these self-restoration systems.

The leg members have circular cross-sections whereas the diagonal and horizontal members have angle cross-sections. In order to investigate the effect of the cross-section of elements on the aerodynamic coefficients, an additional model having circular cross-sections for the diagonal and horizontal members was considered. The first wind tunnel test was conducted on the bare models, in the second test the models were equipped with a ladder and feeder cables whereas for the third test both the ladder and cables as well as antennas were installed on the models.

However, EVs arrive at the charging station randomly and connect to the distribution network for fast charging, it causes the grid power to fluctuate greatly and the peak-valley loads to alternate frequently, which is harmful to the stability of distribution network. In order to reduce the power fluctuation of random charging, the energy storage is used for fast charging stations. The queuing model is determined to demonstrate the load characteristics of fast charging station, and the state space of fast charging station system is described by Markov chain. After that the power of grid and energy storage is quantified as the number of charging pile, and each type of power is configured rationally to establish the random charging model of energy storage fast charging station.

Thermal and electromagnetic experiments are carried out to create foundations for transient and steady-state numerical models. A data-driven, deep learning algorithm estimates the core and permanent magnet (PM) eddy current losses in real-time, besides the already available copper and friction losses. Subsequently, a two-node thermal equivalent circuit in a hybrid model with a feed-forward neural network estimates the dynamic temperature profile of windings and PMs. It is indicated that the worst-case estimation error is below 7.5%, and the configuration is applicable under a wide range of operation states and environmental conditions.

Intrusion detection is a classification problem, wherein various Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques applied to classify the network data into normal and attack traffic.

This paper list the different IDS datasets used for the evaluation of IDS model.

However, excessive flooding wastes the limited bandwidth of ad-hoc networks and causes high control overhead. In addition, flooding often causes congestion and collisions. Finding the optimal flooding interval is critical in ODMRP performance. Moreover, there is no such value for flooding interval that is appropriate for all various types of ad-hoc network applications. The present paper aims to reduce the high control overhead that ODMRP suffers from. We propose two schemes to improve this protocol. Both schemes use the link state prediction method that depends on the received signal power strength for predicting the exact link breakage time of an active link before the breakage actually occurs. By using link state prediction, routes are reconstructed only when they will be soon broken, and thus we utilize the bandwidth efficiently and reduce the power consumption when the mobility of nodes is low. The proposed two schemes are ODMRP-GM and ODMRP-LM. In ODMRP-GM, source nodes flood Join Queries only when the topology is changed. In ODMRP-LM, routes are updated locally by the nodes that predict future breakage time of an active route between refresh intervals. The impact of our improvements is evaluated via simulation."}]}]}]}}}

The smart grid is based on combining ICT with the processing capabilities of computers and electrical systems to increase communication between users. However, smart grids are exposed to a variety of malicious cyber-attacks that can lead to the destruction of basic infrastructure and disrupt communication between the grid and users. Meanwhile, by authenticating the authenticated users, cyber-security can be created in the smart grid. One of the main components of a smart power grid is smart meters. However, to maintain security in a communication, smart meter authentication alone is not enough and it must be ensured that the electricity company\u2019s server is not forgery. Therefore, there is a need for two-way authentication between the smart meter on the home side and the electricity company server. The present work provides a key management layout (based on the elliptic curve cryptography) with two-way authentication for communication outside the home area network The proposed solution is two-way authentication among the smart meter and the security associate in the power company. In other words, the proposed methodology creates a solution to establish a connection between valid users and the smart grid. The proposed protocol evaluates the behavior of cyber-attacks on the smart grid. Attacks such as man-in the middle attacks and retransmission attacks are considered. It was found that, the proposed methodology improves the reliance between smart grid and authenticated users with the increase of secure communications.

Contemporary NILM requirements include high-frequency power-line sampling, efficient disaggregation algorithms that can, potentially, run locally, on the monitoring device, to offload the remote fog/cloud infrastructure, and various open datasets to allow the development of such algorithms.

We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies can make this achievable. The number of robots deployed in the manufacturing industry has increased rapidly and this trend is likely to continue in the future, as autonomous robots have the potential to automate a wide array of labor-intensive tasks in the factory environment and improve output. There are many technical challenges that need to be solved to realize an autonomous multifunctional robotic platform. In this research, we aim to address the primary problem of the autonomous navigation of robots in the factory environment. The robotic platform will be able to recognize the markers on the factory floor and navigate in the factory on the designated path by avoiding obstacles in its path from point A to point B autonomously. In this research, we use a minimal number of sensors to reduce the BOM cost of the robotic platform and maximize battery life. We intend to use cameras (RGB), motor encoders and a low-cost IMU to localize the robot, and an electric drive train to propel the platform. Also, we have used neural networks to recognize the markers and paths in the factory environment, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to localize the robot and a navigation algorithm to guide the robotic platform to the destination."}]}]}]}}}

The literature are reviewed to identify gaps in the ILBS development for industrial applications, future research needs to focus a development framework to enable scalable solutions for industry. The key gaps identified in the literature are: (i) a lack of pathways to extend IPS research into an ILBS, (ii) no end-to-end ILBS have been developed and (iii) no framework has been reported that outlines the information pathways from sensor data collection and location information to an established ILBS. The technologies reviewed are presented in a comparison table (Table 1) intended as a reference for selecting technologies for future systems based on requirements.

However, the performance of cloud computing services is hampered due to their inherent vulnerability to failures owing to the scale at which they operate. It is possible to utilize cloud computing services to their maximum potential only if the performance related issues of reliability, availability, and throughput are handled effectively by cloud service providers. Therefore, fault tolerance becomes a critical requirement for achieving high performance in cloud computing. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of fault tolerance-related issues in cloud computing; emphasizing upon the significant concepts, architectural details, and the state-of-art techniques and methods. The objective is to provide insights into the existing fault tolerance approaches as well as challenges yet required to be overcome.

The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides the state-of-the-art review on attacks and threats relevant to the communication layer and presents countermeasures."}]}]}]}}}

Based on the data collected from the workshops, six AR and VR use-cases were defined: stakeholder engagement, design support, design review, construction support, operations and management support, and training. Three main research categories for a future research agenda have been proposed, i.e.: (i) engineering-grade devices, which encompasses research that enables robust devices that can be used in practice, e.g. the rough and complex conditions of construction sites; (ii) workflow and data management; to effectively manage data and processes required by AR and VR technologies; and (iii) new capabilities; which includes new research required that will add new features that are necessary for the specific construction industry demands. This study provides essential information for practitioners to inform adoption decisions. To researchers, it provides a research road map to inform their future research efforts.
