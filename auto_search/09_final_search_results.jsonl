A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes\u2019 preferred parents.

This is made possible by duty-cycling medium access control (MAC) protocols, which allow IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to leave their radios in energy-saving sleep modes most of the time. Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL\u2019s delays by between 33.51% and 39.84%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16% and 2.03% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL\u2019s memory requirements. SMOR\u2019s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55% and 2.74% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks."}]}]}]}}}

From the perspective of communication and data collection, the success rate of collaborations between nodes in mobile ad hoc networks and reliability of data collection mainly depend on whether the nodes in the network operate normally, namely, according to the established network rules. However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed. This protocol has minimal effect on the original communication dynamics and can effectively deal with Packet drop, wormhole, Session hijacking, and other main attacks in MANETs. The NS3 simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol attains good transmission performance, can effectively identify various attacks and bypass malicious nodes, and securely complete the communication process."}]}]}]}}}

Wireless sensor nodes are now used as the foundation for the higher-level industrial internet of things applications. Any type of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) application, as long as the data is collected utilizing the device's sensors. WSN are severely limited in terms of energy. Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09% to 68.13%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23% to 29.12%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33% to 82.38% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, the performance of the recently proposed routing metric Interference Bandwidth Adjusted Expected transmission count (IBETX) metric is compared with two prominent existing metrics, the Expected transmission count (ETX) and the Inverse Expected Transmission count (InvETX) over the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. The performance differentials are analysed using varying packet rates and node densities. From the simulations results, IBETX metric outperforms the ETX and InvETX metric because it implements the bandwidth sharing mechanism and makes use of the information available at the MAC layer.

In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput.

However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %."}]}]}]}}}

The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved."}]}]}]}}}
