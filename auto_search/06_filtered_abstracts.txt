The previous study of static network performance of a Vertical Midimew connected Mesh Network (VMMN) was shown to be good. However, its dynamic communication performance has not been evaluated yet, we have proposed a deadlock free dimension order routing algorithm using 4 virtual channels. In this paper, The TOPAZ simulator is used to evaluate the dynamic communication performance of a VMMN with virtual cut-through flow control under uniform traffic pattern. We found that the VMMN dynamic communication performance is better than that of the hierarchical TESH network and its counter rival MMN.
Graphical abstract                                       Tapered Nonlinear Vibration Energy Harvester(VEH) has been developed.        The nonlinearity substantially widens the hysteresis width to 45 Hz at 1 g excitation.         High power density of up to 2660 μW/cm           is achieved with the nonlinear device.        Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithm suitable for Nonlinear VEHs is presented.        Wireless sensor platform is powered through car vibration with the energy harvester.                The lack of a sustainable power source to substitute batteries for long-term applications limits the widespread deployment of wireless sensor nodes in this era of the Internet of Things. Conventional linear Vibration Energy Harvesters are inefficient in converting ambient mechanical energy into usable electrical energy owing to their narrow frequency bandwidth when harnessing mechanical energy that is spread over a wide range of frequencies. In this work, we design, develop and demonstrate high power density nonlinear wideband energy harvesters using novel tapered spring architectures in an autonomous wireless sensor node system. These spring structures exhibit a nonlinear restoring force arising from the atypical stress distribution that can be additionally tuned by changing the taper-ratio in the structure. We investigate different tapering designs in order to achieve optimal spring hardening nonlinearities. This nonlinearity aids in widening the operable bandwidth, making the harvesters suitable for scavenging energy from real-world broadband vibrations. We obtain power densities of the order of 2660 μW/cm           in the nonlinear energy harvester, outpacing most contemporary energy scavengers. We present a modified Perturb and Observe algorithm that allows tracing of the maximum power point in the context of non-stationary vibration conditions. We use the fabricated nonlinear device to power a wireless sensor node that reports on vital physical parameters (humidity, temperature), thereby enabling a resilient remote data acquisition system. This demonstrates the potential of our design to provide a sustainable energy source for platforms within the Internet of Things.
The technology-driven application of big data is expected to assist policymaking towards sustainable development; however, the relevant literature has not addressed human welfare under climate change, which limits the understanding of climate change impacts on human societies. We present the first application of unique mobile phone network data to evaluate the current nation-wide human welfare of coastal tourism at Japanese beaches and project the value change using the four climate change scenarios. The results show that the projected national economic value loss rates are more significant than the projected national physical beach loss rates. Our findings demonstrate regional differences in recreational values: most southern beaches with larger current values would disappear, while the current small values of the northern beaches would remain. These changes imply that the ranks of the beaches, based on economic values, would enable policymakers to discuss management priorities under climate change.       Graphical abstract             Image 1                               Big data application is an emerging field in tourism.        Mobile phone network data reveals coastal tourism value across Japan.        The approach projects spatial-seasonal gradients of the values under climate change.        Changes in beach ranks based on the values enable to discuss policy priorities.        This unique approach applies to a wide variety of climate-vulnerable services.
The network is an arrangement where minimum of two nodes are connected and communicated via different independent paths. The swift expansion of communication network causes the problem of reliability in the computer network. Reliability is the capacity of a system to do an ideal task, such as communication. In network communication, designing and consistency of a network are used to identify QOS, as the networks are becoming more wide and complex. The previous research in areas of wired reliability is not competent to deal with issues of the wireless network. There are several strategies helps us to increase the reliability of the network. The exact calculation of reliability in the network is calculated by our new algorithm and effective solution can be attained by using the artificial neural network (ANN). This paper more concentrates on reliability calculation with network flexibility.
Although several analytical models have been proposed in the literature for different interconnection networks with different routing algorithms, there is only one work [M. Ould-Khaoua, An approximate performance model for partially adaptive routing algorithm in hypercubes, Microprocessors and Microsystems 23 (1999) 185–190] dealing with partially adaptive routing. It is not accurate enough especially in heavy traffic regions due to the rough approximation of assuming equal traffic rate over network channels. We show, however, such an approximation can greatly affect the accuracy of the model. This paper proposes an accurate analytical model to predict the average message latency in wormhole hypercube networks using partially adaptive routing. Our model accurately formulates the traffic rate over individual network channels and the results obtained from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a significant accuracy for various network sizes and under different operating conditions even in moderate to heavy traffic regions, the regions for which the model in [M. Ould-Khaoua, An approximate performance model for partially adaptive routing algorithm in hypercubes, Microprocessors and Microsystems 23 (1999) 185–190] fails to exhibit acceptable accuracy.
Graphical abstract                                       A class of stretchable microstrip antennas is designed with serpentine mesh layouts using a set of non-dimensional parameters.        Non-dimensional parameters can tune the coupled mechanical-electromagnetic properties of stretchable microstrip antennas at various tensile strain levels.        The advanced laser micromachining technology can efficiently and precisely fabricate stretchable microstrip antennas from conventional metals at a low cost.        The demonstrated toolkit on coupled mechanics-electromagnetics can also be applied to the other stretchable microwave devices.               With the rapid development of flexible/stretchable electronics, wireless technology for wearable systems starts to gain momentum. Here, a class of stretchable microstrip antennas composed of serpentine mesh layouts in both the patch and ground plane is designed. The study of the representative stretchable microstrip antenna reveals the effects of the geometric parameters on its electromagnetic properties. Although the non-dimensional parameters have been shown to uniquely determine the mechanical properties of the serpentine mesh structure, their influence on the coupled mechanical-electromagnetic properties is different in the stretchable antenna. This study systematically reveals the effects of the non-dimensional parameters at various tensile strain levels from the coupled mechanics-electromagnetics simulations, with experimental validations. The mechanical stretchability of the serpentine mesh structure increases as the arc angle increases or the normalized width (i.e., the ratio of the width to radius) decreases. The normalized width together with the change in radius and width provides an effective means to tune the initial resonance frequency, impedance matching, and radiation pattern of the stretchable antenna without altering the strain sensitivity. Additionally, the advanced laser micromachining technology for the manufacturing of the stretchable microstrip antenna can also be explored to the other stretchable microwave devices.
Digital twin (DT) has been moving progressively from concept to practice for bridge operation and maintenance (O&M), but its issues of data synchronization and fault tolerance remain problematic. This paper investigates the time delay of bridge DT services according to communication and computation complexity, revealing the distinct impact of their sequence, and proposes an AIoT-informed DT communication framework to solve the above issues. The information hierarchy and two-way communication can be leveraged to minimize communication complexity in the framework. Meanwhile, the data flow and resilience of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a Petri net. Moreover, the framework is developed into a prototypical DT through cross-platform integration and validated with different cases. The results demonstrate that compared with other existing bridge DTs, the proposed framework has high efficiency, low-latency, and excellent fault tolerance, which can contribute to the efficiency and safety of bridge O&M, especially under communication-constraint circumstances. The framework is also promising for federated learning to protect the AI-model privacy of different stakeholders and has the potential to support agent-based intelligent bridge management in the future with little human intervention.                        An AIoT-informed DT communication framework is proposed to support smart bridge O&M with high efficiency, low latency, and excellent fault tolerance to endure a temporary loss of communication, as well as developed into a cross-platform prototype, which is validated through different cases.        The time delay of bridge DT services is studied in this paper, revealing the significant impact of communicaiton complexity, as well as how to minimize it through information hierarchy and two-way communcation.        The bridge DT is idealized in state-space representation with time delay. Moreover, the data flow and resilience of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a Petri net with tokens and conditional probability respectively.
Modern vehicles contain various security systems including vehicular networking where vehicles receive relevant traffic information using wireless communications from their peers. This wireless communication is mediated by the radiofrequency electromagnetic field. Exposure to electromagnetic fields caused by the transportation system is a cause of concern for many people. Plenty of dosimetric analysis of electromagnetic field carried out by various research groups found out the highest exposure values in the transport. How long-term effects of these fields affect the human organism and what is the mechanism of action, are questions without known answers. Several studies point to the possible association of different diseases with electromagnetic field exposure. The key to understanding the effect of the electromagnetic field on the human organism is to reveal the mechanism of action of these fields.
This work proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to increase the measurement precision of multi-sensors data fusion in the Internet of Things (IOT) system. Critical IOT technologies consist of a wireless sensor network, RFID, various sensors and an embedded system. For multi-sensor data fusion computing systems, data aggregation is a main concern and can be formulated as a multiple dimensional based on particle swarm optimization approaches. The proposed improved PSO method can locate the minimizing solution to the objective cost function in multiple dimensional assignment themes, which are considered in particle swarm initiation, cross rules and mutation rules. The optimum seclusion can be searched for efficiently with respect to reducing the search range through validated candidate measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved PSO method for multi-sensor data fusion is highly feasible for IOT system applications.
In an optical mesh network operation, lightpaths are setup when requested, without prior knowledge of future requests. The concerns of increasing the sharing of backup paths and reducing capacity consumption are addressed on a best-of-now basis. As the number of lightpaths increases, it is possible to reroute existing paths to increase sharing further and free up more network capacity. This paper proposes several rerouting algorithms and compares their performance on test networks. All the described algorithms reroute the backup paths only and do not affect ongoing service. Also, the effect of network load factor and the number of lightpaths on the rerouting gain is examined.
Device-free localization and tracking as an emerging technology has attracted substantial research attention in wireless sensor networks. However, there is much room for improvement in localization and tracking accuracy. In this paper, by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements we propose an enhanced geometric filter which consists of a series of weights corresponding to RSS, distance, and angle, respectively. Specifically, RSS-based weights are dependent on the change in RSS of communication links to remove improbable target locations. To ensure robust tracking performance, distance-based weights are assigned to probable target locations. Angle-based weights are used to ensure the correct direction of motion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed geometric filter could improve the accuracy of positioning by up to 50.8% for non-straight path and 48.3% for straight path over some state-of-the-art methods.
Several technologies provide cellular connectivity to transmit data to end devices (EDs) in the indoor environment. These technologies have short-range; complex network architecture; short lifespan; and high power consumption. In this paper, LoRa is utilized to design the Building Internet of Things (BIoT) system for electronic shelf labels (ESL) to provide long-range connectivity. To minify the transmission losses, the concurrent data exploits data parallelism for updating transmission parameters at the network server (NS) for non-interruptive communication between the centroid gateways (GWs) and allocated EDs. The EDs are deployed by K-means at different locations in each cluster based on spreading factor (SF) and data rate (DR) to avoid data congestion and intra-SF interference for the SF and hybrid (DR/SF) models. The varying bandwidths (BWs) and duty cycles (DCs) enhance the lifespan of the EDs, while the Bayesian game parameter selection (BGPS) method minimizes the power losses among the EDs. The one-slope estimates medium losses; the adjusted R-square predicts variance; and Pearson finds a correlation among the measured values. The hybrid model improves the network’s performance to a spiraling average efficiency of 90.48 % and 89.64 %, with network saturation of 10.185 % and 10.337 % for pure and slotted ALOHA, respectively. The overall results illustrate a packet loss ratio (PLR) of 20.11 % for the SF model and 4.861 % for the hybrid model. The energy dissipation plunged to 0.06032 J per day, prolonging the EDs’ life span to 14265.34 days.
Cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) are growing at an alarming rate as IoT technologies are literally connecting everything into networks. In 2020 more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the IoT. Hence, it is very important to treat IoT security as a mandatory design factor. Moreover the deployed IoT system should be continuously monitored to detect malicious behaviour such as packet dropping, worm propagation or jammer attacks. In the paper we propose the anomaly based Intrusion Detection System dedicated to Bluetooth Mesh networks. The machine learning algorithm is used to classify traffic and detect malicious behaviour in IoT networks. The proposed solution involve cooperative decision making which is done by multiple watchdogs distributed in different regions of the considered network – which are responsible for processing of mostly local traffic. The optimal placement of watchdogs is proposed based on simulations done by      software. The experimental results coming from our testbed confirm that the watchdog placement proposed by simulator allow on effective detection of real-world intrusions.

Moreover, this paper improves the estimation algorithm of students' specific location and direction on campus, and analyzes the network structure of the smart teaching system based on the actual needs of smart teaching, and builds a three-tier teaching structure system. In addition, on the basis of demand analysis, this paper sets the system function modules, analyzes the data processing effect of the network nodes of this smart campus through experimental research, and evaluates the system teaching effect. Finally, this paper uses simulation technology to analyze 100 sets of data to evaluate the data processing effect of ZigBee network. Through the experimental research results, we can see that the smart campus teaching system constructed in this paper has good results.
Energy efficiency is a must in today HPC systems. To achieve this goal, a holistic design based on the use of power-aware components should be performed. One of the key components of an HPC system is the high-speed interconnect. In this paper, we compare and evaluate several design options for the interconnection network of an HPC system, including torus, fat-trees and dragonflies. State of the art low power modes are also used in the interconnection networks. The paper does not only consider energy efficiency at the interconnection network level but also at the system as a whole.    The analysis is performed by using a simple yet realistic power model of the system. The model has been adjusted using actual power consumption values measured on a real system. Using this model, realistic multi-job trace-based workloads have been used, obtaining the execution time and energy consumed. The results are presented to ease choosing a system, depending on which parameter, performance or energy consumption, receives the most importance.                       Measurements in modern HPC hardware have been taken to fix the model parameters.        Torus topology shows the best trade-off between energy and runtime.        Fat-tree shows good energy efficiency under low traffic loads.        Fat-tree shows the worst energy efficiency under high loads.        Dragonfly topology energy efficiency is close to the torus topology.        Power saving strategies reduce energy with negligible performance overhead.        Using aggressive Power-Down Threshold greatly worsens the dragonfly performance.
Graphical abstract                                    The all-IP WSN architecture based on gateway trees is proposed.        The proposed routing algorithm is achieved in the link layer without route discovery.        A mobile node does not need to be configured with a care-of address.        A physician can monitor the vital signs of a patient at any time and at any places.               This paper proposes the all-IP WSNs (wireless sensor networks) for real-time patient monitoring. In this paper, the all-IP WSN architecture based on gateway trees is proposed and the hierarchical address structure is presented. Based on this architecture, the all-IP WSN can perform routing without route discovery. Moreover, a mobile node is always identified by a home address and it does not need to be configured with a care-of address during the mobility process, so the communication disruption caused by the address change is avoided. Through the proposed scheme, a physician can monitor the vital signs of a patient at any time and at any places, and according to the IPv6 address he can also obtain the location information of the patient in order to perform effective and timely treatment. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated based on the simulation, and the simulation data indicate that the proposed scheme might effectively reduce the communication delay and control cost, and lower the packet loss rate.
Aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent antibiotics exerting a bactericidal effect when concentrations at the site of infection are equal to or greater than 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). When administered intravenously, they exhibit poor lung penetration and high systemic renal and ototoxicity, imposing to restrict their administration to 5 days. Experimental studies conducted in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep and pigs provide evidence that high doses of nebulized aminoglycosides induce a rapid and potent bacterial killing in the infected lung parenchyma. They also confirm that the alveolar-capillary membrane, either normal or injured by the infectious process, restricts the penetration of intravenous aminoglycosides in the infected lung parenchyma, precluding a bactericidal effect at the site of infection. However, injury of the alveolar-capillary membrane promotes the systemic diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides. Based on experimental data obtained in animals with inoculation pneumonia, it challenges the classical belief that nebulization protects against systemic toxicity. Loss of lung aeration decreases the lung penetration of nebulized aminoglycosides. Nevertheless, lung tissue concentrations measured in non-aerated lung regions with severe and extended pneumonia are most often greater than 5 times the MICs, resulting in a bactericidal effect followed by a progressive pulmonary reaeration. It is likely that the penetration into the consolidated lung, results from the bronchial diffusion of nebulized aminoglycosides toward adjacent non-aerated infected alveolar spaces and their penetration into mechanical ventilation-induced intraparenchymal pseudocysts and distended bronchioles. In animals receiving nebulized aminoglycosides, epithelial lining fluid concentrations grossly overestimate lung interstitial fluid concentrations because of the bronchial contamination of the distal tip of the bronchoscope during the bronchoalveolar procedures. Lung microdialysis is the only technique able to accurately assess lung pharmacokinetics in animals with inoculation pneumonia treated by nebulized aminoglycosides. In 2024, the European Investigators Network for Nebulized Antibiotics in Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (ENAVAP) called for the creation of an international research network for Lung Microdialysis applied to Nebulized Antibiotics (LUMINA) to promote multicentered, experimental, randomized, and controlled studies addressing lung pharmacokinetics of intravenous vs. nebulized antibiotics, using different dosing and ventilator settings.
Agriculture is the backbone of the country. Half of the world population depends on agriculture and agriculture based products. Growth of the agriculture is mainly affected by the intruders. Detecting intruders in agriculture is a challenging task. Effective intruder detection module requires performance analysis and improvisation. Agriculture intrusion detection model starts with the selection of the suitable topology. Internet of Things (IoT) module mainly relies on the data transmission and reception from sensors which are logically arranged in the farm field. Agriculture Intrusion Detection System can be used with wireless sensors in order to detect the intruders in the agriculture field and sends an alert message to the user which exchange information among internet connected devices based on the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Main objective is to identify the suitable topology for the transmission of Data from various sensor nodes. Nodes are placed in the field at various topologies like star topology, Bus topology, P2P Topology, Mesh Topology. Performance of the various topologies is measured and compared by analysing metrics like Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, Noise Ratio, Power Factor and Packet Loss. Result shows that the Mesh topology outperforms other topologies.
Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives lifestyle changes in smart city infrastructure due to rapid growth of services and activities that develop well-being. One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.
One of the main factors that disrupt reliability and stop energy provision is the fault occurrence in distribution networks. Thus, accurate and fast fault prediction and location in distribution networks are essential for increasing reliability, fast restoration, optimal electrical energy consumption, and customer satisfaction. This study reviews and investigates fault prediction and fault location topics. To this end, the existing methods and views in the context of fault prediction are reviewed first; then, fault location is investigated. This paper investigates various methods, their advantages, disadvantages, technical reports, and patents in conventional distribution networks, smart-grids, and micro-grids. Comparison of this study with other surveys indicates that it is more comprehensive and despite others covers fault prediction. In addition, it includes an up to date review of the methods for distance measurement and fault location considering different network types (AC/DC), presence of DG, communication and automation standards, synchronous and unsynchronous measurement, magnetic measurement, and state estimation-based fault location methods.
Extreme events are greatly impacting the normal operations of microgrids, which can lead to severe outages and affect the continuous supply of energy to customers, incurring substantial restoration costs. Repair crews (RCs) are regarded as crucial resources to provide system resilience owing to their mobility and flexibility characteristics in handling both transportation and energy systems. Nevertheless, effectively coordinating the dispatch of RCs towards system resilience is a complex decision-making problem, especially in the context of a multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) with enormous dynamics and uncertainties. To this end, this paper formulates the dispatch problem of RCs in a coupled transportation and power-gas network as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is proposed by featuring a two-level framework, where the high-level action is used for switching decision-making between transportation and power-gas networks, and the lower-level action constructed via the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is used to compute the routing and repairing decisions of RCs in the transportation and power-gas networks, respectively. The proposed algorithm also introduces an abstracted critic network by integrating the load restoration status, which captures the system dynamics and stabilizes the training performance with privacy protection. Extensive case studies are evaluated on a coupled 6-bus power and 6-bus gas network integrated with a 9-node 12-edge transportation network. The proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional MARL algorithms in terms of policy quality, learning stability, and computational performance. Furthermore, the dispatch strategies of RCs are analyzed and their corresponding benefits for load restoration are also evaluated. Finally, the scalability of the proposed method is also investigated for a larger 33-bus power and 15-bus gas network integrated with an 18-node 27-edge transportation network.                       Dispatch of repair crews is formulated as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.        A hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed.        Coupled transportation, power, and gas networks are captured.        Uncertain nature of renewable resources, demand, and traffic volumes is considered.        Repair crews are efficient to provide system resilience and reduce essential load shedding.
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an innovative paradigm for the future internet architecture, which addresses IP network limitations in supporting content distribution and information access by decoupling content from hosts and providing the ability to retrieve a content object by its name (identifier), rather than its storage location (IP address). Name resolution and routing is critical for content retrieval in ICN networks. In this research, we perform a comparative study of two widely used classes of ICN name resolution and routing schemes, namely flooding and Distributed Hash Table (DHT). We consider the flooding-based routing in Content-Centric Networks due to its wide acceptance. For the DHT scheme, we design a multi-level DHT that takes into account the underlying network topology and uses name aggregation to further reduce control overhead and improve network efficiency. Then, we compare the characteristics and performance of these two classes of name resolution and routing through extensive simulations. The evaluation results show that the performances of these two approaches are reliant on several factors, including network size, content location dynamics, and content popularity. Our study reveals insights into the design tradeoffs and offers guidelines for design strategies.
The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh profile, standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), has an increasing interest in IoT solutions. However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %.
Comprehensive review of more than 200 papers published between 2010 and 2019.        Examined the approaches conducted to enhance the resilience of power systems.        Used deductive methodology to identify gaps in the literature on integration.        Meta-heuristic shows vacuum includes limited degradation and self-restoration analysis.        Models for a smarter, cleaner and more resilient systems are required.              This paper presents a survey of the literature on the strategies to enhance the resilience of power systems while shedding lights on the research gaps. Using a deductive methodology on the literature covering the resilience of power systems, we reviewed more than two hundred peer-reviewed articles spanning the 2010–2019 decade. We find that there is vacuum on the level of integration that considers the interdependence of local or decentralized decision making in an adaptive power system. This gap is widened by the absence of policies to enhance resilience in power networks. While there is significant coverage and convergence of research on algorithms for solving the multi-objective problem in optimization routines, there are still uncharted territories on how to incorporate system degradation while designing these self-restoration systems. We posit that a shift to a smarter, cleaner and more resilient power network requires sustained investments rather than disaster-induced responses.
Quality of group communication using mobile ad-hoc networks depends on various factors like channel fading, signal quality, path loss, transmission and reception power of mobile nodes, mobility, link life and battery backup. Different layers are involved in communication, but the behavior of these layers is isolated with each other and overall network performance may effect from their operations. A cross-layer approach can extract the critical information from multiple layers which can be further utilized to enhance the overall network performance and Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, Cross-layer Multicast Routing (CLMR) is introduced to enhance the QoS using a tree-based multicast routing protocol. In order to achieve QoS, optimization of the tree operations and tree management cost has been done. CLMR exploits the functionality of PHY layer, Application layer and Routing Layer for QoS oriented communication. Performance of CLMR is analyzed using Multicast Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (MAODV) routing protocol under various parameters, i.e. Throughput, Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio, Link Cost and Energy Consumption.
This paper introduces an improvement for Hybrid Energy Aware and SLA Based (EASB) routing mechanism enabled for GMPLS networks. The performance of EASB is enhanced significantly by consulting a routing table populated in advance, instead of route calculation for each connection request. The table is “looked up” to determine the route that has the minimum hybrid cost for the given source-destination pair of the connection request. As a result a node with lower compute capability can be used to server the equal amount of connection requests while maintaining emission and resource efficiency.
Patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction are often unable to sense urine volume. Implantable sensors are used to monitor bladder urine volume. Securing sensors to the bladder involves sutures or synthetic adhesives that are invasive to it. Inspired by the safety harness that can be attached to objects by straps, we propose the bladder electronic harness (E-harness) for urine volume monitoring. The E-harness is a non-stick 2-dimensional structure that can be wrapped around the bladder without harming it. It is also soft enough to put no extra pressure on the bladder when it expands. Integrated with soft strain sensors and a wireless system, the E-harness can conform to the bladder, can measure bladder liquid volume with high accuracy (∼0.16 mL), and does not fall off for 1 month. The size of the E-harness is easily adjustable and can be used on small animals such as mice and large animals such as pigs.       Graphical abstract                                      Conformal attachment to the bladder without using sutures and adhesives        Originating from 2D soft, thin film that can be fabricated easily        Reading urine volume wirelessly via NFC with a resolution of ∼0.16 mL           Inspired by the safety harness that can be attached to objects by straps, Shen et al. propose the bladder electronic harness for urine volume monitoring. It can be wrapped around the bladder and customized according to demand. This provides a potential solution for patients with urine volume perception disorder to sense urine storage.
The purpose of a vehicular network is to provide better safety and infotainment services to the users through an effective communication. To attain this, IEEE802.11p standard is developed with Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) contention-based priority-oriented medium access method. In this method, the backoff algorithm selects the Contention Window (CW) size randomly from the range (0, CW). The lower bound for this range is always fixed as zero, irrespective of the backoff stages and congestion in the network. This causes the backoff procedure to select the smaller value even when the network is heavily congested thus increasing collisions and congestion. To resolve this unbalanced backoff interval problem, this paper proposes a Channel Status based Contention Algorithm (CSCA) which regulates the backoff interval based on the number of retransmission attempts by packets and vehicle density for the non-safety applications. The network simulation is carried out using NS3 along with SUMO for highway traffic and results are shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the default EDCA and Adaptive EDCA (A-EDCA) methods in terms of packet collision rate, throughput and delay.
In this paper the computational complexity of finding packet routing schemes provably efficient with respect to the end-to-end delay is studied. The attention is focused on polynomial-time algorithms able to optimize the end-to-end delay when the number of packets in the network increases, and the number of packets that can be accepted in the network in order to keep the end-to-end delay within a constant value. In particular, the hardness of approximating in polynomial time both the minimum end-to-end delay and the maximum number of accepted packets within any sublinear error in the number of packets is proved.
Wireless passive sensors, being battery-free and simple, are suitable for disposable use across various applications, from tracking food and monitoring the environment to clinical diagnostics. However, their utilization is hampered by the complexity of existing readout techniques and the absence of memory functionality within the sensor. Here, we present a reader technique that can automatically lock to the sensor value wirelessly through inductive coupling, significantly reducing the reader complexity. By integrating a high-frequency audio link and wireless powering, we demonstrate a battery-free and flexible reader. We integrated this reader for wireless temperature logging, which logs temperature data based on the irreversible geometric change of low-melting-point metal during phase transitions, resulting in non-volatile resistance change. As a whole, these results establish the feasibility of a simplistic reader and a passive non-volatile thermistor sensor, opening up new possibilities for disposable and ubiquitous temperature monitoring as well as a range of other applications.

Ideally, a sensor should be capable of measuring non-transient data, a challenge given their minimalistic design. Additionally, an equally minimalistic reader is needed to facilitate everyday applications. In this context, we introduce a reader that operates through self-oscillation, enabling a flexible, sticker-like reader that is compatible with smartphone NFC technology. The potential for this reader to function with any passive sensor would be of interest to the broader device community. The sensor employs an irreversible phase transition to record non-transient data, demonstrated here through the measurement of the temperature abuse history of food. By addressing the challenge of creating a simple reader and sensor with memory functionality, we have taken a significant step forward in the development of passive wireless sensor-reader systems.           A simple and user-friendly wireless reader that can replace current bulky devices for passive sensors is crucial for ubiquitous sensing. This study explores the potential of creating a flexible and battery-less wireless reader using weakly nonlinear coupling theory. This minimalist reader, when paired with a passive temperature sensor featuring memory functionality, enhances the usability and accessibility of temperature history tracking.
The management of hydrographical systems is still mainly based on the expertise of the managers. Although this expertise enables the efficient management of these networks under normal conditions, modifications due to human activities or climate change could lead them to manage situations that were not known until now. In addition, advances in Automation, Computing Science and Artificial Intelligence provide tools and methods to assist the managers. In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal. It is used to play-back past scenarios allowing feedback of applied management strategies and fast simulations with predictive and adaptive management strategies to determine their performances and giving decision aid criteria for the managers. The objective of the presented paper is to define the framework for a digital twin of the Canal of Calais.
Latency on Internet mainly depends on the distance that packets travel in WAN networks     . This latency can be reduced if the hops between autonomous systems are reduced. This is the main function of the BGP protocol that is used by default in all the ISPs, but the lack of announcement of some network segments causes some routes to increase. This paper proposes a simple method to detect the routes that can be optimized and also a method using SDN to correct them.    The first step is to determine which routes can be optimized, that is, those that are sent to a neighbor when they travel the greater distance, although this can not be determined by the router since it does not analyze all the routes that BGP receives in context. The second step is to add the new routes to the router, also by BGP, so that the router uses them.
With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming part of our daily life and our environment, we expect rapid growth in the number of connected devices. IoT is expected to connect billions of devices and humans to bring promising advantages for us. With this growth, fog computing, along with its related edge computing paradigms, such as multi-access edge computing (MEC) and cloudlet, are seen as promising solutions for handling the large volume of security-critical and time-sensitive data that is being produced by the IoT. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial on fog computing and its related computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Next, we provide a taxonomy of research topics in fog computing, and through a comprehensive survey, we summarize and categorize the efforts on fog computing and its related computing paradigms. Finally, we provide challenges and future directions for research in fog computing.
Vulnerability analysis is crucial in strategic planning and highway maintenance to ensure a robust transportation system. Owing to the characteristics of network-modeling framework, traditional vulnerability analyses may not be able to realistically model the impacts of network degradations. This paper presents an application of the continuum traffic equilibrium model for network vulnerability analysis that aims to resolve the critical issues faced by the network-modeling framework. The continuum traffic equilibrium model treats the road system as a continuum over which the demands are continuously dispersed. In this study, a bi-level model is set up for finding the most vulnerable location(s) in the study region. At the lower-level model, a set of differential equations is constructed to describe the traffic equilibrium problem under capacity degradation. In the upper-level model, a constrained minimization problem is set up to find the most vulnerable location(s) that minimizes the accessibility index of the study region. A sensitivity-based solution algorithm that adopts the finite element method (FEM) is proposed to solve the bi-level model. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed continuum vulnerability analysis and the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm.
As the electrification of the transportation industry and growing adoption of these electric vehicles continues, the demand for charging infrastructure is increasing concurrently. Properly deploying this infrastructure requires that there exist models which can adequately estimate the performance of these vehicles under real scenarios. While there has been significant work on estimating energy-consumption for realistic drive profiles, there is a need to systematically incorporate the conditions (e.g. wind, elevation) along a route for enabling efficient charger deployment. In this work, we have developed a software package known as INCEPTS, an agent-based simulation software that can predict high-fidelity electric vehicle performance and can capture the dynamics exhibited by the individual vehicles as they travel on their respective routes. The software then uses this to analyze fleets of vehicles which will provide the fleet performance statistics that result from various impacts exhibited by the fleet in the simulated area. These statistics can then be further used to inform decisions such as charger deployment to ensure that the placement of chargers adapts to the local needs of the electric vehicle fleet. Furthermore, this software is developed such that it is capable of simulating different kinds of electric vehicles (e.g. cars, trucks, eVTOLs) and different locations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the software, a variety of simulations are performed using Massachusetts as a target location. The first set of simulations show the importance of accounting for local conditions of individual vehicles. For example, the difference is state-of-charge could differ by up to 30% for the same distance traveled. The second set of simulations looked at the fleet performance within Massachusetts in which a bimodality of energy used per mile is observed, with means at 184 Wh/mi and 244 Wh/mi. Our work demonstrated that this bimodality results from a combination of both local conditions and geometric restrictions caused by the road network. These results are indicative of the unique capabilities of the INCEPTS platform and we plan to demonstrate additional use-cases in follow-up studies.

The design of an efficient and scalable Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to accommodate the fluctuations in topology, node-mobility, node-density, and network-size is an exigent task. A meticulous investigation is necessitated to implement the sensor nodes in an appropriate topology at optimum node-mobility in ZigBee incorporated WSN networks to offer optimum Quality of Services (QoS). Subsequently, an attempt to compute the comprehensive recital of a non-beacon mode based 802.15.4/ZigBee integrated WSN network is demonstrated. An analytical model is designed using parameters such as back-off number, retransmission limit, and back-off exponent considering the impact of node-mobility which has not reported earlier. Further, the investigation is carried out experimentally by evaluating the different QoS metrics, for instance, throughput, network load, bit error rate (BER), received power, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and end-to-end delay for diverse node-density and network-size of a mobile Wireless Sensor Network. Based on the measurements obtained, the authors recommend implementing the mobile sensor nodes in a cluster-tree fashion to afford the best possible QoS services.
The millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communication with the advantages of abundant bandwidth and immunity to interference has been deemed a promising technology to greatly improve network capacity. However, due to such characteristics of mmWave, as short transmission distance, high sensitivity to the blockage, and large propagation path loss, handover issues (including trigger condition and target beam selection) become much complicated. In this paper, we design a novel handover scheme to optimize the overall system throughput as well as the total system delay while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) of each User Equipment (UE). Specifically, the proposed handover scheme called O-MAPPO integrates the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm and optimization theory. The RL algorithm known as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) plays a role in determining handover trigger conditions. Further, we propose an optimization problem in conjunction with MAPPO to select the target base station. The aim is to evaluate and optimize the system performance of total throughput and delay while guaranteeing the QoS of each UE after the handover decision is made. The numerical results show the overall system throughput and delay with our method are slightly worse than that with the exhaustive search method but much better than that using another typical RL algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).
In on-device training of machine learning models on microcontrollers a neural network is trained on the device. A specific approach for collaborative on-device training is federated learning. In this paper, we propose embedded federated learning on microcontroller boards using the communication capacity of a LoRa mesh network. We apply a dual board design: The machine learning application that contains a neural network is trained for a keyword spotting task on the Arduino Portenta H7. For the networking of the federated learning process, the Portenta is connected to a TTGO LORA32 board that operates as a router within a LoRa mesh network. We experiment the federated learning application on the LoRa mesh network and analyze the network, system, and application level performance. The results from our experimentation suggest the feasibility of the proposed system and exemplify an implementation of a distributed application with re-trainable compute nodes, interconnected over LoRa, entirely deployed at the tiny edge.
This paper describes an energy-aware, airborne, dynamic data-driven application systems for persistent sensing in complex atmospheric conditions. The work combines i.) new onboard and remote real-time, wind sensing capabilities; ii.) online models for planning based on Gaussian processes for onboard data and dynamic atmospheric models that assimilate Doppler radar data; and iii.) a hierarchical guidance and control framework with algorithms that can adapt to environmental, sensing, and computational resources. The novel aspects of this work include real-time synthesis of multiple Doppler radar data into wind field measurements; creation of atmospheric models for online planning that can be run inside guidance loops; guidance algorithms based on stochastic dynamic programming and ordered upwind methods that can adapt planning horizons, cost function approximations, and mesh representations of the environment; and throttling algorithms that manage the adaptation of the models and guidance algorithms in response to computational resources.
Scalable Video adaptation is process of extracting the scalable video levels, which can be realized by technologies such as Software Defined Network and Content Aware Network, where devices are capable of processing packets based on the content that flows through them. The main challenge involved in the adaptation process is building the prior knowledge required for deciding the number of scalable layers. This paper implements Scalable Video streaming over a Software Defined Network. From this work, we derive the prior knowledge required by the controller to identify the adaptation parameters for different network conditions and video types.
Smart grid applications requires network availability with lesser dark spots. The available qualitative requirements with dynamic nodes, static stations and routers need to be validated without collisions. This can reach to back-haul network with reachability of specific nodes and routers in Wireless Sensor Network. One method of solving the issue is to use local automate based environment for dynamic nodes. Advanced with static environment configuring address agnostic feature could bridge the gap between static and dynamic environments. The multicast probabilistic model using LA-ANA is proposed with quantified metrics in MAC layer to avoid congestion and dark spots in Wireless Sensor Networks. Thus, increasing throughput and fault tolerance levels with 10-15% supporting unicast and multicast delivery.
With the ever-increasing wireless data application recently, considerable efforts have been focused on the design of distributed explicit rate scheme based on Network Utility Maximization (NUM) or wireless multi-hop mesh networks. This paper describes a novel wireless multi-hop multicast flow control scheme for wireless mesh networks via 802.11, which is based on the distributed self-turning Optimal Proportional plus Second-order Differential (OPSD) controller. The control scheme, which is located at the sources in the wireless multicast networks, can ensure short convergence time by regulating the transmission rate. We further analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of fast response time, low packet loss and error ration.
IEEE 802.16 standard has been proposed to support wide-range wireless broadband access. It is based on a common medium access control (MAC) protocol compliance with several physical layer specifications and operates in two modes Point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh mode. Physical layer specifications and MAC protocol signaling are already well defined for the standard. But, scheduling policies for IEEE 802.16 have been left as open issue to be explored by equipment manufactures. The objective of this survey is to investigate scheduling issues to ensure quality of service (QoS) support for WiMAX networks. Design issues for the development of schedulers have been presented. Classification and characteristics of various techniques based on their fundamental working principle are considered and summarized. Impact-able future issues in the area of QoS support for WiMAX have also been discussed.
In the recent trends, Wireless Mesh networks are proven to be one of the emerging fields in the wireless networks. WMNs comprises of Gateways (GWs), Mesh Clients (MCs) and Mesh Routers (MRs). However, it is challenging job to provide seamless connectivity when MC moves around the network. The recent advances in the field of wireless technology created a chance to overwhelmed the disadvantages of wired and wireless networks. The mobility management in the WMNs motivated the researchers to concentrate. In this paper, we are proposing a model called as multi-layer routing protocol for WMNs. This protocol works with the data link layer and network layer for data frame transmission. The proposed algorithm is implemented with intra domain for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the routing protocol.
To optimize performance of ad hoc networks, the contradicting objectives: energy conservation and high data rate realization need to be jointly considered. In such a case, network interference need to be controlled in a manner that users transmit at minimum power enough to sustain the transmission. This paper proposes a joint power and rate adaptation in ad hoc network based on coupled interference minimization (PRIM) where the formulated network utility maximization (NUM) is solved using reverse engineering based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In that way, users determine their transmit power and data rate based on their local observations (coupled interference). Pricing mechanism is employed in PRIM to restrict users from self-interest behaviours. It is demonstrated theoretically that PRIM satisfies the conditions of the super-modular games such that the local optimality is always the global optimality. Simulation results have shown that adapting transmits power and data rates based on the coupled interference (i.e. link dynamics) can improve the performance of ad hoc networks.
The deployment strategy of wireless applications in metropolitan areas is essential for their efficiency and functionality. In this paper, we introduce and study a deployment strategy for wireless on-street parking sensor networks. We define a multiple-objective problem in our analysis, and solve it with two real-world street parking maps. We present the results on the trade-off among minimum energy consumption, sensing information delay and the amount of deployed mesh routers and Internet gateways, i.e., the cost of city infrastructure. These results yield engineering insights for appraising and deploying city mesh infrastructure to provide smart parking services to urban users. We also analyze these trade-offs to see how different urban layouts affect the optimal solutions.
The efficient and timely execution of tasks is a fundamental challenge in the realm of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address this challenge, fog devices are often deployed close to end devices to facilitate task processing on behalf of IoT nodes. One strategy for improving task computational delay is to employ parallel task offloading, in which tasks are subdivided into subtasks and sent to different fog devices for execution in parallel. However, allocating computational resources to fog nodes and mapping these resources to IoT subtasks is a key challenge in this area. This work models the parallel task offloading problem as a graph-matching problem and utilizes a many-to-many matching technique to achieve a stable mapping of IoT subtasks to fog node resources. Unfortunately, the proposed solution is subject to the problem of externalities due to the dynamic preference profiling of fog nodes. To address this issue, we employ an iterative algorithm to resolve any blocking pairs that may arise. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique reduces the task latency by 29% as compared to other matching-based techniques available in the literature.
The active vibration control technology has been successfully applied to several helicopter types. However, with the increasing of control scale, traditional centralized control algorithms are experiencing significant increase of computational complexity and physical implementation challenging. To address this issue, a diffusion collaboration-based distributed Filtered-x Least Mean Square algorithm applied to active vibration control is proposed, drawing inspiration from the concept of data fusion in wireless sensor network. This algorithm distributes the computation load to each node, and constructs the active vibration control network topology of large-scale system by discarding the weak coupling secondary paths between nodes, achieving distributed active vibration control. In order to thoroughly validate the effectiveness and superiority of this algorithm, a helicopter fuselage model is designed as the research object. Firstly, the excellent vibration reduction performance of the proposed algorithm is confirmed through simulations. Subsequently, specialized node control units are developed, which utilize STM32 microcontroller as the processing unit. Further, a distributed control system is constructed based on multi-processor collaboration. Building on this foundation, a large-scale active vibration control experimental platform is established. Based on the platform, experiments are carried out, involving the 4-input 4-output system and the 8-input 8-output system. The experimental results demonstrate that under steady-state harmonic excitation, the proposed algorithm not only ensures control effectiveness but also reduces computational complexity by 50%, exhibiting faster convergence speed compared with traditional centralized algorithms. Under time-varying external excitation, the proposed algorithm demonstrates rapid tracking of vibration changes, with vibration amplitudes at all controlled points declining by over 94%, proving the strong robustness and adaptive capability of the algorithm.
Cloud computing has brought about a transformation in the delivery model of information technology from a product to a service. It has enabled the availability of various software, platforms and infrastructural resources as scalable services on demand over the internet. However, the performance of cloud computing services is hampered due to their inherent vulnerability to failures owing to the scale at which they operate. It is possible to utilize cloud computing services to their maximum potential only if the performance related issues of reliability, availability, and throughput are handled effectively by cloud service providers. Therefore, fault tolerance becomes a critical requirement for achieving high performance in cloud computing. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of fault tolerance-related issues in cloud computing; emphasizing upon the significant concepts, architectural details, and the state-of-art techniques and methods. The objective is to provide insights into the existing fault tolerance approaches as well as challenges yet required to be overcome. The survey enumerates a few promising techniques that may be used for efficient solutions and also, identifies important research directions in this area.

Fibre optic sensors are attractive for monitoring of composite structures but the significant risk of damage to fibres where they enter the structure and within the structure itself can make their use unreliable. Mesh configurations of embedded fibre Bragg grating sensors with improved robustness are considered for monitoring composite structures. The configurations of single ended line, bidirectional line, loop, and a novel 2×2 mesh are analysed using a probabilistic model of the sensor system robustness. Numerical evaluation of these configurations has shown that the 2×2 mesh configuration provides the greatest robustness of all of the configurations across all inlet port failure probabilities. The probability of a sensor becoming isolated in a 2×2 mesh is approximately 3 times lower than for the bidirectional line configuration. Using a new matrix approach, the 2×2 mesh configuration is analysed in terms of disaggregation of individual sensor spectra for both fault free and faulty conditions. Simulation and experimental evaluation have demonstrated that successful recovery of individual grating spectra is possible with small spurious signals.       Graphical Abstract                                       single ended, bidirectional, loop, and 2×2 mesh configurations of Bragg gratings are analysed using a probabilistic model.        2×2 mesh configuration provides the greatest robustness of all of the configurations across inlet port failure probabilities.        successful recovery of individual grating spectra is possible using a matrix approach for the 2×2 mesh configuration.
We propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm for a novel maximum edge coloring problem which arises from wireless mesh networks [Ashish Raniwala, Tzi-cker Chiueh, Architecture and algorithms for an IEEE 802.11-based multi-channel wireless mesh network, in: INFOCOM 2005, pp. 2223–2234; Ashish Raniwala, Kartik Gopalan, Tzi-cker Chiueh, Centralized channel assignment and routing algorithms for multi-channel wireless mesh networks, Mobile Comput. Commun. Rev. 8 (2) (2004) 50–65]. The problem is to color all the edges in a graph with maximum number of colors under the following          -Constraint: for every vertex in the graph, all the edges incident to it are colored with no more than                                  ) colors. We show that the algorithm is a 2-approximation for the case               and a                                               -approximation for the case               respectively. The case               is of great importance in practice. For complete graphs and trees, polynomial time accurate algorithms are found for them when              . The approximation algorithm gives a feasible solution to channel assignment in multi-channel wireless mesh networks.
Smart power grid is a two-way interconnected network in which information plays a fundamental role in the process of energy transmission and distribution. The smart grid is based on combining ICT with the processing capabilities of computers and electrical systems to increase communication between users. However, smart grids are exposed to a variety of malicious cyber-attacks that can lead to the destruction of basic infrastructure and disrupt communication between the grid and users. Meanwhile, by authenticating the authenticated users, cyber-security can be created in the smart grid. One of the main components of a smart power grid is smart meters. However, to maintain security in a communication, smart meter authentication alone is not enough and it must be ensured that the electricity company’s server is not forgery. Therefore, there is a need for two-way authentication between the smart meter on the home side and the electricity company server. The present work provides a key management layout (based on the elliptic curve cryptography) with two-way authentication for communication outside the home area network The proposed solution is two-way authentication among the smart meter and the security associate in the power company. In other words, the proposed methodology creates a solution to establish a connection between valid users and the smart grid. The proposed protocol evaluates the behavior of cyber-attacks on the smart grid. Attacks such as man-in the middle attacks and retransmission attacks are considered. It was found that, the proposed methodology improves the reliance between smart grid and authenticated users with the increase of secure communications. Moreover, the proposed protocol can prevent an extensive experiment attack. The results also showed that, as the false factor increases, the detection time by the proposed algorithm increases. As the false factor increases from 0.1 to 0.3, the detection time increases by 1.4 s.
Workplace safety is a prominent concern, motivating researchers across diverse disciplines to investigate valuable ways to address its challenges. However, creating an efficient system to address this issue remains a significant challenge. Since many accidents happen due to improper usage or complete removal of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), one straightforward method for enhancing workplace security involves monitoring their usage This paper introduces an Operator Area Network (OAN) system which improves the existing solutions by increasing portability across different users and environments, non-intrusiveness and privacy. To enhance robustness in detecting the situations in which PPEs are not used correctly, we take advantage of Machine Learning to analyse the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) between PPEs in the same OAN The novelty of this work is that it does not exploit RSSI as a proxy of the distance but instead recognizes a signature of the correct wearing of the PPE By employing this system, employers can effectively ensure the proper usage of PPE devices at their worksites while also minimizing any adverse effects on workers’ comfort and reducing the setup burden for employers. The system runs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model several times per second and employs a post-processing algorithm to enhance its initial accuracy further As a result, the system effectively reduces false positives by about 80% and swiftly detects instances of improper usage of the worker’s PPE, raising the alarm in less than seven seconds. Moreover, the post-processing algorithm can be customized to meet the specific needs of different use cases, allowing for a flexible trade-off between the detection time interval and the overall accuracy of the detection system.                       Monitoring of Personal Protective Equipment leveraging embedded IoT devices.        Cost-effective approach to enhance safety while minimizing worker discomfort.        Exploiting Bluetooth Low Energy signal strength (RSSI) for anomaly detection.        Deploy of machine learning algorithm on low-power embedded devices.

5G monitoring holds immense potential for revolutionizing manufacturing processes by enabling real-time data transmission, remote control, enhanced quality control, and increased efficiency. However, it also presents challenges related to 5G monitoring infrastructure. To explore 5G’s potential for process monitoring, this study introduces a novel 5G-enabled architecture designed to address the challenges, enhancing the process monitoring’s efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in the case of milling operation. To investigate the feasibility of this sophisticated 5G network for process monitoring, two testbeds, i.e., the 5G robotic milling testbed and the 5G CNC milling testbed, have been developed. An accelerometer and a laser scanner have been retrofitted with 5G communications capability to capture critical process signals in the testbeds, respectively. It has shown that the sensor data can be upstreamed to a 5G edge server for data analytics and visualization in ultra-low latency. This work highlights the transformative impact of 5G communication on process monitoring for time-critical manufacturing.
Edge Computing (EC) has made decisions regarding offloading tasks. Also, it might be a challenging task for a gadget of the multi-hop cause of competing network models due to the limited bandwidth available. The literature provides several studies on the issue of the multi-hop cloud environment. Moreover, partial offloading of multi-hop computing and dynamic network management leads to network problems. And inefficient performance measured in terms of task completion time has not been factored into current studies. To reduce the average finishing time of all jobs, this article proposed joint multi-task complete unloading and a network that supports the scheduling issue. Several variable decision factors such as the partial systematic ratio of offloading, Offloading remote devices, task start time, path of routing & dynamic network start time were optimized by the formulated problem. To manage tasks, we use the features inherent in multiple processors with various CPU frequencies. Under the restrictions of power & latency, we determine the appropriate quantity of task data to be handled immediately or distributed to the preferred nodes on the clouds remotely. Our objective is to solve the issue of optimization of task scheduling on a limited quasi-quadratic function. We offer an Improved Offloading and Heuristic Flow Optimization (IOHFO) solution effectively to solve these problems by using semi-definite relaxation. Finally, a simulator can be used to evaluate our proposed unloading system to reduce the (optimal) cost of unloading profiles for various parameters.
Using human location data from mobile phones, we developed a method to detail transportation modes around Shinagawa Station in Tokyo and analyzed the impact of hot weather conditions on traffic behavior. Each user's movement history was collected based on the global positioning system (GPS) communication of applications. We estimated the modes of transportation (train, car, walking, and stationary) for each user. By conducting route searches based on each user's data, we calculated the traffic volume for each mode of transportation, linking the estimated population data to network data and confirming accuracy against official census data. In August 2019, we examined the relationship between the estimated transportation modes and the hourly wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which was calculated by the Ministry of the Environment using values measured by the Tokyo Regional Meteorological Observatory. The results indicated that as WBGT increases, fewer pedestrians walk and more remain stationary. Sensitivity to WBGT was four times greater at 20:00 p.m. than at 08:00 a.m., despite similar WBGT levels. This may be because fewer people go out during the hottest part of the day, and the sum of those who go out during the day, i.e., those who return home, is greatly reduced. However, this trend was not observed on weekdays. The results suggest that the impact of summer heat is latent during weekdays due to the demands of work and errands but becomes more pronounced during free time, such as holidays and nighttime.                        Proposed methodology can extract highly detailed modes of human transportation.        Pedestrian responses to weather based on land use and time of day were estimated.        High WBGT leads to decreased walking activity, especially on holidays.        Reduction in pedestrian numbers due to WBGT rise is greater at night than in morning.
In the last few years, Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) have been introduced in the Internet as a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services. Working together, they are able to consolidate and deliver the networking components using standard IT virtualization technologies not only on high-volume servers, but also in end user premises, Telco operator edge and access nodes thus allowing the emergence of new services.    In this context, this paper presents a smart video surveillance platform designed to exploit the facilities offered by full SDN-NFV networks. This platform is based on free and open source software running on Provider Equipment (PE), so allowing function deployment simplification and management cost reduction.
Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) Media Access Control (MAC) has become a leading wireless technology for industrial applications, offering deterministic communication while balancing latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption. This study addresses the critical challenge of cell scheduling within TSCH MAC, emphasising the importance of selecting scheduling mechanisms based on application-specific quality of service parameters. Despite numerous proposals and evaluations, the lack of standardised scheduling methods and comprehensive performance metrics remains a significant obstacle. Traditional network metrics often fail to capture key issues in TSCH-based mesh networks, potentially overlooking indicators of network stability. To address this gap, we examine both application and network metrics from a mesh network perspective and propose a set of complementary metrics tailored to the characteristics of TSCH. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of how scheduling impacts network reliability and efficiency. Given the diverse applications and configurations in industrial environments, this study offers insights into employing these complementary metrics for a more accurate assessment of the impact of TSCH scheduling. Ultimately, our approach aims to improve TSCH scheduling evaluation and contribute to advancing industrial wireless communication systems.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms have been foreseen to play an important role in military applications in the future, wherein they will be frequently subjected to different disturbances and destructions such as attacks and equipment faults. Therefore, a sophisticated robustness evaluation mechanism is of considerable importance for the reliable functioning of the UAV swarms. However, their complex characteristics and irregular dynamic evolution make them extremely challenging and uncertain to evaluate the robustness of such a system. In this paper, a complex network theory-based robustness evaluation method for a UAV swarming system is proposed. This method takes into account the dynamic evolution of UAV swarms, including dynamic reconfiguration and information correlation. The paper analyzes and models the aforementioned dynamic evolution and establishes a comprehensive robustness metric and two evaluation strategies. The robustness evaluation method and algorithms considering dynamic reconfiguration and information correlation are developed. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by conducting a case study analysis. The results can further provide some guidance and reference for the robust design, mission planning and decision-making of UAV swarms.
Recent design techniques are integrating 10 to 100 embedded functional and storage blocks in a single system on chip and the number is growing to increase with further advancements. The bus based interconnections are not a suitable alternative for Massively Parallel Multi-Processors Systems on Chip (MPSoCs) because of power and latency issue. The communication requirements of many-core embedded systems are addressed by the Networks on Chip (NoC) paradigm. In this paper, a minimal and fault tolerant routing algorithm is proposed so as to route packets adaptively through the shortest path in the presence of faulty nodes. Using fault-tolerant routing algorithm to reroute packets around faulty nodes will increase latency. Besides, the performance of NoC is heavily affected by network congestion. Congestion in the network increases the time to traverse a packet from a source to a destination. The proposed routing algorithm adaptively chooses the next node where to send packet, so as to avoid packet drop in presence of congestion. The algorithm does handle both single and multiple busy nodes using reconfigurable paths (minimal and/or non-minimal).
Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated considerable effectiveness when integrated into routing protocols to enhance the performance of Smart Grid Networks. However, their performance across diverse real-world scenarios remains a topic of exploration. In this study, we evaluate the performance and transferability of four ML models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Feedforward Neural Network (FF), Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes—across three distinct scenarios: Barcelona, Montreal, and Rome. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we analyze the varying efficacy of these models in different scenarios. Our results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms other models in the Montreal and Rome scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in predicting the optimal forwarding node for packet transmission. In contrast, Ensemble of Bagged Decision Trees emerge as the optimal model for the Barcelona scenario, exhibiting strong performance in selecting the most suitable forwarding node for packet transmission. However, the transferability of these models to scenarios where they were not trained is notably limited, as evidenced by their decreased performance on datasets from other scenarios. This observation underscores the importance of considering the data characteristics when selecting ML models for real-world applications. Furthermore, we identify that the distribution of nodes within datasets significantly influences model performance, highlighting its critical role in determining model efficacy. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges inherent in transferring ML models between real-world scenarios, providing valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers alike in optimizing ML applications in Smart Grid Networks.
Parallel prefix is an important technique that has been widely accepted in many area of scientific and engineering research. In this paper we propose an improved parallel prefix computation algorithm on          mesh network that requires 2     + 5 times. Our proposed algorithm can be compare with the traditional parallel prefix algorithm that requires 3     + 2 time on same architecture.
The issue of energy constrained and non-renewable energy of sensor nodes has made the node weaker as a critical challenge in wireless sensor networks. The workload of nodes may varies depends on position and mobility of each involved nodes. In mobile environment, the unreachable information, packet drops and link failure influence for the requirement of new protocol. The protocol needs to monitor the network which aims at topological changes and workload of each node. This paper we have considered the problem of determining the reachability of node in the network stimulate into the enhancement of its transmission. So, we propose an Enhanced Ant Colony method (EAC) for such critical node in mobile WSNs by considering mobility as a key metric. It optimizes the routing paths, providing an effective reliable data path transmission for acquiring reliable communications in the case of critical node. The main goal is to maintain the maximum lifetime of network, during data transmission in an efficient manner. This paper contributes the implementation of this work and makes a comparison of its performance with AODV routing protocol based on packet delivery ratio, throughput, jitter, delay and energy level.
Full-duplex (FD) wireless communication improves the attainable spectral efficiency of the wireless network with the simultaneous transmission and reception over the same frequency channel at a single timeslot. However, the effect of self-interference (SI) and inter-user interference (IUI) become crucial to take into consideration compared to the current half-duplex system. Many researches have been studied to suppress the SI and IUI, to design the medium access control (MAC) protocol, and to propose resource management techniques for realizing the FD system and truly achieving the double transmission capacity in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel FD MAC protocol with a mixture of concurrent and sequential transmission scheme, namely FD-MCST, for maximizing the transmission capacity in multihop wireless networks. Through FD-MCST, the transmitting node can cooperatively share the transmission capacity status for maximizing the network capacity. As a result, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed FD-MCST can accomplish a higher achievable network capacity of up to 1.7 times and nearly twice the achievable throughput with a reasonable amount of achievable transmission overhead about 7.7%, compared to the existing FD MAC protocols.

In this paper we present a customized Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Wireless Sensing and Monitoring Platform to monitor the temperature, relative humidity and light in the context of building automation. In developed system, data is sent from the transmitter node to the receiver node through a customized hopping method. The data received at the receiver node is monitored and recorded in an excel sheet in a personal computer (PC) through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), made in LabVIEW. An Android application has also been developed through which data is transferred from LabVIEW to a smartphone through which data is remotely monitored.
The construction of multicast tree within given constraints, such as delay and capacity, is becoming a major problem in many wireless networks, especially wireless mesh networks (WMN). Due to the limited capacity of the wireless node, a multicast call may be dropped if there is no multicast tree formed within the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has a lesser number of transmissions for a given CF. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high throughput, packet delivery fraction and less latency compared to other well-known algorithms in this category.
The growing demands for data links capacity in maritime vessels and high costs of satellite communication links through mandatory GMDSS Inmarsat equipment emphasize the possibility of optimizing data traffic routes through alternative service providers either satellite or terrestrial. Lower cost services, as well as increased link capacity will justify introduction of new technologies onboard ships. Implementation of new technologies is important, but also the appropriate implementation of processes and the awareness and motivation of the people on board that ensures the value of such a service. In order to realize more convenient link, the development of a mathematical model is proposed as basis for decision making optimization of data traffic route in communication of maritime vessels. In addition to the presentation of previous research, the paper also shows the optimization of data traffic route by the example of authentic maritime communications within the organizational environment.
This paper describes an on-going effort in a school in Singapore to leverage a networked mesh of open-source environmental sensors to help teachers surface students’ evolving intuitions and conceptions about their local microclimate through a STEM-based curriculum. Data polled from the sensors is represented visually in an immersive environment which is a facsimilie of the school campus. Students’ intuitions about geography and other disciplinary domains are – by definition – tacit, yet they are critical in shaping understanding of broader disciplinary concepts. Through surfacing such intuitions in ways which are authentic to the students, the former become boundary objects which can subsequently be dialogued about with peers and teachers.

We study wavelength assignment in an optical network where each fiber has a fixed capacity of          wavelengths. Given demand routes, we aim to minimize the maximum ratio between the number of fibers deployed on a link      and the number of fibers required on the same link      when wavelength assignment is allowed to be fractional. Our main results are negative ones. We show that there is no constant-factor approximation unless NP         ZPP. In addition, unless NP                                 we show that there is no                   approximation for any                        and no                   approximation for any                            is the number of links in the network. Our analysis is based on the hardness of approximating the chromatic numbers. On the positive side, we present algorithms with approximation ratios                                                                                    respectively, where               is the length of the longest path.
IoT uses wireless sensor networks (WSN) to deploy many sensors to track environmental and physical parameters. The WSN measurements are frequently contaminated and altered by noise. The noise in the signal increases the sensor node’s computation and energy utilization, resulting in less longevity of the sensor node. The Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is commonly employed in WSN to pre-process sensed signals to remove noise from the sensed signals using delay elements, multipliers, and adders. Traditional multiplier-based FIR filter designs result in hardware-intensive multipliers that consume a lot of energy, and area and have low computation speed. These drawbacks make them unsuitable for IoT-based WSN systems with stringent power efficiency necessities. Approximate computing enhances the energy efficiency of an FIR filter. Arithmetic circuits utilizing approximate computing improve the hardware performance, with some loss of accuracy to save energy utilization and boost speed. A novel approximate multiplier architecture employing a fast and straightforward approximation adder is proposed in this study. Approximate multiplier M1 using OR gate and approximate multiplier M2 using proposed approximate adders are compared. The proposed approximate adder is suited for building an adder tree to accumulate partial product (PP) because it is less complicated than traditional adders. Compared to a one-bit-full adder, the critical path delay (CPD) is reduced significantly in the proposed methods. The accuracy comparison of M1. M2 and Wallace tree using the normalized mean error distance (NMED), the mean relative error distance (MRED), the maximum error (ME), and the error rate (ER) with the number of bits utilized for reducing error. For the area (delay) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.4 ns for M1, 0.43 ns for M2, and 1.08 ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. For the delay (area) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.16 ns for M1, 0.16 ns for M2, and 0.40 ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. To more accurately evaluate performance at the circuit level, the PDP and ADP are computed. The NMED, MRED, ME, and ER versus PDP and ADP are computed. The proposed multipliers M1 and M2 are compared with existing approximate multipliers. When an equivalent MRED, NMED, or ER is taken into account, M1 has the smallest ADP and PDP among other multipliers. The very low likelihood of a significant ED occurring is indicated by the small values of NMED and MRED in M1 and M2. The proposed solutions effectively reduce delay, area, and power while maintaining increased accuracy and performance.
We consider the problem of scheduling a sequence of packets over a linear network, where every packet has a source and a target, as well as a release time and a deadline by which it must arrive at its target. The model we consider is bufferless, where packets are not allowed to be buffered in nodes along their paths other than at their source. This model applies to optical networks where opto-electronic conversion is costly, and packets mostly travel through bufferless hops. The offline version of this problem was previously studied in M. Adler et al. (2002)      . In this paper we study the online version of the problem, where we are required to schedule the packets without knowledge of future packet arrivals. We use competitive analysis to evaluate the performance of our algorithms. We present the first online algorithms for several versions of the problem. For the problem of   throughput maximization  , where all packets have uniform weights, we give an algorithm with a logarithmic competitive ratio, and present some lower bounds. For other weight functions, we show algorithms that achieve optimal competitive ratios.
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolutionary networking paradigm which has been adopted by large network and cloud providers, among which are Tech Giants. However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged.    Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations. Accordingly, the body of literature on hSDN research has improved remarkably. On this account, we present this paper as a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey which expands upon hSDN from many different perspectives.
ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) is a wireless mesh networking protocol low in cost, power, data rate, and complexity. To access Lo- cal Area Networks (LAN), 802.11b/g standard is used all over the world as Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) standard. IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and IEEE 802.11b/g Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are often collocated, causing a coexistence. The coexistence occurs because these networks share the same 2.4    GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. A Simulation model has been introduced which completely reflects the ZigBee and WiFi coexistence. We have proposed   frequency agility based interference avoidance algorithm  . However, algorithm detects interference and adaptively switch nodes to safe channel for dynamically avoid WLAN interference with lower latency and energy consumption. The performance of ZigBee under WiFi is empirically evaluated in terms of the packet error rate (PER) and bit error rate (BER). The Simulation results us- ing   frequency agility algorithm   demonstrate that the design guideline can efficiently mitigate the effect of WiFi interference and enhance the performance of ZigBee networks.
Wireless mesh architecture is a first step towards providing high-bandwidth network coverage. This architecture has major drawback of losing bandwidth over multiple hops thereby resulting in poor quality of service (QoS) at nodes separated by more than two hops. This paper proposes a three step approach to guarantee bandwidth demand at each node of the network thereby providing high quality of service even to nodes separated by large distances from each other. The authors have presented a novel method for clustering the nodes and load sharing amongst the clusters based on graph partitioning approach. This work also presents a system and method of integrating Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) with wired network for further increase in the QoS.
In a densely deployed sensor network, each sensor node senses some event and transmits it to a particular sink via multi hop communications. Sensor nodes deployed nearby the sink node need to convey extra data and control packets, thus undergo much quicker energy depletion rates and therefore have considerably smaller estimated lifespan of network. In the paper, we have analyzed the proficiency of AODV, DSR and TORA protocols in presence of energy holes problem in a wireless sensor network. Throughput, average energy consumption, end to end delay, work efficiency, packet delivery ratio, packet drop rate, nodes alive and routing overhead of each protocol have been demonstrated under different node density. The usefulness of some prevailing approaches towards extenuating this problem has been carried out and simulation results are used to confirm the analysis. It is observed that AODV and DSR protocol outperform TORA in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio whereas in case of Work efficiency AODV outperforms DSR and TORA protocol. AODV has a smaller amount of end to end delay and average energy consumption as equated to DSR and TORA protocols while Packet drop rate is least in TORA protocol. Routing overhead is lesser in DSR protocol as compared to AODV and TORA. Number of alive nodes in DSR protocol is greater as compared to AODV and TORA.
In social network analysis, the importance of an actor can be found by using the centrality metrics. There are many centrality metrics available e.g. degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector etc. In research community authors forms a social network, which is called Research Professionals’ Collaboration Network. This is similar to social network where each author is an actor and an article written together by some authors establishes collaboration between them. Each author acquires a certain value based on the citation of their articles. There are many citation indices are available such as citation count, h-index, g-index, i10-index etc. To analyze the Research Professionals’ collaboration Network and for finding the key author, the citation indices can be used. In this paper, we compare and combine both social network analysis metrics and the citation indices to get better result in finding the key author.
In the context of the burgeoning progression of wireless network technology and the corresponding escalation in the demand for mobile Internet-based multimedia transmission services, the task of preserving and augmenting user satisfaction has emerged as an imperative concern. This necessitates a sophisticated and accurate evaluation of multimedia service quality within the sphere of wireless networks. To systematically address the nuanced issue of user experience quality, the present study introduces a novel method for evaluating multimedia Quality of Experience (QoE) in wireless networks, employing an advanced deep learning model as the underlying analytical framework. Initially, the research undertakes the task of modeling the video session process, giving due consideration to the status of each temporal interval within the session's architecture. Subsequently, the challenge of QoE prediction is dissected and investigated through the lens of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), culminating in the proposition of an all-encompassing QoE prediction model that harmoniously integrates video information, Quality of Service (QoS) data, user behavior analytics, and facial expression analysis. The empirical segment of this research serves to validate the efficacy of the suggested video QoE evaluation method, engaging both quantitative and qualitative comparison metrics with contemporaneous state-of-the-art QoE models, employing the RTVCQoE dataset as the empirical foundation. The experimental findings illuminate that the QoE model elucidated in this study transcends competing models in performance metrics such as PLCC, SRCC, and KRCC. Consequently, this investigation stands as a seminal contribution to academic literature, furnishing an exacting and dependable QoE evaluation methodology. Such a contribution augments the user experience landscape in multimedia services within wireless networks, and instigates further scholarly exploration and technological innovation in the mobile Internet domain.
Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) plays a significant role in the field of environment-oriented monitoring, traffic monitoring, etc. Here, wide contributions that are made toward routing in WSN are explored. The paper mainly aims to categorize the routing problems and examines the routing-related optimization problems. For achieving the motive, 50 papers from the standard journals are collected and primarily reviewed in a chronological way. Later, various features that are related to energy, security, speed and reliability problems of routing are discussed. Subsequently, the literature is analyzed based on the simulation environment and experimental setup, awareness over the Quality of Service (QoS) and the deployment against various applications. In addition, the optimization of the routing algorithms and the meta-heuristic study of routing optimization are explored. Routing is a vast area with numerous unsolved issues and hence, various research gaps along with future directions are also presented.
Multicast applications such as video conferencing, weather forecasting and on-line multi player gaming are major areas of Internet traffic growth. The disparity between bandwidth offered by a wavelength and the bandwidth requirement of a multicast connection can be purposefully solved by grooming low bandwidth connection requests into a high bandwidth wavelength channel in an optical network. In this paper, we discuss multicast traffic grooming problem using light-tree approach with static multicast connection requests. As higher layer electronic ports such as transmitters and receivers are dominant cost factors in a WDM mesh networks, it is critical to reduce their number when grooming multicast traffic into high bandwidth trees. This paper propose a heuristic algorithm called Saturated-Light-Tree based Multicast Traffic Grooming (SLTMTG) that solves grooming, routing and wavelength assignment problems. SLTMTG algorithm is based on grooming of multicast traffic to constrained light-trees in which traffic is groomed for better resource utilizations. This approach is used to minimize the grooming cost as well as wavelength requirement. Here, proposed approach tries to satisfy all connection requests. The performance of proposed algorithm has compared with existing Multicast Traffic Grooming (MTG) algorithm. The results are compared on several standard networks to measure cost and wavelength utilization.
Rock failure can cause serious geological disasters, and the non-extensive statistical features of electric potential (EP) are expected to provide valuable information for disaster prediction. In this paper, the uniaxial compression experiments with EP monitoring were carried out on fine sandstone, marble and granite samples under four displacement rates. The Tsallis entropy      value of EPs is used to analyze the self-organization evolution of rock failure. Then the influence of displacement rate and rock type on      value are explored by mineral structure and fracture modes. A self-organized critical prediction method with      value is proposed. The results show that the probability density function (PDF) of EPs follows the     -Gaussian distribution. The displacement rate is positively correlated with      value. With the displacement rate increasing, the fracture mode changes, the damage degree intensifies, and the microcrack network becomes denser. The influence of rock type on      value is related to the burst intensity of energy release and the crack fracture mode. The      value of EPs can be used as an effective prediction index for rock failure like      value of acoustic emission (AE). The results provide useful reference and method for the monitoring and early warning of geological disasters.
We solve the mesh router placement nodes problem in Wireless Mesh Networks by Tabu Search.        The problem is a bi-objective optimization maximizing network connectivity and user coverage.        The experimental evaluation showed the efficiency of TS in solving a benchmark of instances.              Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are an important networking paradigm that offer cost effective Internet connectivity. The performance and operability of WMNs depend, among other factors, on the placement of network nodes in the area. Among the most important objectives in designing a WMN is the formation of a mesh backbone to achieve high user coverage. Given a number of router nodes to deploy, a deployment area and positions of client nodes in the area, an optimization problem can be formulated aiming to find the placement of router nodes so as to maximize network connectivity and user coverage. This optimization problem belongs to facility location problems, which are computationally hard to solve to optimality. In this paper we present the implementation and evaluation of Tabu Search (TS) for the problem of mesh router node placement in WMNs. The experimental evaluation showed the efficiency of TS in solving a benchmark of instances.
Globally, neonatal mortality remains unacceptability high. Physiological monitoring is foundational to the care of these vulnerable patients to assess neonatal cardiopulmonary status, guide medical intervention, and determine readiness for safe discharge. However, most existing physiological monitoring systems require multiple electrodes and sensors, which are linked to wires tethered to wall-mounted display units, to adhere to the skin. For neonates, these systems can cause skin injury, prevent kangaroo mother care, and complicate basic clinical care. Novel, wireless, and biointegrated sensors provide opportunities to enhance monitoring capabilities, reduce iatrogenic injuries, and promote family-centric care. Early validation data have shown performance equivalent to (and sometimes exceeding) standard-of-care monitoring systems in premature neonates cared for in high-income countries. The reusable nature of these sensors and compatibility with low-cost mobile phones have the future potential to enable substantially lower monitoring costs compared with existing systems. Deployment at scale, in low-income countries, holds the promise of substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes.
A kSP-inspired re-routing algorithm is proposed to mitigate traffic congestion.        A grid traffic network model is developed imitating actual traffic events.        This re-routing algorithm is simulated and implemented to solve the developed model.        The performance of this algorithm is validated by comparing with similar methods.        This algorithm is proven to have outperformed others in congestion alleviation in heavy traffic.                This paper proposes a possible methodology for detecting and mitigating traffic congestion. This method is carried out using a custom-designed traffic scenario model. The model is fully developed in lieu of abundant data support from actual traffic events, which is applicable to localized traffic surveillance conditions, where massive data collection from surveilling devices is infeasible or unviable. This approach includes two parts: model construction and re-routing strategy. The model construction part focuses on the development of a traffic driving scenario, which takes various criteria such as traffic volume and traffic signal into consideration. The goal of this setup is to create a realistic-possible environment, where the proposed methods can be tested. The re-routing strategy is implemented based on the model simulation result of a medium-scale drive-able road map. The idea of the adaptive vehicle re-routing strategy is inspired by the     -shortest path algorithm, adapted with the dynamic congestion re-routing strategy. It will be shown that the model is able to automatically identify congestion patterns that are happening on any road segments, and then initiates a proper re-routing strategy to alleviate such congestion in a timely manner. Although the methodology is realized and validated within a simulated model, the concept is transparent to any transportation system under study without extra complexity. In addition, the proposed modeling and simulation technique can be used for real-time implementation in intelligent transportation management systems.
This paper presents the throughput characteristics for an All-WiMAX (AW) and a Hybrid Wi-Fi –WiMAX (HWW) video surveillance system with varying number of nodes, frame rate and MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) size. An AW video surveillance system consists of WiMAX IP cameras connected directly to the Base stations while the HWW system consists of Wi-Fi IP cameras linked to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) which is equally linked to the base station. Local viewing PCs are connected at the CPE while remote viewing can be done via the internet. WiMAX and Wi-Fi IP cameras capture the video images; convert them to an appropriate digital signal and transmit them via Ethernet cables or wireless interface links. The investigation of the performance of the AW and HWW systems has been done by simulation of the systems using the OPNET modeler.    Results show that, under similar conditions, the HWW video surveillance system outperforms the AW system in terms of throughput by a factor of 1.75. The results further show that throughput increases with increase in MSDU size and/or video resolutions, frame rate, number of nodes and decrease with increase in frame time, the reverse being true as well.
Lighting systems, as one of the biggest energy consumers on a global scale, are being upgraded based on innovative energy-saving (hereafter E-saving), energy-efficiency (E-efficiency), and energy-cost (E-cost) reduction schemes. According to research, among lighting systems, public lighting systems (PLSs) have significant potential for such energy projects. It can be realized through smart dimming, installing light-emitting diode (LED) luminaries, using renewable energy, etc. Accordingly, this work reviews the E-saving, E-efficiency, and E-cost reduction schemes for real-world PLSs by giving related techno-economic formulation. In this regard, smart control/dimming approaches via combined Internet of Things and wireless technologies, installing LED luminaires, optimal layout design, reactive power compensation, etc., are discussed by reporting the saving potentials, the payback period of the investment, and carbon reduction effects. Moreover, the use of renewable energy (including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, pump-    -turbine systems, biomass plants, etc.) integrated with batteries to power PLSs is discussed by giving the E-cost reduction potential. Moreover, the pros/cons of previous works, the key findings of this review work, and recommendations for future works are outlined. This work shows future research directions, identifies high-potential energy projects for energy planners, and outlines the importance of renewable energy in making PLSs more environmentally friendly. Moreover, the role of energy policymakers’ financial support in expediting the widespread enforcement of energy projects is outlined by studying the payback period of projects, which is about 5–7 years (on average 5.8 years, 6.9 years, 4.9 years, and 5.6 years for E-saving, E-efficiency, combined E-saving/E-efficiency, and E-cost reduction schemes, respectively).

In the proposed system, implementation of the low power sensor nodes is proposed. 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network was developed to enable the Wireless Embedded Internet by simplifying IPv6 functionality, defining very compact header formats and taking the nature of wireless networks into account. Our solution contains two types of nodes Wireless Sensor Node and Border Router/Gateway Node. Wireless Sensor Node: These nodes have sensors integrated and are used to gather the information and send to the Border Router/Gateway Node. They create a mesh network among them, forwarding the packets of other nodes in order to make the information reach the Border Router/Gateway Node. Each Wireless Sensor Node is equipped with a 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio, sensors and a battery. It can be either a microcontroller based or Linux based embedded platforms. Border Router/Gateway Node: This node takes the information sent by the Wireless Sensor Nodes and sends it to the Tunneling IPv4 / IPv6 server by using the Ethernet IPv4 interface. Each Border Router/Gateway Node is equipped with a Linux based Single Board Computer, 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio and an Ethernet interface and a battery.
Smart Grids are the control and transmission networks of the future; they allow suppliers and customers to interact in real time to optimize and intelligently manage resources. Although wireless mesh network technology can facilitate these smart functionalities, it is important to address the vulnerabilities and cyber-attack risks that are inherent to it. Smart Grid's reliance on the Internet amplifies security concerns. A number of methods have been proposed to address this issue; while some have made promises, they all need substantial amounts of computational resources. With this technology, channels based on trust can be set up. The security of the system is built utilizing a family relationship-based method, which makes use of measures that may be used to gauge a node's originality. Additionally, the power consumption and signal strength of the node are taken into account. The complexity and extent of the network need the development of new types of smart grid communication. Finding a way to detect and thwart major assaults on routing protocols is another design challenge. Smart grids rely on these protocols in its data system for efficient interchange of renewable energy. A unique secure energy routing mechanism is developed in this proposed model for secure data communication. In the proposed model, a new method for Neighbor Nodes Trust Tagging Model for Optimized Route Detection (NNTT-ORD) is proposed for establishing secure route for data communication in smart grids. The proposed model is compared with the existing model and the results represent that the proposed model route provides a secure environment for data transmission.
This work presents a simulation methodology for product pipelines in the oil industry.        The methodology handles multiple refineries and branching in the pipe structure.        The proposed simulator is capable to validate scheduling plans as long as one month.        The operation of the simulator is explained through illustrative examples.              An oil company produces a variety of products in refineries and often transports them in pipelines. Pipelines allow huge amounts of refined oil products to be transported between sites. Delivery scheduling plans determine the sequences of the pumping operations. Specifically, these plans specify the types and quantities of products to be transported, the start and end times of shipments, and the routes. A scheduling plan is feasible, if its implementation is free of any obstacles. Schedules can be validated manually only in case of short time intervals (3, 4 days) and only for a moderately complex pipeline network. If the scheduling plan is longer or the pipeline network is larger, then a simulation tool is required for the validation. This work presents a novel discrete-event simulation system, which helps to validate pipeline-schedule for medium time intervals in multi-source mesh-like pipeline networks.
Buildings and other facilities must protect their assets and occupants from hazards and unauthorised intrusion, with access control systems a critical component of the management of the facilities. The advent of pervasive systems and cyber-physical systems means that access control can become dynamic, responding to the observed locations of people and objects, and meeting the stated needs of the occupants. We present three components of a smart ambient access control system for safety and security. We describe dynamic routing around mobile assets or hazards, dynamic security classification which changes the security state of rooms and zones based on observed presence of items, and dynamic zone configuration, which adapts the access states of controlled doorways to construct larger virtual zones, to provide for free movement within newly constructed zones, and to provide secure zones around assets and people as required. The components are demonstrated in an architecture integrating GPS-enabled devices, webservers, management software and optimisation solvers.
A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a continuously self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of the wireless mobile device. Nodes are connected wirelessly and also responsible for data forwarding (no data transfer or routing device is present that is a router, switch, etc.). The opportunistic network is a subcategory of MANET, typically wireless handheld device carried by people. This survey admits a summary of the acquirable OPPNETs routing algorithms, their categorization, and an assessment of five routing protocols (Epidemic, Spray and Wait, First Contact, Prophet, and Max-Prop) in terms of variable buffer size. Detailed computer simulation demonstrates that as the burden or load on the network growths, the efficiency of routing strategies decrease in terms of delivery probability and overhead ratio. The experiments establish that Maxprop routing delivery probability is highest than the others. It has been also observed that the ratio of packet dropped and relayed has been decreased according to buffer size increased. The First Contact routing delivery probability may not differ most with changes the buffer sizes. In terms of overhead ratio, the result of Epidemic is better than Spray and Wait, First Contact, Prophet, MaxProp routing algorithms. Results vary depending on the buffer size, contact times, and speed. The consequences indicate that some can carry and exchange information faster, and improve connectivity in OPPNETs.
We consider the problem of routing a number of communication requests in WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) all-optical networks from the standpoint of game theory. If we view each routing request (pair of source-target nodes) as a player, then a strategy consists of a path from the source to the target and a frequency (color). To reflect the restriction that two requests must not use the same frequency on the same edge, conflicting strategies are assigned a prohibitively high cost.   Under this formulation, we consider several natural cost functions, each one reflecting a different aspect of restriction in the available bandwidth. For each cost function we examine the problem of the existence of pure Nash equilibria, the complexity of recognizing and computing them and finally, the problem in which we are given a Nash equilibrium and we are asked to find a better one in the sense that the total bandwidth used is less. As it turns out some of these problems are tractable and others are NP-hard.
This paper systematizes network planning procedures (NPP) and network structure adjustments (NSA) to showcase the strength and weaknesses of different planning approaches as well as their integrability. Therefore, a set of NPP and NSA is introduced with regard to a multi-dimensional taxonomy.    To ensure network quality at the macro level, as well as to address quality of access and urban space, a neighbourhood network NPP focused on the quality of access should be established in addition to a connectivity-oriented NPP. The urban transport network is thus created through the interaction of NPP for connectivity-oriented networks and for access-oriented networks, as well as local NSA. The result is a framework for an integrated procedure.
This paper investigates the new trends in the field of “pervasive” or “ubiquitous” computing in logistics. Over the past two decades, research challenges in pervasive computing have evolved following the rapid progress of information and communication technology. Researchers are working to create an “Internet of Things” that globally interconnects smart devices and sensor networks. Technologies such as wireless communication, ubiquitous sensors, and passive or semi-passive RFID, are essential to monitor the transport chain. “Pervasive adaptation” is a new research challenge that has been recently introduced to describe system's ability to autonomously recognize the situation and adapt to situational changes. For example, it is expected that intelligent parcels that can observe and evaluate current environmental conditions including traffic information, velocity, new orders, temperature, or storage conditions, and decide adaptations such as changing transport route or destination and swapping vehicle. In order modern ubiquitous computing devices to become fully functional they need to overcome compatibility and security problems; these issues as well as potential solutions are explored in this paper. On the other hand, as new technology such as Ultra High Frequency RFID becomes more mature, it is launching into ubiquitous status in commerce and society.
We derive a family of labeled, undirected graphs from the Stirling table of the first kind and investigate properties of these graphs as a basis for multiprocessor interconnection networks. The diameter of a Stirling network with      nodes is ⌈           +1)⌉ − 1, the average distance is less than              , and the number of links is            ). Stirling networks can be inductively specified with incrementability of one, and adjacencies can be determined solely by the node addresses. Many standard networks including full-ringed binary trees, tree machines, meshes and half mesh of trees are shown to be embedded in these combinatorial networks.   Properties of Stirling networks are analyzed and related to the underlying mathematical structure. We present a routing scheme that is deadlock free, avoids congestions, and can be executed on the fly by bit manipulation of node labels. A methodology for modular construction of these networks yields estimates for the VLSI area required for their layout. Fault-tolerance properties are analyzed, a vulner-ability of 1 is proved, and fault-handling abilities in presence of faulty nodes or links are demonstrated. We also show how several classes of parallel algorithms can be efficiently implemented using these networks.
The traditional distribution network is gradually evolving into the cyber physical distribution system (CPDS) to suit the new characteristics of the distribution network. Distribution network plays an important role of risk source and vulnerable sector. Therefore, it is necessary to do some research on the reliability assessment for CPDS. The key factors of reliability assessment for the distribution network mainly including network components, cyber medium, network topology are firstly analyzed. Reliability assessment index is then summarized in terms of traditional physical system, common cyber system and the CPDS from extensive literature. This is followed by a review of reliability assessment methods in CPDS, which is mainly categorized into two aspects. Finally, the future research emphases are discussed.
Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of sensor nodes each having limited communication range. Therefore, some nodes may become isolated during the operation of the network. The existing node connectivity algorithms for WSN aim to reduce the number of isolated nodes and increase the network coverage, but the distance between the isolated nodes and potential parent nodes is not properly considered during node connection. In this paper a novel approach for node connection with ZigBee-based WSN is proposed which applies the Dixon’s test to the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) samples. It allows accurate node connection even with a small number of RSSI values by eliminating the outliers. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed scheme consistently displays higher accuracy than the existing schemes with various numbers of RSSI samples, while the processing time required for node connection is very small.
The popularization of EVs (electric vehicles) has brought an increasingly heavy burden to the development of charging facilities. To meet the demand of rapid energy supply during the driving period, it is necessary to establish a fast charging station in public area. However, EVs arrive at the charging station randomly and connect to the distribution network for fast charging, it causes the grid power to fluctuate greatly and the peak-valley loads to alternate frequently, which is harmful to the stability of distribution network. In order to reduce the power fluctuation of random charging, the energy storage is used for fast charging stations. The queuing model is determined to demonstrate the load characteristics of fast charging station, and the state space of fast charging station system is described by Markov chain. After that the power of grid and energy storage is quantified as the number of charging pile, and each type of power is configured rationally to establish the random charging model of energy storage fast charging station. Finally, the economic benefit is analyzed according to the queuing theory to verify the feasibility of the model.
In parallel and distributed systems many communications take place concurrently. The efficient delivery of all the messages depends on the routing algorithms as well as the underlying interconnection network topology. The grid is a planar network topology that lends itself for efficient VLSI implementation and therefore is of interest for theoretical analysis. Frequently, networks and switches achieve high performance by delivering the messages through shortest paths. In addition, network fault tolerance improves through insuring that the traversed paths are both edge and/or node disjoint. The edge disjoint criterion is useful when network links are the predominant constraint, and the node disjoint criterion becomes important when switches are the fault tolerant bottleneck. Because the latter necessarily implies the former, it is apparent that node disjointness contributes to fault tolerance and enhanced performance. In this paper, we examine the     -pairwise node and edge disjoint shortest paths problem in the undirected graph topology of the grid. Herein it is shown that the     -pairwise node as well as the     -pairwise edge disjoint shortest paths decision problems are NP-hard, and remain NP-hard even for many different restrictions on the problem. We also discuss polynomial time algorithms for restricted versions of our problems.
Connected Square Network Graphs                 in the study of Selcuk (2022) and Selcuk and Tankul (2022) is reconsidered in this paper. Although                 is a 2-dimensional mesh structure, the most important feature of this graph is that it is a hypercube variant. For this reason, this study focuses on development algorithms that find solutions to various problems for                 with the help of hypercube. Firstly, an efficient algorithm that finds the Hamiltonian path is given. Further, two different algorithms that perform the mapping of labels in graph and the unicast routing are given. Furthermore, the parallel process for mapping and unicast routing is discussed. Finally, guidelines are given for broadcasting algorithms.
Sensors have become ubiquitous in buildings but are rarely connected to a network, and their potential to analyse the performance, use, and interaction with a building is not yet fully realised. In the coming years, we expect sensors in buildings to become part of the Internet of Things (    ) and grow in numbers to form a Dense Indoor Sensor Network (    ) that allows for unprecedented analysis of the performance, use, and interaction with buildings. Multiple technologies vie for leading this transformation. We explore Long Range Wide Area Network (    ) as an alternative for creating indoor sensor networks that extends beyond its original long-distance communication purpose. For the present paper, we developed a      with 390 sensor nodes and four gateways and empirically evaluated its performance for two years. Our analysis of more than 86 million transmissions revealed that     s achieve a much lower distance coverage compared to estimations from previous research indicating that more gateways are required. In addition, the deployment of multiple gateways decreased the loss of transmissions due to environmental and network factors. Given the complexity of our system, we received few colliding concurrent messages, which demonstrates a gap between the projected requirements of      systems and the actual requirements of real-world applications given sufficient gateways. We also contribute to the modelling of transmissions with our comparison of attenuation models derived from multiple methodologies. Across all models, we find that robust coverage in an indoor environment can be maintained by placing a gateway every 30 m and every 5 floors. Finally, we also investigate the application of     s for the passive sensing and visualisation of human presence using a Digital Twin (    ) and a Fused Twins (    ) representation in Augmented Reality (    ). A passive sensing approach allows us to gather relevant data on human use of a building while still preserving privacy via the aggregation process. Immersive   in situ   visualisations in      allow for new interactions and new forms of participation. We conclude that     s are already technologically feasible today and basing them on Low Power Wide Area Network (    ) offers intriguing possibilities to reduce energy consumption, maintenance cost, and bandwidth use while also enabling new forms of human-building interaction.       Graphical abstract                                       Dense Indoor      with 4 gateways and 390 sensors over 8 floors and 64 m.        More than 86 million transmissions and 139 million data points collected over two years.        Signal quality analysis requires mixed models instead of linear models, on par with modern neural networks.        A gateway every 30 m and 5 floors guarantees signal quality (30 × 5 rule).        Our Dense Indoor Sensor Network captures indicators of human presence in space.
A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a system of sensor nodes that communicate with one another and with their surroundings. Wireless sensor nodes are now used as the foundation for the higher-level industrial internet of things applications. Any type of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) application, as long as the data is collected utilizing the device's sensors. WSN are severely limited in terms of energy. Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09% to 68.13%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23% to 29.12%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33% to 82.38% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience.
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) provides facility of driving assistance and multimedia services to the road users. To improve the Intelligent Transportation System, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks are the most prominent area that improve the services of ITS. Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks apply multiple channel medium access control scheme according to the IEEE 1609.4 standard draft. According to the standard draft multiple channel medium access control scheme, channels are split into service channels (SCHs) and control channel (CCHs). This work proposes a dynamic control channel interval (DCI) MAC scheme that can variably fix the time interval between SCHs and CCH efficiently. This work divides the SCHs interval time into small interval time slots according to the current network traffic load.
Core systems with network transactions deployed semiconductor materials to develop wireless networks-on-chip to minimize latency with increased performance. For transmitting data from the source point towards the target point, an appropriate reconfigurable routing method has to be deployed with respect to nodes. For overhead on-chip communication that involves the linking of many cores in a single chip, congestion may occur which has to be eliminated. A marching memory arbitrator is deployed in the path that is prone to congestion which computes the port as a buffer. The static degradation of energy power utilization in the router is solved by using a Marching memory buffer. The secure communication of data can be deployed with hash, identity, and address verification blocks. The traffic is then relaxed by routing arbitrator and then data transmission is done through frequency division multiplexing in the communication channel with reconfigurable routing. The analysis of simulation results is found to have a better throughput, less latency, and reduced power consumption.
The growing use of Internet of Things devices and the increasing demand for high-speed, reliable, and secure wireless connectivity pose significant challenges for existing wireless networking solutions in modern smart homes. As such, there is an increasing urgency for the development of advanced and effective wireless technologies that can fulfil the new requirements for interconnected devices and services deployed in households. Tri-band Wi-Fi 6E equipment addresses these needs by reducing the network congestion and enhancing the performance across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. However, improper band management can lead to frequent interference and network issues. As such, this work introduces a dynamic Wi-Fi link orchestration solution that follows a heuristic model. This approach aims to optimize the network layout and channel allocation based on device metrics, utilizing the EasyMesh specification for simplified network setup and management. The model was implemented and tested in a residential environment network, using EasyMesh and tri-band Wi-Fi 6E devices. Results show the effectiveness of the model in improving network capacity and adapting the links to the current traffic, outperforming the initial and base network configuration.
In optical networks, such as OPS/OBS, the network results into significant loss in the network layer. When the loss significantly deteriorates the QoS by increasing the Bit Error Rate (BER), a viable approach can be used to increase the performance. This paper presents state of the art of Quality of Service (QoS) schemes used for improving the performance of optical networks. Furthermore, some possible applications and performance data are summarized based on Packet Loss Rate (PLR), secrecy, survivability and other parameters. The different states of art methods proposed by several authors are compared with Coded Packet Transport (CPT) scheme. We believe that this study is valuable to researchers envisaging a novel approach to enhance the performance of optical networks for telecommunications networks of the future.

The digitisation of agriculture, integral to Agriculture 4.0, has brought significant benefits while simultaneously escalating cybersecurity risks. With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity. This is essential for protecting the agriculture sector in the era of digital transformation, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain against emerging cyber risks.                       Conducts a systematic literature review for cyber threat intelligence (CTI).        Compares techniques in unstructured/structured sources for robust cybersecurity.        Analyses techniques aligned with Agriculture 4.0's Smart Farming Infrastructure layers.        Proposes two taxonomies for CTI techniques and sources in Smart Farming Ecosystem.
We introduce a class of multiscale decompositions for scattered discrete data, motivated by sensor network applications. A specific feature of these decompositions is that they do not rely on any type of mesh or connectivity between the data points. The decomposition is based on a thinning procedure that organizes the points in a multiscale hierarchy and on a local prediction operator based on least-square polynomial fitting. We prove that the resulting multiscale coefficients obey the same decay properties as classical wavelet coefficients when the analyzed function has some local smoothness properties. This yields compression capabilities that we illustrate by numerical experiments.
In this paper, we deal with the wavelength assignment and the converter placement problem in wavelength-routed optical WDM Mesh networks. Our objective is to try to assign wavelengths in an efficient manner with/without wavelength conversion to get a very low blocking probability and optimize the performance of the overall network. Thus, we implement and compare the performance of two proposed algorithms namely DWA “Dynamic Wavelength Assignment” and SWA “Static Wavelength Assignment” with well-known algorithms. We first present a literature review about previously proposed approaches, and then we introduce and evaluate our implemented approaches. We also discuss the wavelength converter placement problem in mesh networks. We finally corroborate our theoretical findings through extensive simulations.
Traditional cryptography based authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocols expose the problems of efficiency and privacy since signature-then-encryption is heavy to wireless communication special for flexible dynamic deployment, i.e., wireless mesh networks, wireless sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks, etc., in computational cost and communicational overhead and traditional digital signature allows anyone to verify its validity using the corresponding public key. In this paper, we propose a signcryption based light weight key exchange protocol named SLWKE which can provide resistance to traditional attacks, i.e., eavesdropping, deducing, replaying, interleaving, forging and repudiating, and unknown key-share attack and save computational cost by three modular calculations, i.e., one modular inversion, one modular addition and one modular multiplicative, included in a signature s and communicational overhead by secure length of IqI in comparison to signcryption based direct key exchange using a time-stamp protocol termed Dkeuts.
There is an increasing demand for digital crypto-currencies to be more secure and robust to meet the following business requirements: (1) low transaction fees and (2) the privacy of users. Nowadays, Bitcoin is gaining traction and wide adoption. Many well-known businesses have begun accepting bitcoins as a means of making financial payments. However, the susceptibility of Bitcoin networks to information propagation delay, increases the vulnerability to attack of the Bitcoin network, and decreases its throughput performance. This paper introduces and critically analyses new network clustering methods, named Locality Based Clustering (LBC), Ping Time Based Approach (PTBC), Super Node Based Clustering (SNBA), and Master Node Based Clustering (MNBC). The proposed methods aim to decrease the chances of performing a successful double spending attack by reducing the information propagation delay of Bitcoin. These methods embody proximity-aware extensions to the standard Bitcoin protocol, where proximity is measured geographically and in terms of latency. We validate our proposed methods through a set of simulation experiments and the findings show how the proposed methods run and their impact in optimising the transaction propagation delay. Furthermore, these new methods are evaluated from the perspective of the Bitcoin network’s resistance to partitioning attacks. Numerical results, which are established via extensive simulation experiments, demonstrate how the extensions run and also their impact in optimising the transaction propagation delay. We draw on these findings to suggest promising future research directions for the optimisation of transaction propagation delays.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a pervasive wireless technology all around us today. It is included in most commercial consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last years, and billions of BLE-enabled devices are produced every year, mostly wearable or portable ones like smartphones, smartwatches, and smartbands. The success of BLE as a cornerstone in the Internet of Things (IoT) and consumer electronics is both an advantage, enabling short range, low cost, and low power consumption wireless communications, and a disadvantage, from a security and privacy standpoint. BLE exposes packets that enable a potential attacker to detect, enquire and fingerprint actual devices despite manufacturers’ attempts to avoid detection and tracking. Medium Access Control (MAC) address randomization was introduced in the BLE standard to solve some of these issues. In this paper we discuss how to detect and fingerprint BLE devices, basing our analysis and data collection on interactions allowed by the standard. In our study, we propose the Bluetooth Low Energy Nodes Detect, Enquire, (and) Recognition (BLENDER) framework for enumerating and fingerprinting BLE devices for crowd monitoring and recognition purposes, based on four different strategies used to analyze BLE-enabled devices. We will show that it is possible to associate BLE randomized MAC addresses to actual devices. We will then describe a proof of concept for large-scale data collection. In addition, to determine the spots where the stations could be optimally positioned, we created a synthetic dataset based on mobility models and then we emulated the BLENDER approach. The latter allowed training Machine Learning models to predict the expected number of devices appearing at any particular position, day, and hour.
This paper depicts the considered sensor systems which has been made commonsense by the joining of micro electro-mechanical frameworks improvement, remote trades and electronic gadgets. In particular, the distinguishing assignments and the potential sensor systems applications are investigated, and a survey of parts affecting the plan of sensor structures is given. By then, the correspondence essential planning for sensor structures is plot, and the reckonings and customs made for every layer in the composed work are investigated. Open examination issues for the certification of sensor structures are correspondingly examined. Confinement in remote sensor structure acknowledge vital part in making remote correspondence applications. In this paper, RLS confinement estimation figuring is acknowledged with two novel blueprints of focuses in MATLAB. It is observed that the RLS estimation giving better MSPE exclusion emerged from the LLS figuring and the precision of position slip is lessened as the measure of stay focus focuses increments. The delayed consequence of this work would be valuable for growing unfaltering WSN limitation models.
With the rapid deployment of 802.11n networks, the communication in 802.11n network suffers severe interferences. Traditional rate adaptation algorithms do not consider this problem. In this paper, we design a joint rate and channel adaptation scheme called RaCA for dense 802.11n networks. Firstly, we use RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and CSI (Channel Station Information) to measure the current channel conditions. Secondly, we design a two-stage rate adaptation scheme TSRA to quickly adapt to appropriate rate based on RSSI and CSI. Finally, we propose a quorum-based channel adaptation algorithm QCA without control channel. If the channel suffers interferences, RaCA uses QCA to choose another channel to work on. Simulation results show that RaCA obtains significant aggregated throughput gain over Minstrel-HT.
Due to rapid growth in wireless communication, multimedia communication over wireless network attracted researchers. In this field of multimedia communication mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) has proved its significance. MANETs are collection of various communicating nodes without utilizing any fixed infrastructure and network topology. In MANET, mobile nodes can independently be in any direction which causes frequent change in network configuration. Use of multimedia communication is increasing day-by-day which demands high Quality-of-Service for end user experience. MANET suffers from challenges to provide QoS such as dynamic nature of mobile node, limited bandwidth, routing, and contention channel.    In this work, we address the issue QoS in mobile ad hoc network for multimedia applications. In order to improve the quality of service for mobile-ad hoc network, this article presents a combined scheme to maximize the network performance. Proposed approach includes three main aspects such as channel modeling, threshold based data transmission and queuing modeling over physical layer to support quality of service. Channel modeling provides the information about channel such as path loss, Probability density function of channel fading, path gain and probability density function of gain. Later, threshold selection model is implemented to compute the threshold of video packet. With the help of threshold, channel is selected through which video packet has to be transmitted and finally queuing model is developed to reduce communication delay in mobile ad hoc network. Performance of proposed model is computed in terms of throughput, bandwidth efficiency and packet delivery rate and compared with existing approach. Experimental study shows that proposed model is able to perform better when compared to existing approach.
The construction industry is facing enormous pressure to adopt digital solutions to solve the industry's inherent problems. The digital twin has emerged as a solution that can update a BIM model with real-time data to achieve cyber-physical integration, enabling real-time monitoring of assets and activities and improving decision-making. The application of digital twins in the construction industry is still in its nascent stages but has been steadily growing over the past few years. A wide variety of emerging technologies are being used in the development of digital twins in diverse applications in construction but it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are key to the successful development of digital twins, necessitating a systematic literature review with a focus on technologies.

Firstly, this paper describes the basic characteristic, key techniques of Ad Hoc networks, and compared with other mobile communication systems. Through analyzing and comparing with DSR, TORA, ABR, AODV, it researched on-demand routing protocol for Ad Hoc networks. It introduces AODV routing protocol in details. It presents an optimized protocol: B-AODV, based on the shortage of routing finding and routing repair of AODV. In B-AODV, first through reverse request by sending BRREQ replace of RREP, it reduces the time of routing finding. Second, two hops IP record in control messages and route table can improve the rate of routing repair and reduces the times of routing findings. And it improves the function of Ad Hoc network. This simulation experiment is based on NS2 and compared the performance of AODV and B-AODV. And it compared the differences of control packets, ratio of packets, end to end delay for AODV and B- AODV. It shows that B-AODV is better than AODV.
Storing solar-/electro-thermal energy within organic or inorganic phase-change materials (PCMs) is an attractive way to provide stable renewable heating. Herein, we report a facile dynamic charging strategy for rapid harvesting of solar-/electro-thermal energy within PCMs while retaining ∼100% latent heat storage capacity. A bioinspired multifunctional Fe-Cr-Al mesh with high solar absorptance (∼94%), high electrical conductivity (6,622 S/cm), strong corrosion resistance, and high-temperature stability was used as the movable solar-/electro-thermal charger, which can dynamically track the receding solid/liquid interface. Such dynamic charging has demonstrated rapid thermal response (<1 min) and steady fast-charging rates (≥1.1 mm/min), can be driven by low voltage (≤1 V) and low-flux solar illumination (≤500 mW/cm     ), and has achieved a high phase-change solar-thermal (∼90.1%) and electro-thermal (∼86.1%) storage efficiency. The dynamic charging approach is a promising route to efficiently harvest renewable thermal energy from intermittent solar and wind power.       Graphical abstract                                      Dynamic charging for rapid renewable solar-/electro-thermal energy storage        Bioinspired multifunctional Fe-Cr-Al mesh-based solar-/electro-thermal charger        Achieve high energy storage efficiency with full latent heat storage capacity        Applicable for rapid scalable thermal energy storage within diverse PCMs       Progress and potential       Storing solar-/electro-thermal energy within phase-change materials (PCMs) is an attractive way to provide stable, environmentally friendly renewable heating. Herein, a dynamic charging strategy through directly heating a solar-/electro-thermal conversion mesh that tracks the receding melting solid/liquid interface of PCMs is presented to overcome the dilemma in balancing charging rates and latent heat storage capacity in conventional heavily loaded static charging PCM composite systems. Such a dynamic charging strategy simultaneously achieves rapid charging rates, high solar-/electro-thermal energy storage efficiency, and fast thermal response and fully preserves the latent heat storage capacity of PCMs. These desired features together with low-cost advantages and wide applicability in different PCMs could make the dynamic charging system promising for efficiently and conveniently harvesting intermittent solar and wind power into renewable thermal energy.           A bioinspired superhydrophobic solar-absorbing and electrically conductive Fe-Cr-Al mesh-based charger is fabricated to efficiently harvest renewable solar-/electro-thermal energy. Through dynamically tracking the solid-liquid charging interface by the mesh charger, rapid high-efficiency scalable storage of renewable solar-/electro-thermal energy within a broad range of phase-change materials while fully retaining latent heat storage capacity is demonstrated.
A new continuum model for traffic assignment is developed.        The anisotropic impedance of the network is considered.        The present approach is obtained from the discrete formulation.        The formulation leads to a system of non-linear differential equations.        This model yields results similar to those obtained with the discrete approach.              This work deals with a two-dimensional continuum model for the problem of congested traffic assignment in an urban transportation system consisting of a set of freeways superimposed over a dense street network. The formulation leads to a system of non-linear differential equations whose unknowns are given by the travel times from arbitrary points of the network to the corresponding destinations. The governing equations are appropriately solved by means of the Finite Element Method. Then, traffic flow on every link of the network can be obtained. Numerical examples are given in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed model.
In this paper a novel programmable approach to execute implicit routing algorithms is presented. The proposed router is based on an associative scheme that uses the attributes of the routing algorithm and the interconnection network topology. In this approach routing algorithms are mapped (or programmed) onto a set of bit-patterns that are matched in parallel. To show the applicability of this router, we have selected oblivious and fault-tolerant routing algorithms for ten different tree interconnection network topologies; however, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to accommodate other network topologies and routing algorithms. For the studied topologies, the number of required bit-patterns is of the same order as the topology degree. The proposed organization requires only one comparison and one read delays. This in turn yields a high-speed port assignment that is comparable to single topology routers (non-flexible routers). In the context of flexible router schemes, the proposed approach not only is one of the fastest but also requires a very small amount of hardware for its implementation.
This paper applies network tomography for load balancing. Load balancing is the allocation of the work of a single application to processors at run-time so that the execution time of the application is minimized. In order to achieve this purpose, load balancing algorithms require various network parameters to make decisions for effectively balancing the load. This paper analyses the scope of the application of network tomography to facilitate load balancing algorithms in estimating network parameters (packet loss and delay) to be used in decision making. This paper also exploits the interdependence of packet loss and delay in the context of load balancing. Evaluation results show that network tomography estimates link delays accurately from the knowledge of path delays and packet loss. This information is instrumental to be used to tune the delay dependence module of various load balancing algorithms.
Development in the technology of sensor such as Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), wireless communications, embedded systems, distributed processing and wireless sensor applications have contributed a large transformation in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) recently. It assists and improves work performance both in the field of industry and our daily life. Wireless Sensor Network has been widely used in many areas especially for surveillance and monitoring in agriculture and habitat monitoring. Environment monitoring has become an important field of control and protection, providing real-time system and control communication with the physical world. An intelligent and smart Wireless Sensor Network system can gather and process a large amount of data from the beginning of the monitoring and manage air quality, the conditions of traffic, to weather situations. In this paper, we discuss and review wireless sensor network applications for environmental monitoring. In order to implement a good monitoring system, there are several requirements to be followed. From the studies, it has been proved to be an alternative way to replace the conventional method that uses men force to monitor the environment. It is also proven that these approaches can improve the system performance, provide a convenient and efficient method and can also fulfill functional requirements.
Wireless sensors and actuators network application in an existing office building.        Occupancy-based lighting control with wireless sensors and actuators network.        Energy saving potentials of wireless occupancy-based lighting control systems.              Buildings have in recent years been the target of a number of energy efficiency improvement strategies given that they are a major energy end-use sector in most countries. Whilst new buildings due to legislations, increasingly address sustainability and improved energy efficiency considerations, the refurbishment process of older buildings still presents a number of challenges. Advancement in Information and Communication Technology, particularly the application of low-cost Wireless Sensors and Actuators Network does however provide the opportunity to harness yet unrealized energy reduction in existing buildings. This paper presents results from an experimental study evaluating the performance and energy saving potentials of such off-the-shelve, low-cost wireless sensors and actuators network in an existing office building for occupancy detection and occupancy-driven lighting control. The study demonstrates that in addition to improved occupancy information obtainable from Wireless Sensors and Actuators Network, worthwhile savings in the energy consumption of the lighting systems can as well be achieved.
In this paper we present an extensive study of many-to-many routing on trees under the matching routing model. Our study includes on-line and off-line algorithms. We present an asymptotically optimal on-line algorithm which routes      packets to their destination within          − 1) +          routing steps, where      is the degree of tree      on which the routing takes place and      is the maximum distance any packet has to travel. We also present an off-line algorithm that solves the same problem within 2(     − 1) +      steps. The analysis of our algorithms is based on the establishment of a close relationship between the matching and the hot-potato routing models that allows us to apply tools which were previously used exclusively in the analysis of hot-potato routing.
This paper presents a newly developed methodology aimed at assessing at national level the techno-economic potential of district heating (DH) based on renewables and excess heat sources. The novelty of the model lies in the use of an optimization approach to match heat demand and heat sources at large scale level, while keeping a high degree of spatial detail. Areas suitable for DH adoption are identified by minimizing heat delivery costs, and therefore by choosing the most economical technology between district heating and the alternative individual solution. The optimization approach, usually applicable at limited analytical scope because of the computational burden, is here adapted to large scale analysis through the introduction of novel methodological elements with which the network topology is simulated nationwide.    The methodology applies to preliminarily identified maps of available heat sources and eligible heat demand, with the quantification of the latter including retrofitting and low connection rate scenarios. It then consists in two steps: connecting elements in a graph through triangulation and routing algorithms and optimizing connections to minimize the overall heat delivery costs, either by adopting district heating or individual heating systems. The whole methodology is based on open-source data and tools for broad applicability. The paper presents the elaborated methodology together with the application of the entire model to Italy. The outcome is a map of the potential district heating systems identified with significant spatial detail nationwide. A four-fold expansion is envisaged, covering 12% of the national heat demand with renewables- and excess heat- based district heating.

The wireless backhaul has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional fiber backhaul for 5G technology, offering greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness thanks to the availability of high bandwidths capable of achieving fiber-like data rates. However, the millimeter-wave-based (mmWave) protocols, namely IEEE 802.11ad and later IEEE 802.11ay, suffer from a high susceptibility to obstruction, which only allows correct operation under Line-of-Sight conditions (LOS). Any sudden obstructions can significantly reduce the maximum achievable throughput, leading to delays exceeding acceptable limits for critical applications, and may even culminate in link failure in certain circumstances. Therefore, it is essential to assess how different types and durations of obstructions impact different network OSI layers to determine the feasibility of mmWave. WiGig-based technologies for wireless backhaul scenarios. This article describes a dataset collected from an experimental IEEE 802.11ad backhaul network, mmWave-based mesh network at 60 GHz, deployed in an outdoor environment. The data contains multi-layer information, including MAC, PHY, and network data, which provides valuable insights into the WiGig network behavior under three distinct scenarios. These scenarios include normal operation, long-term blocked scenario, and short-term blocked scenario, based on the type and duration of the blockage event crossing the LOS path. The dataset presents an extensive PHY, MAC and transport layer measurement campaign for an outdoor WiGig network, and thus it is a valuable resource for researchers and professionals interested in understanding the behavior and performance of real-life mmWave-based WiGig networks aimed for 5G backhauling.
The Multicast Routing Algorithm (SDSMR) based on state distributed sensor network solves the problem of limiting multicast routing in the wireless sensor network due to parameters such as energy saving ratio and throughput. There are three kinds of nodes in the algorithm: cluster head node (CH), core node (CNs) and sensor node (SNs). The CH node performs topology control routing and monitors the energy state of the sns. The CNS stores multicast routing state information to minimize routing complexity when a link fails. The SNs participates in multicast routing supported by the core node network. It saves energy consumption of the CNs and improves the performance of the entire network. The simulation results show that in SDSMR algorithm, HGMR algorithm and DCAMEM algorithm, SDSMR algorithm can effectively shorten the delay time and improve the energy saving rate and throughput rate.
LoRa technology contributes to green energy by enabling efficient, long-range communication for the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper addresses the challenges related to coverage range in outdoor monitoring systems utilizing LoRa, where the network performance is affected by the density of gateways (GWs) and end devices (EDs), as well as environmental conditions. To mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption, the proposed spreading factor (SF) and hybrid (data rate|SF) models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters. The orchestration of concurrent data modifications within the network server (NS) is crucial for uninterrupted communication between GWs and EDs, especially in monitoring electric vehicle (EV) stations to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Employing K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms optimizes ED allocation, averts data congestion, and improves the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR). These methods ensure seamless information reception by meticulously allocated EDs across various GW combinations. To estimate the free-space losses (FSL), a log-distance path loss model (log-PL) is used. Exploring various bandwidths (BWs), bidirectional communications, and duty cycles (DCs) helps to prevent saturation, thus prolonging the operational lifespan of EDs. Empirical findings reveal a notable packet rejection rate (PRR) of 0% for the DBSCAN (hybrid model). In contrast, the K-means exhibits a PRR ranging from 5% (hybrid model) to 35.29% (SF model) for the ten GWs combination. Notably, the network saturation is reduced to 10.185% and 9.503%, respectively, highlighting an improvement in the average efficiency of slotted ALOHA (91.1%) and pure ALOHA (90.7%). These enhancements increase the lifespan of EDs to 15,465.27 days.       Graphical abstract             Image 1                               This paper addresses the challenges associated with the coverage range of the LoRa-based EV station monitoring system, where the network performance is influenced by the density of GWs and EDs, along with environmental conditions.        SF and hybrid models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters for various combinations of GWs and EDs to mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption.        K-means and DBSCAN are employed to optimize ED allocation, preventing data congestion and enhancing the SINR.        To estimate medium losses, a logarithmic path loss model is utilized. To minimize the network saturation and enhance the operational lifespan of EDs, various BWs, bidirectional communications, and DCs are explored.
Wireless networks have evolved considerably in the recent years thanks to the advancement of technology that has made devices more portable, smarter, and more energy efficient. In particular, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), that are formed without any centralized infrastructure, have received a lot of attention as they can be used in many real life applications. Yet, compared to static wireless networks, less academic research has been done on MANETs, especially when all the nodes are in continuous movement. In particular, we consider MANETs that broadcast HELLO messages at regular time intervals in order to maintain dynamic neigh- borhood information. The range of velocities of the nodes and the HELLO message interval duration can significantly affect the performance of routing protocols in MANETs. In this work, we study the effect of varying these two main characteristics on the performance of MANETs in terms of delivered packets and packets delivery ratio that reflect routing paths stability. We present a comprehensive experimental analysis of the effect of such variations on three position-based stability-oriented routing protocols, namely, Greedy-based Backup Routing (GBR), LEARN-based Backup Routing (LBR), and GBR combined with a Conservative Neighborhood Range (GBR-CNR).
In content based file sharing peer-to-peer (P2P)        network model nodes share files directly with each other without a centralized server. In such a file sharing system, nodes meet and exchange requests and files in the format of text, short videos, and voice clips in different interest categories. Content is various and large file sharing such as the multimedia content is required with the rapid development of the wireless communication technology. File sharing can also mean having an allocated amount of personal file storage in a common file system. A P2P content based file sharing system, for efficient file searching, threshold takes advantage of node mobility by designating stable nodes, which have the most frequent contact with community members, as community coordinators for intra community searching, and highly mobile nodes that visit other communities frequently as community ambassadors for intercommunity searching. The large file sharing needs more stable end to end path and long transmission time. Last but not least, more relationship between nodes will be used to promote the file sharing process. Content based file sharing is helpful for taking certain decisions during file transmission. These decisions will benefit in proper utilization of network resources. In this paper content-based file sharing scheme using threshold is proposed. The user's interest is determined by the proposed scheme before searching and sharing the files in the peer-to-peer network. The resources in the network are utilized as per the contents of the files to be shared. The performance evaluation show that proposed system significantly lowers transmission cost and improves file sharing success rate compared to current methods.
Important scientific and engineering applications need high performance computing. This can be provided by massively parallel computer (MPC) systems. A sensitive step of maintaining such systems is the interconnection network used to interconnect the computing nodes. The topology used effects the network costs and performance significantly. Hierarchal interconnection networks (HIN) were introduced having several attractive features including low latency, low cost, and high fault tolerance. This paper proposes a new HIN called Midimew connect Torus Network (MTN) that provides constant node degree, high arc connectivity, high fault tolerance and a reasonable bisection width. Static network performance evaluation for the proposed MTN has been conducted and compared with other networks. The comparison included conventional topologies such as 2D Mesh and 2D Torus and hierarchal ones which are TESH and TTN. The comparison of result shows that with the cost of extra communication links MTN attains higher fault tolerance than that of TESH and mesh networks, and equal to that of TTN, and less than that of torus network. Also, the hierarchical networks such as MTN, TTN, and TESH yield moderate bisection width; and the bisection width of MTN is lower than that of mesh and torus networks. This paper shows the superiority of the proposed MTN by comparative study of static network performance.
Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) provides multi-hop and multi-path communication by deploying network nodes in form of mesh topology and grasps the attention of research community and industry due to its features like self-healing and self-organizing etc. In multi-hop networks, bandwidth efficiency degrades with the increase in number of intermediate nodes. In this paper, we present a novel encoding scheme at data link layer with the characteristic of cut-through switch. By using the proposed technique, we can increase throughput by reducing re-transmissions in the network. We have verified our proposed method by simulation in NS3. The simulation results indicate that in-spite of high interference, we can achieve improved throughput and less delay with proposed model.
Accurate link quality estimation is a fundamental building block in quality aware multi hop routing. In an inherently lossy, unreliable and dynamic medium such as wireless, the task of accurate estimation becomes very challenging. Over the years ETX has been widely used as a reliable link quality estimation metric. However, more recently it has been established that under heavy traffic loads ETX performance gets significantly worse. We examine the ETX metric's behavior in detail with respect to the MAC layer and UDP data; and identify the causes of its unreliability. Motivated by the observations made in our analysis, we present the design and implementation of our link quality measurement metric xDDR – a variation of ETX. This article extends xDDR to support network mobility. Our experiments show that xDDR substantially outperforms minimum hop count, ETX and HETX in terms of end-to-end packet delivery ratio in static as well as mobile scenarios.
In modern wireless communication systems, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important performance indicators. When the other radio frequency (RF) performance of the components is well designed, passive intermodulation (PIM) interference may become an important factor limiting the system’s SNR. Whether it is a base station, an indoor distributed antenna system, or a satellite system, there are stringent PIM level requirements to minimize interference and enhance network capacity in multicarrier networks. Especially for systems of high power and wide bandwidth such as 5G wireless communication, PIM interference is even more serious. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of PIM, measurement is the most important means to study and evaluate the PIM performance of wireless communication systems. In this review, the current main PIM measurement methods recommended by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and other standard organizations are introduced, and several key challenges in PIM measurement and their solutions (including the design of PIM tester, the location of the PIM sources, the design of compact PIM anechoic chambers, and the evaluation methods of PIM anechoic chambers) are highlighted. These challenges are of great significance to solve PIM problems that may arise during device characterization and verification in real wireless communication systems.
Without integrating various sensor data sets, sensing information in the presence of leakage for large-scale pipeline systems is very challenging. A data fusion methodology, wherein more sensor data is merged to give relevant information, is necessary to transform the challenging process into a straightforward step-by-step operation. Ultrasonic sensors are used in stage 1 to identify any ambiguities in pipeline systems, and various sites are used to gauge the rate of leak detection. As a result, a novel model for estimating various types of gas leakage in pipeline systems is examined, put to the test, and contrasted. Five distinct scenarios are seen during the leakage testing procedure using data fusion, where the optimization is done using the fuzzy interface technique. This integration procedure detects leakage rates with high accuracy, and in every test instance, the best outcomes are obtained. Additionally, the predicted model can be used in real-time with a low failure rate of numerous sensors, with MATLAB being used to simulate the results.
Recently, web service became popular for Real-time Communication (RTC). It allows bi-directional, real-time communication between web clients and server. On the other hand, Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware offers unified integration with high-performance due to its scalability, flexibility, real-time, mission-critical networks and rich QoS features. DDS is based on the publish/subscribe communication model. It improves RTC through its efficient and high-performance data delivery mechanism. This paper studies and investigates that how DDS is better for RTC. Experimental studies are conducted to compare text messaging using socket IO over DDS Web API. The result concerns the throughput satisfaction rate, round trip time and packet loss. In addition, we consider some of QoS of DDS during experimental work e.g. deadline, time based filter etc.
The modern tactical network demands a highly dynamic communications environment that involves autonomous platforms and systems. In order to achieve the full potential of modern technologies, it is critical to ensure the critical data finds the optimum path at the right time in a highly aggressive environment employing secure and best possible available communication path or network resources. Moreover, Contextual information aware optimal communication, such as the power of the radios, battery level, distance among the radios, and maximum and minimum data rates of the radio aware optimal path selection, remains an unresolvable research area. The mentioned limitation engenders various complex challenges in mission-critical networks. Therefore, contextual information-aware optimal communication in radio networks is a priority demand raised as a primary objective for military communication research. In this paper, we have performed a comprehensive review of various proposed methodologies to achieve the objective, followed by a critical comparative analysis to anticipate the state of the mentioned research area that leads to a future research direction for military researchers.
Intrusion is any unwanted activity that can disrupt the normal functions of wired or wireless networks. Wireless mesh networking technology has been pivotal in providing an affordable means to deploy a network and allow omnipresent access to users on the Internet. A multitude of emerging public services rely on the widespread, high-speed, and inexpensive connectivity provided by such networks. The absence of a centralized network infrastructure and open shared medium makes WMNs particularly susceptible to malevolent attacks, especially in multihop networks. Hence, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure privacy, security, and resilience when designing such networks. An effective method to detect possible internal and external attack vectors is to use an intrusion detection system. Although many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) were proposed for Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), they can only detect intrusions in a particular layer. Because WMNs are vulnerable to multilayer security attacks, a cross-layer IDS are required to detect and respond to such attacks. In this study, we analyzed cross-layer IDS options in WMN environments. The main objective was to understand how such schemes detect security attacks at several OSI layers. The suggested IDS is verified in many scenarios, and the experimental results show its efficiency.
The architecture of “mesh of buses” is an important model in parallel computing. Its main advantage is that the additional broadcast capability can be used to overcome the main disadvantage of the mesh, namely its relatively large diameter. We show that the addition of buses indeed accelerates routing times. Furthermore, unlike in the “store and forward” model, the routing time becomes proportional to the network load, resulting in decreasing in routing time for a smaller number of packets. We consider 1–1 routing of    packets in a    -dimensional mesh with        processors and              buses (one per row and column). The two standard models of accessing the buses are considered and compared: CREW, in which only one processor may transmit at any given time on a given bus, and the CRCW model, in which several processors may attempt to transmit at the same time (getting a noise signal as a result). We design a routing algorithm that routes    packets in the CREW model in                          ) steps. This result holds for                    ⩾3 and unconditionally for    =2. A matching lower bound is also proved. In the CRCW case we show an algorithm of                      ) and a lower bound of              ). It is shown that the difference between the models is essentially due to the improved capability of estimating threshold functions in the CRCW case.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks existing on a MANET are a natural evolution since both are decentralized and have dynamic topologies. As MANETs grow in use due to the increasing popularity of wireless mesh and 4G networks, it is expected that P2P applications will remain as a popular means of obtaining files. Network coding has been shown as an efficient means of sharing large files in a P2P network. With network coding, all file blocks have the same relative importance. This paper presents an efficient content distribution scheme that uses network coding to share large files in a P2P overlay running on a MANET. Peers request file blocks from multiple server nodes and servers multicast blocks to multiple receivers, providing efficient multipoint-to-multipoint communication. Simulation results show that compared to other common download techniques, the proposed scheme performs very well, having lower download time and energy consumption. Also, more peers participate in uploading the file, resulting in greater fairness.
Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANET) allow a set of wireless hosts to exchange information without any special infrastructure. The projct entitled “  Energy Optimization in Manets using On-Demand Routing Protocol”   motivates the need for energy management in ad hoc wireless networks. Limited battery power is one of the most important issues in mobile ad hoc network as the mobile nodes operate in limited battery power. Also there occurs a problem of broken links due to the lack of energy which cause disorder in network system. Such problem occurs due to the unawareness of energy of mobile neighbor nodes. This paper presents the implementation of Adaptive HELLO messaging scheme to determine the local link connectivity information for monitoring the link status between nodes along with the incorporation of Dynamic On Demand Routing Protocol to reduce the energy consumption of mobile nodes to certain extent.
The traditional Internet architecture provides applications with a stable end-to-end connection between a requester and a source node holding the information. However, in a vehicular environment, this connection is not stable due to the mobility of vehicles that results in location change, from the requester, the source, or both. To overcome these situations, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed as new architecture for data retrieval and mobility support. This new paradigm enhances content access and dissemination by decoupling the content from its original location. In this paper, we introduce the forwarding in NDN-based VANETs and highlight its benefits and limitations. We propose a classification of NDN-based VANETs forwarding strategies, then detail the representative schemes. Furthermore, we provide a review and comparison of existing forwarding strategies in terms of various attributes such as transmission mode, forwarding strategies, changes of NDN architecture, application scenarios, problem addressed, evaluation metrics, simulation platform. Finally, we conclude our contribution by identifying main open research challenges that can be exploited for future works. We believe that this survey will help NDN-based VANETs researchers community to easily understand the forwarding in vehicular environment, overcome some repeated solutions and gives further inspiration to design a new protocols to improve NDN-based VANETs networks in this context for further relevant research works.
Recently, Non-Terrestrial Satellite Networks (NTSTs) have gained more and more attentions due to global coverage, low latency, and high-speed communications. The routing scheme is one of the primary challenges for NTSNs, due to the mega scale of an NTSN constellation and the dynamic topology feature. To solve many pressing problems, a Compass time-space Model-based Virtual IP (CMVIP) routing scheme is proposed in this paper. In order to compensate for discontinuities in existing topology models, a compass-shaped time-space model is proposed. It can be adapted with Inter-Satellite-Link (ISL) and Ground-Satellite-Link (GSL) transmissions. A distributed algorithm with multiple optimization objectives and multiple constraints is applied for routing path discovery. To more realistically verify the specific scheme, a traffic model that supports two different services is proposed. Access and bearer services are the two main applications of an NTSN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance. In addition, comparison results demonstrate that the CMVIP routing scheme is superior to the Virtual-Topology-based Shortest Path (VT-SP) routing algorithm.
Gossiping is the communication problem in which each node has a unique message to be transmitted to every other node. The nodes exchange their message by packets. A solution to the problem is judged by how many rounds of packet sending it requires. In this paper, we consider the version of the problem in which small-size packets each carrying exactly one message are used. The nodes of the target meshes are assumed to be all-port (a node’s incident edges can all be active at the same time); and their edges are either half-duplex or full-duplex, which are also known as the H* model and the F* model, respectively. We study the class of 2D square meshes. Soch and Tvrdik (SIROCCO’97, pp. 253–265; Tech. rep. DC-97-04, Dept. of CS&E, Czech Technical University) have obtained optimal algorithms for the F* model (for square or nonsquare meshes). Lau and Zhang (IEEE Trans. Parallel Distribut. Syst. 13 (4) (2002) 349–358) have obtained fast algorithms for the H* model. We present optimal algorithms for both models, with the interesting property that they route their messages along the same paths and in the same order, i.e. for any edge                   , the          -th message from                    under either model is the same message.
In dynamic traffic assignment problems, travelers choose routes that minimize their cost of traveling to their destination. In traditional continuum models, travelers have a global perception of traffic; in this study, two novel reactive route-choice strategies are devised in which travelers have a local perception of traffic. In Strategy A, travelers identify a set of feasible temporary destinations that are equidistant from their final destination, and then choose an optimal path within the local perception region that minimizes their cost of traveling to the temporary destination set. In Strategy B, travelers identify a direct path that they can follow to move closer to their final destination within a short, fixed time. These route-choice strategies are used to formulate complete continuum dynamic models for traffic flows in an urban city that consist of a conservation law and a set of eikonal equations or optimization problems involving ordinary differential equations. High-order numerical schemes and suitable solution algorithms are applied to solve these equations on unstructured triangular meshes. Numerical examples are also presented to compare the novel local route-choice strategies with traditional global strategies.                       Two novel local route-choice strategies are devised to study travelers’ behavior.        Complete continuum dynamic models are formulated for traffic flows in a city.        High-order numerical schemes on unstructured triangular meshes are designed.        Some individuals under local strategies may perform better.        Increasing the distance horizon enhances overall traffic efficiency.
Maritime communications with sea surface reflections and sea wave occlusions are susceptible to jamming attacks due to the wide geographical area and intensive wireless communication services. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) help relay messages to improve communication performance, but the relay policy that depends on the rapidly changing maritime environments is difficult to optimize. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based UAV relay policy for maritime communications is proposed to resist jamming attacks. Based on previous transmission performance, the relay location, the received power of the transmitted signal and the received jamming power, this scheme optimizes the UAV trajectory and relay power to save the energy consumption and decrease the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the maritime signals. A deep reinforcement learning-based scheme is also proposed, which designs a deep neural network with dueling architecture to further improve the communication performance and computational complexity. The performance bounds regarding the signal to interference plus noise ratio, energy consumption and the communication utility are provided based on the Nash equilibrium of the game against jamming, and the computational complexity of the proposed schemes is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes improve the energy efficiency and decrease the BER compared with the benchmark.
M communication is information exchange between machines and machines without any human interaction. M2    M communication based on cellular network suffers from the extremely large number of devices in service coverage. In cellular network case, the large number of devices lead to communication problem caused by collisions between the senders. In this work we study the collision probability, saturation throughput and packet error rate for the carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol with request to send and clear to send (RTS/CTS) mechanism in the case of frequency band division. We propose in this paper a modified version of CSMA/CA-RTS/CTS to be compatible with the band repartition technique and we prove that an important gain is introduced in terms of system performance especially for loaded networks. Different backoff stage numbers with different finite retransmission limit values are investigated. Simulations highlight that dividing the RTS band into independent channels reduces drastically the RTS collision probability and in particular the packet error rate. A gain in terms of saturation throughput is also demonstrated especially in charged networks mode.
The community of Lusatian Urnfields participated in the extensive transport and trade in metal.        Metal from the nearest mines was used, as well as from deposits located far away.        A large variety of sources of copper was used for the manufacture of artefacts in one hoard.        Tools of non-local type were produced in the territory of SW Poland.        Stylistic analogies for the artefacts from Paszowice hoard are found mainly in southern regions.               Metal artefacts from Bronze Age hoards have routinely been used to study interregional contacts. Their stylistic and typological features helped distinguish local products and imports by appearance. In the last 40 years, combined lead isotope and chemical analyses of metals have been widely applied to verify hypotheses based on style and typology. This paper is a comprehensive typological and analytical study of a metal item hoard discovered in Paszowice, SW Poland. In the Bronze Age, the area was inhabited by the Lusatian Urnfield culture (ca. 1350/1300–800/750 BC) communities. We expected that at least some of the artefacts would be local products fashioned according to foreign stylistic patterns. The research aimed to determine whether a ‘classical’ stylistic analysis combined with provenance studies of metals would allow more decisive conclusions. This combination of methods could also show how the metal reached the Lusatian Urnfield culture settlement zone. We conducted a detailed typological and chronological analysis to map the distribution of similar artefact types. It demonstrated that stylistic matches for the artefacts from Paszowice occur mainly in NE Hungary, S Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania. Selected metal artefacts (both tin bronze items and raw copper objects) from Paszowice were also analysed for their chemical (EPMA) and lead isotope (MC ICP MS) compositions. The study revealed many copper sources used for their production, ranging from the nearest copper mines in the Slovak Ore Mountains, through Eastern Alps and mines in Sardinia, to possibly the Iberian Peninsula. In this way, we identified the potential trade routes by which metal could get to SW Poland: the southwestern and southeastern routes and the Mediterranean-Danube route. The Iberian metal might have also reached the study area from the north – through its redistribution by Scandinavian traders. Our results show that metal from many sources circulated in central Europe during the Late Bronze Age. The Lusatian Urnfield communities were part of a pan-European exchange network and maintained extensive long-distance contacts, allowing metal acquisition from various sources.
Despite numerous interconnection schemes proposed for distributed multicomputing, systematic studies of classes of interprocessor networks, that offer speed-cost tradeoffs over a wide range, have been few and far in between. A notable exception is the study of Cayley graphs that model a wide array of symmetric networks of theoretical and practical interest. Properties established for all, or for certain subclasses of, Cayley graphs are extremely useful in view of their wide applicability. In this paper, we obtain a number of new relationships between Cayley (di)graphs and their subgraphs and coset graphs with respect to subgroups, focusing in particular on homomorphism between them and on relating their internode distances and diameters. We discuss applications of these results to well-known and useful interconnection networks such as hexagonal and honeycomb meshes as well as certain classes of pruned tori.
While designing a routing protocol energy conservation and interference are two most critical issues in wireless networks - interference is an inherent property that is not easy to control. Yet again, energy conservation is another important parameter as mobile nodes are battery constrained. Nodes consume energy not only for transmitting packets but also for reception of unwanted signal from interfering nodes. Therefore it is necessary to minimize the overall energy consumption of mobile nodes by minimizing both transmission cost and reception cost and which results in prolonging the life time of the entire network. In this paper we propose an interference aware minimum energy routing protocol that considers both transmission power and also the reception power of nodes due to interference. The simulation result shows that the proposed method is more energy saving and load balanced than interference unaware routing protocols.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding in applications ranging from smart homes and smart cities to various other domains, including agriculture, transportation, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. Regardless of the application domain, firmware update over-the-air (FOTA) capability is critical for any IoT network, and its importance is particularly evident in the field of industrial IoT. This paper presents a comprehensive solution designed for large-scale industrial IoT networks, with a special focus on Deterministic Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME)-based multi-hop networks, called DSME-FOTA. The paper provides a detailed FOTA protocol design, a numerical analysis, and proof-of-concept experiments. The analytical and experimental results show that the total firmware update time of DSME-FOTA exhibits a first-order dependence on both the number of hops and the firmware binary size.       Graphical abstract                                      DSME-FOTA enables efficient firmware updates in industrial IoT networks.        Integrates LoRa PHY and IEEE 802.15.4 DSME MAC for versatile network topologies.        Ensures reliable firmware distribution via master-slave operation.        Offers quantitative analysis focusing on FOTA update time.
Combinatorial properties have become more and more important recently in the study of reliability, fault tolerance, randomized routing, and transmission delay in interconnection networks. In this paper, we prove that hypertrees are planar. We also discuss certain combinatorial properties of root-fault hypertrees.
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is an emerging area of research and have been gaining significant attention over recent years due to its role in designing intelligent transportation system. It includes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) message flows, supported by wireless access technology such as, IEEE 1609 WAVE and IEEE 802.11p. One of the major scientific challenge in VANET implementation, is the design of routing protocol that could provide efficient and reliable node-to-node packet transmission. Routing in VANETs is a complex task in urban environment. This paper reports the overall performance evaluation of two existing routing protocols namely, Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for VANETs. This study aims at optimizing the selection of best possible routing protocol for providing reliability to data packet dissemination in an efficient way. The impact and effectiveness of existing topology based routing protocol for VANETs application has been evaluated through the use of NetSim software tool. The simulated results shows that a combination of proper channel model together with an efficient routing protocol enhance the link throughput of the VANET for a fixed network size. Further, performance evaluation also demonstrate the impact of network sizes and routing protocols on packet loss, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and overhead transmission.
Free, open, and neutral network (FONN) is an alternative to the prevailing proprietary ISP networks on the Internet. From the FONN manifesto, we conceive two main goals: to give freedom to users and to cooperate in building and maintaining the FONN infrastructure. However, the manifesto avoids talking about the business model of this infrastructure and neglects to give the appropriate role to each member of the community in building and maintaining this infrastructure. Moreover, current research misplaces FONN’s cooperation in the avoidance of the tragedy of the commons and also overlooks ownership. The move from wireless to fiber has amplified the consequences of not considering ownership or member roles. In order to fill the previous gaps, in this article we will first relate the objectives of this manifesto to the field of free software. Next we will argue that FONN’s cooperation should be placed in the avoidance of the tragedy of the anticommons. Inspired by free software we define a new business model for FONN besides discussing different ownership licenses. Furthermore, we state the roles of members and rigorously model the economic flow of construction and maintenance costs. The main implication of the proposed business model is that future FONNs will avoid the economic and organizational collapse of some current FONN communities, mainly because funding cannot be based solely on crowdfunding or volunteering. Yet, as an overall benefit, FONN avoids the duplication of infrastructure. This new business model has been used successfully in the fiber deployment of a FONN section.
A smart power system demands a strong and self-healing communication system with greater capacity. In China, as the ultra high voltage transmission lines and large scale interconnected grids are expanding throughout the nation, disaster-tolerant communication network is essential for reliable system operation and control. In this paper, we propose a hybrid communication network utilizing both terrestrial and satellite links to improve the system reliability. The adaptive link selection protocol at network layer is developed to facilitate the network integrity. A modification of transport protocol over satellite communication is also proposed to better exploit the limited bandwidth resources. The performance analysis and field trial of the proposed scheme based on the practical network configuration in Sichuan power grid is thoroughly studied. The results showed a great bandwidth saving of satellite resources without loss of network integrity.
A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is used to monitor an area for events. Each node in the WSN has a sensing range and a communication range. The sensing coverage of a sensor node is the area determined by the sensing range of the sensor node. Sensing coverage of the network is the collective coverage of the sensor nodes in a WSN. Sufficient number of sensor nodes need to be deployed to ensure adequate coverage of a region. Further, since sensor nodes have limited battery life, it is also essential to reduce the energy consumption. This would help improve the network lifetime and thus the coverage lifetime. To reduce energy consumption in the WSN, some of the nodes with overlapping sensing areas could be turned off using a coverage optimization protocol. In this paper, we discuss various coverage optimization protocols. These protocols are broadly classified as          protocols. Further, these protocols are classified based on the type of sensing model used, node location information, and mechanism used to determine neighboring node information (based on probe or computational geometry). In this paper, we review the key coverage optimization protocols and present open research issues related to energy efficient coverage.
QoS is an arguable feature of Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT) that is employed under constrained environment for communication over an unreliable network in smart cities. It gives extra control to the client for matching its needs according to the application but with confiscated network performance. For a reliable end-to-end service assurance, guaranteed QoS and controlled scalability, MQTT based IoT must be examined for various network parameters. In this work, an improved TCP based transparent MQTT network is proposed for massively deployed connected devices in smart cities. The mathematical modeling is carried out by analyzing end-to-end quality assurance. Network latency, content delivery rate, number of subscribe/publish requests and services offered by the MQTT broker for various topic IDs are then verified on physical network. These parameters are examined over a transparent gateway-based network for verifying the agreement of devised probability based mathematical model with the actual content delivery, service rate and request hold time at virtual machine based MQTT broker, local network broker and remote server respectively. The Improved MQTT model surpasses Apollo, RabbitMQ and Mosquitto server by evidencing the message queueing delay of 3.5 ms for QoS-0 and 3.6 ms for QoS-1 service IoT.
Modified method for calculating is designed.        This method can increase the level of automation.        The algorithm for calculating the specific trees complex directed graph.               The author of this research developed a modified topological method for calculating distribution coefficients of main currents. Main currents are represented as functions of electrical network parameters based on possible trees of directed graphs. Algorithms can be realized in the MATLAB environment. This method can increase load automation of complex electrical networks and systems.
The lack of internet access in underdeveloped nations, including the Philippines, has significant impact on the digital divide. One of the challenges faced by students in underdeveloped nations, particularly those in far-flung and hinterland schools, is the lack of access to up-to-date educational resources due to their geographic isolation. This can lead to a significant disadvantage in terms of academic performance and future opportunities. Thus, a Remote Learning Management System (RLMS) is proposed. The study includes the development and testing of the RLMS system, as well as an evaluation of its acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model survey questionnaire. This system utilizes intranet networks and a Network File System to provide distant learning and teaching-based eLearning in far-flung and hinterland schools. The system intends to make sharing educational resources easier, such as to let students access their lessons, modules, and assignments, take exams and quizzes and even watch video lessons on their laptops, smartphones, and tablets, even without an internet connection. The results show that the RLMS system is fully functional and accessible, with positive acceptance and intention to use from teachers and students. Future studies can focus on enhancing the RLMS capabilities, improving user-friendliness, and providing in-depth training to teachers to maximize the system's potential. Overall, the RLMS system provides a viable alternative for blended learning in areas with slow and limited internet access.
We present a model of a mobile ad-hoc network in which nodes can move arbitrarily on the plane with some bounded speed. We show that without any assumption on some topological stability, it is impossible to solve the geocast problem      despite connectivity and no matter how slowly the nodes move. Moreover, even if each node maintains a stable connection with each of its neighbors for some period of time, it is impossible to solve the geocast problem if nodes move too fast. Additionally, we give a tradeoff lower bound which shows that the faster the nodes can move on a monodimensional space, the more costly it would be to solve the geocast problem. We provide geocasting algorithms for the case where nodes move in one dimension and also when they can move on the plane (i.e., in two dimensions). We prove correctness of our algorithms by giving exact bounds on the speed of movement. Our analysis helps understand the impact of speed of nodes, firstly, on geocasting solvability and, secondly, on the cost of geocasting.
The single planar routing protocol has a slow convergence rate in the large-scale Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Although the hierarchical routing protocol can effectively cope with large-scale application scenarios, how to elect a secure cluster head and balance the network load becomes an enormous challenge. In this paper, a Trust Management-based and ​Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy protocol (LEACH-TM) is proposed. In LEACH-TM, by using the number of dynamic decision cluster head nodes, residual energy and density of neighbor nodes, the size of the cluster can be better constrained to improve energy efficiency, and avoid excessive energy consumption of a node. Simultaneously, the trust management scheme is introduced into LEACH-TM to defend against internal attacks. The simulation results show that, compared with LEACH-SWDN protocol and LEACH protocol, LEACH-TM outperforms in prolonging the network lifetime and balancing the energy consumption, and can effectively mitigate the influence of malicious nodes on cluster head selection, which can greatly guarantee the security of the overall network.
Ensuring reliable energy efficient data communication in resource constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is of primary concern. Traditionally, two types of re-transmission have been proposed for the data-loss, namely, End-to-End loss recovery (E2E) and per hop. In these mechanisms, lost packets are re-transmitted from a source node or an intermediate node with a low success rate. The proliferation routing      for QoS provisioning in WSNs low End-to-End reliability, not energy efficient and works only for transmissions from sensors to sink. This paper proposes a Reliable Proliferation Routing with low Duty Cycle [RPRDC] in WSNs that integrates three core concepts namely, (i) reliable path finder, (ii) a randomized dispersity, and (iii) forwarding. Simulation results demonstrates that packet successful delivery rate can be maintained upto 93% in RPRDC and outperform Proliferation Routing
This paper presents a study on the usage landscape of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in the architecture, engineering and construction sectors, and proposes a research agenda to address the existing gaps in required capabilities. A series of exploratory workshops and questionnaires were conducted with the participation of 54 experts from 36 organisations from industry and academia. Based on the data collected from the workshops, six AR and VR use-cases were defined: stakeholder engagement, design support, design review, construction support, operations and management support, and training. Three main research categories for a future research agenda have been proposed, i.e.: (i) engineering-grade devices, which encompasses research that enables robust devices that can be used in practice, e.g. the rough and complex conditions of construction sites; (ii) workflow and data management; to effectively manage data and processes required by AR and VR technologies; and (iii) new capabilities; which includes new research required that will add new features that are necessary for the specific construction industry demands. This study provides essential information for practitioners to inform adoption decisions. To researchers, it provides a research road map to inform their future research efforts. This is a foundational study that formalises and categorises the existing usage of AR and VR in the construction industry and provides a roadmap to guide future research efforts.
We give nearly optimal algorithms for matrix transpose on meshes with wormhole and XY routing and with a 1-port or 2-port communication model. For an          mesh, where      = 3 · 2       and each mesh node has a submatrix of size      to be transposed, our best algorithm takes about      time steps. The lower bound is     . While there is no previously known algorithm for matrix transpose on meshes with wormhole and XY routing, a naive algorithm, which is naturally adapted from the well-known Recursive Exchange Algorithm, has a complexity of about     . That is our best algorithm improves over the naive algorithm by about a factor of 3.27, and is about a factor of 3.414/3.27 of the lower bound.
The optical multi-mesh hypercube (OMMH) network is studied.        Some interesting properties of the OMMH network are presented.        The conditional diagnosabilities of the OMMH networks are determined.              Due to integrated positive features of both hypercubes and tori, optical multi-mesh hypercube (OMMH) networks are regarded as a class of promising optical interconnection topologies. The notion of conditional diagnosability helps enhance the self-diagnosing capability of multicomputers. This paper determines the conditional diagnosabilities of OMMH networks under the Maeng–Malek comparison model.
The paper deploys an adaptive provisioning algorithm to the traffic with huge volume of high priority connection requests with long holding time by proposing a novel SLA-aware mechanism over optical shared mesh networks. The contribution presented in this paper follows three main characteristics: i) Proposing a new time-aware traffic engineering path constraint considering holding time of connections in addition to the availability, ii) Introducing a novel provisioning algorithm considering the proposed path attribute, and iii) Applying a high volume of high- priority dynamic traffic with long duration to the introduced mechanism in a new simulation environment to prove its effectiveness. The proposed mechanism benefits from dynamic service level agreement negotiation between a customer and service providers to buffer and further process the potentially blocked high priority connection requests. The simulation results show reduced blocking probability, increased availability satisfaction rate, decreased resource overbuild, and better resource utilization to preserve the high priority class of traffic compared to other SLA-aware algorithms and protection schemes in shared mesh optical networks.
Packet routing is an important problem in parallel computation since a single step of interprocessor communication can be thought of as a packet routing task. In this paper we present an optimal algorithm for packet routing on a mesh-connected computer. Two important criteria for judging a routing algorithm are (1) its   run time  , i.e., the number of parallel steps it takes for the last packet to reach its destination, and (2) its   queue size  , i.e., the maximum number of packets that any node will have to store at any time during routing. We present a 2     − 2 step routing algorithm for an          MIMD mesh that requires a queue size of only 112. The previous best known result is a routing algorithm with the same time bound but with a queue size of 1008. The time bound of 2     − 2 is optimal. A queue size of 1008 is rather large for practical use. We believe that the queue size of our algorithm is practical. The improvement in the queue size is possible due to (among other things) a new sorting algorithm for the MIMD mesh.
Analysis of the current and potential convergence between power grids and mobile communications in multiple, different power grid evolution scenarios created by using a formal scenario planning process.        Power grids and communications can be expected to become more tightly integrated.        Mobile communications and cloud computing are key enablers in the most transformative consumer-centric and grid-management-centric power grid scenarios.        Beyond-5G features are required both for the evolutionary and the most transformative scenarios.        Both the power grid and the communications industries deal with networked infrastructures. Thus, in the future, similarities could also be expected in the business model evolution of these two industries.              This paper focuses on the evolution of the Finnish power grid until 2035 and the role of mobile communications networks in this evolution. It outlines alternative futures (i.e. scenarios) and identifies the role of mobile communications networks in these scenarios. The paper uses an established scenario planning process and a group of experts to determine three scenarios for the evolution of services offered to customers in a future electricity system and four scenarios describing the evolution of grid management. Finally, the role of mobile communications (cellular networks) is analyzed in each of the scenarios. Results show that mobile networks can serve as a key enabler in those scenarios where smart grid evolution would be the most transformative.
The recent academic research surrounding indoor positioning systems (IPS) and indoor location-based services (ILBS) are reviewed to establish the current state-of-the-art for IPS and ILBS. This review is focused on the use of IPS / ILBS for cyber-physical systems to support secure and safe asset management (including people as assets), exploring the potential applications of IPS for industry as suggested in the literature. Current application areas in industry are presented, separated into physical item and human traceability applications for context. The literature are reviewed to identify gaps in the ILBS development for industrial applications, future research needs to focus a development framework to enable scalable solutions for industry. The key gaps identified in the literature are: (i) a lack of pathways to extend IPS research into an ILBS, (ii) no end-to-end ILBS have been developed and (iii) no framework has been reported that outlines the information pathways from sensor data collection and location information to an established ILBS. The technologies reviewed are presented in a comparison table (Table 1) intended as a reference for selecting technologies for future systems based on requirements. The techniques used to extract location information from each of the technologies identified are also explored stating current accuracy and aligning the techniques with their suitable technologies.
This work talks about an attempt to create a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork with Android smartphones. We used FBaodv to manage the networks and some bash script to share informations within the networks. MANET was tested by simple applications to view local neighbors, to send sms over the networks.
Adaptive multi-route query processing (AMR) is an emerging paradigm for processing stream queries in highly fluctuating environments. The content of stream data can be unpredictable. Thus, instead of selecting a fixed plan, AMR dynamically routes batches of tuples to operators in the query network based on up-to-date system statistics. The workload of query access patterns in AMR systems is ever changing. Selecting a single best index may not efficiently support all query access patterns at all times. While maintaining multiple indices to match a variety of query access patterns increases overhead and decreases throughput. Index design, while paramount for efficient query execution, is particularly challenging in AMR systems as the indices must serve the continuously evolving query access patterns. Our proposed Adaptive Multi-Route Index (AMRI) employs a bitmap time-partitioned design that serves a diverse ever changing workload of query access patterns and remains lightweight in terms of maintenance and storage requirements. We propose a high quality yet efficient assessment method modeled after hierarchical heavy hitters that exploits route relationships by modeling the frequency of the search access patterns used as nodes in a lattice. We also design assessment scheduling methods for AMRI based upon detecting changes in the search access patterns used. Our AMRI incorporates migration strategies that seek to meet the needs of both old partially serviced and new incoming search requests. Our experimental study using both synthetic and real data streams demonstrates that AMRI strikes a balance between effectively supporting dynamic stream environments while keeping the index overhead to a minimum. Using an environmental data set collected in the Intel Berkeley Research lab, our AMRI produced on average            more cumulative throughput than the state-of-the-art approach.           ► Our index supports partially serviced and incoming search requests via a time-partitioned index structure. ► We prove that the effect of statistic compaction on the potential loss of quality of the selected index can be bound. ► Our Triggered method schedules assessment on states with observed routing shifts. ► Our Partial Migration strategy migrates only some stored tuples based on their estimated future use.
Achievements from conducted research as part of the team of the Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Transportation (LICIT) of IFSTTAR are integrated in platforms in order to develop and test new modules directly on real data. The ARCHIPEL platform focuses on data assimilation and fusion from multiple sources. The objective of ARCHIPEL is therefore to provide tools to process real-time data from different sources. This platform allows one to test and compare different approaches of assimilation and data fusion: loops, GPS, Bluetooth. Besides it offers to view details of traffic conditions in the form of space-time diagram on accurate and successive areas or larger areas by traficolor representation. In the context of ISpace&Time project, the city of Paris has been finely modelled in a traffic simulator developed by the LICIT, called SymuVia. This permits to have access to a case study in which we know all vehicle positions. In order to explore which fusion method is the most suitable depending on the context e.g. penetration rate and data noises, this realistic data has been put in the platform database and is utilized to give a complete overview of the more relevant methodology to apply. In this work, we propose some fusion scenarios and present the comparison results with respect to different conditions. The final aim is to give a roadmap of the more accurate solutions, since the ground truth is exactly known.
This paper proposes a new localization algorithm THFL (Two-Hop Focus Localization) for wireless sensor network (WSN). This algorithm focuses the localization area of nodes in WSN by using the anchor nodes communicating directly and two-hop with unknown nodes. The advantage of this algorithm is that no additional hardware is needed, and the localization accuracy of classic range-free localization is improved obviously. From the simulation of this algorithm, we get the expected results.
Animal intrusion is a major threat to the productivity of the crops, which affects food security and reduces the profit to the farmers. This proposed model presents the development of the Internet of Things and Machine learning technique-based solutions to overcome this problem. Raspberry Pi runs the machine algorithm, which is interfaced with the ESP8266 Wireless Fidelity module, Pi Camera, Buzzer, and LED. Machine learning algorithms like Region-based Convolutional Neural Network and Single Shot Detection technology plays an important role to detect the object in the images and classify the animals. The experimentation reveals that the Single Shot Detection algorithm outperforms than Region-based Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. Finally, the Twilio API interfaced software decimates the information to the farmers to take decisive action in their farm field.
The development of public transport networks in polycentric regions involves making complex trade-offs between extending network coverage, densifying local connections, offering improved connections between urban centers and increasing capacity on existing links. Moreover, different modalities might be suitable for each of these development decisions depending on their speed, capacity and cost function structure. The objective of this study is to identify the influence of polycentric configurations and their respective travel demand distributions on the emerging topology of the corresponding multi-modal public transport network using an iterative growth model. Since polycentricity comes in many forms, our experimental design considers four polycentric configurations inspired by the cases of London, Tokyo, the Flemish Diamond and the Rhine-Ruhr area.    The results are analysed in terms of both the properties of the obtained network structure as well as the evolutionary path and the sensitivity of both to key model settings and design variables. We find that more uneven population distributions result with the construction of fewer links and consequently the less connected and shorter the network becomes. The network evolutionary path is marked by distinctive intra- and inter- agglomeration expansion, densification and bulking phases. While the costs associated with each investment are the same regardless of the moment at which the investment is made, the benefits are not. This path dependency means that the evolutionary path is characterized by the need to attain a critical mass to justify further developments.
The paper investigates how the level of re-provisioning of lightpaths can affect the calculation of the cost of lightpaths and consequently the result of routing decisions. The paper introduces a re-provisioning mechanism with partial re-routing capabilities to lower the Co2 emission rate while it provides the most available routes between any pair of source and destination. The paper provides a thorough analysis of adaptive green routing mechanism by establishing a partial re-provisioning environment to analyze how the re-provisioning level can affect Co2 emission level, blocking rate, and resource allocation.
Sensor network is a notion denoting an interesting subset of self-organising wireless networks. These networks are rather dense as each node have typically more than dozen neighbours, and large – with tens to hundreds thousands of nodes. Applications of such networks assume distributed environmental sensing performed by each sensor in the network, where data from a particular sensor gain value only when combined with data from a relatively high number of other sensors. One of the open security questions in this specific environment is a possibility to lower requirements on key distribution and key management and thus decrease production costs. One of the possible ways is “key infection”. The paper recaps a protocol and already published results. It also elaborates the concept of key infection by introducing a new variant of security amplification protocol, and presents some interesting results obtained by simulations.
The area of Wireless Sensor Network is one of the fastest growing fields in the communication and engineering world. The main objective of WSN is to sense the crucial information from the environment depending on the type of application for which it is deployed and send this information to its Base Station(BS) so that it can take corrective action. These Sensor Nodes ommunicate with each other through various protocols. The problem of the conventional method is, during gathering of sensed data each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station for which it will deplete its power quickly. In this project, we propose PEGASIS(Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System),a near optimal chain-based protocol for extending the lifetime of network. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbour, performing a chain, elect a leader from the chain who collects the data from the neighbours to be transmitted to the base station. As a result the average energy spend by each node per round is reduced and to lower the bandwidth requirement. By using certain algorithm we can propose the shortest path of transmission of data to the base station. As a result less power consumption can be achieved to increase efficiency and life time of the network.
An adaptive control scheme is proposed for the transmission of packets burst in all-optical Burst Switching network. Two levels of control have been considered: one at the triggering level for a wavelength request, and the other at the burst length level. It is believed that the proposed scheme improves both the provided QoS and the class separation in the wavelength-routed optical network. A comparative study with two other schemes will be undertaken, followed by a study of the effects of the triggering policy. Performance results under various network conditions and dynamic bursty traffic will be presented.
A privacy issue regarding social networks nowadays is the fact that users’ posted data is stored on company-owned servers, adding a third person in between the sender and the receiver. We propose Square Pigeon, an android application which offers a fresh take on the traditional social network model. A server is used for all administrative and coordination overhead to lighten the load off the mobile devices. Security and privacy are provided through bypassing the server and using a p2p network to send all shared data. The use of mobile devices as a main platform presents resource constraints, such as energy efficiency and quota availability, and reliability constraints since we need to offer an acceptable QoS compared to current social networks. Sending data p2p decreases the QoS, but this is compensated by the added security. A performance analysis for transmission rates and delays is therefore conducted.
This paper presents a dynamic inter-domain negotiation mechanism over green optical networks. The proposed propagation mechanism disseminates the source types of energies to all nodes while it advertises a proposed path attribute called minimum path emission. The paper shows how the dynamic negotiation protocol along with the proposed traffic engineering metric improves the performance of green algorithms. This mechanism helps service providers to control the network Co2 emission level in WDM networks and keep the network as green as possible.
This paper deals with congestion and interference control in wireless sensor networks (WSN), which is essential for improving the throughput and saving the scarce energy in networks where nodes have different capacities and traffic patterns. A scheme called       Interference-Aware Congestion Control  ) is proposed. It allows maximizing link capacity utilization for each node by controlling congestion and interference. This is achieved through fair maximum rate control of interfering nodes in inter and intra paths of hot spots. The proposed protocol has been evaluated by simulation, where the results rival the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of energy saving and throughput. In particular, the results demonstrate the protocol scalability and considerable reduction of packet loss that allow to achieve as high packet delivery ratio as 80% for large networks.
Based on the recent studies, by 2020 devices connected to internet are predicted to increase up to 22 billion. In compliance with the rapid growth of internet of things (IoT), Low power wide area Network (LPWA) technologies play a big role in connecting billions of devices. This paper aims to analyze the existing standard NB-IoT, LORA, Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) used as low power wide area Network (LPWA) in wireless network, in term of their power efficiency, QoS, cost and coverage distance. The outcome of the research shows that each technology presents its advantages and disadvantages based on the type of the application considered. It is shown that despite the improvement of researches on existing LPWA technologies, there are still issues that need to be addressed. Thus, this paper gives some open issues for future research.
A distributed network monitoring system has been designed and implemented for smart monitoring of complex indoor wireless environments to support management of wireless communications. In particular, it makes possible real-time monitoring and analysis in smart factories using commodity hardware and open-source software. The system collects data from distributed wireless receivers, aggregates the data in spatial cells and time bins, and computes space-time wireless metric data frames. A prototype monitoring system was implemented with two types of wireless interface sensors, packet-capture and spectral sensors, and automatic online data collection, indexing, aggregation and analysis. The prototype system reports wireless quality metrics with one-meter spatial resolution and periodic update times of 1 to 10 seconds.
Fungal bifunctional terpene synthases (BFTSs) catalyze the formation of numerous di-/sester-/tri-terpenes skeletons. However, the mechanism in controlling the cyclization pattern of terpene scaffolds is rarely deciphered for further application of tuning the catalytic promiscuity of terpene synthases for expanding the chemical space. In this study, we expanded the catalytic promiscuity of   Fusarium oxysporum   fusoxypene synthase (FoFS) by a single mutation at L89, leading to the production of three new sesterterpenes. Further computational analysis revealed that the reconstitution of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) network of second-shell residues around the active site of FoFS influences the orientation of the aromatic residue W69 within the first-shell catalytic pocket. Thus, the dynamic orientation of W69 alters the carbocation transport, leading to the production of diverse ring system skeletons. These findings enhance our knowledge on understanding the molecular mechanisms, which could be applied on protein engineering terpene synthases on regulating the terpene skeletons.
5G networks have strict constraints regarding the services in terms of latency, reliability, and availability, which pose additional challenges to the traditional orchestration solutions, and 6G networks will increment the number of slices and services deployed over different technological domains, adding more difficulties for the orchestrator. Distributed and automated solutions will be essential for this context. This article identifies the main challenges in 5G/6G orchestration and then describes the utility of Artificial Intelligence-driven solutions, outlining an orchestrator architecture for 5G networks. The architecture is then explored as an orchestration solution for two ongoing research projects focused on the deployment of critical services over 5G networks.

Community mesh networks have emerged rapidly in every metropolis around the world, however many of the security methods applied are counter-intuitive and usually disrupt the autonomous characteristics of the mesh nodes. In SOMA we present a structured Peer-to-Peer solution providing authentication service based on a scalable, self-organized and fully distributed Web-of-Trust. Our proposal is a hybrid Public Key Infrastructure build on top of Chord, allowing each agent to place its own trust policy while keeping the autonomous characteristics of the nodes intact. Our goal is to create a large-scale authentication system for mesh networks without the need of a Trusted Third Party. We leave the decision of whom to trust in each agent independently taking advantage of the overlay to alleviate the shortcomings of traditional Web-of-Trust models. This is achieved by using the overlay as a meta-structure to infer trust relationships providing a policy-based system, which is further enhanced with a Bayesian reputation based model so as to cope with the different challenges posed by the distributed nature of the system. The possible attacks and limitations of our proposal are also investigated and discussed.
Energy systems monitoring is a key factor in reducing global energy consumption. Although intrusive approaches can be adopted, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which targets estimation of individual-appliance consumption from aggregated electricity measurements, is the main choice for retrofitting the plethora of non-smart electrical installations. Contemporary NILM requirements include high-frequency power-line sampling, efficient disaggregation algorithms that can, potentially, run locally, on the monitoring device, to offload the remote fog/cloud infrastructure, and various open datasets to allow the development of such algorithms. Towards all these directions, in this paper, a versatile monitoring device to support NILM research is presented. It offers high sampling frequency, sufficiency of local resources, and has been designed to be used in different environments (residential, commercial, industrial). Actually, it was deployed in all these environments, with multiple copies of it being used in two different industrial facilities for over two years. The developed device’s cost has been kept low, its accuracy has been experimentally verified to be sufficiently high, while its key hardware characteristics, in the context of NILM research, compare favorably with those of other devices in the literature. Along with the device, a residential, high-frequency dataset is also presented and made publicly available.
Energy efficient and reliable communication is extremely crucial in most of the applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). Communication between sensor nodes is the major energy guzzler that limits the network lifetime and hence, disrupt WBAN's operation. Moreover, unreliability in wireless communication caused by the channel impairments, such as shadowing and fading, further exacerbate the situation. This paper presents a new three-stage cooperative relaying scheme which proves to be energy efficient and reliable for WBANs. Analytical expressions for the Energy Efficiency (EE) and Packet Error Rate (PER) are also derived in this study.
This paper introduces a location-based locating strategy for Personal Communication Services (PCS) systems. In the proposed scheme, location updates are based on the value of a movement counter. The update of the movement counter is based on information on the locations visited by a mobile terminal (MT) since the last location update. In particular, the cell identifiers and the corresponding movement counter values are maintained in the MT for a part of the visited cells since the last location update. When the MT enters a cell whose identifier is not stored in the MT, the movement counter increases by one. If the movement counter reaches the update threshold, a location update is triggered; otherwise, the cell identifier and the corresponding movement counter value are stored in the MT. When the MT enters a cell whose identifier is in the MT, the movement counter is assigned with the counter value kept in the MT for this cell, and all cells with greater counter values in the MT are removed. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic selection of the update threshold according to each user's calling and mobility patterns. Analytical and simulation models have been developed to compare the proposed scheme with both the movement-based scheme and the distance-based scheme. Results demonstrate that when the call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) is low, the proposed scheme can achieve a significant cost reduction compared to the movement-based scheme. For example, when the CMR is 0.01, a savings of around 25% in the optimal total cost per call arrival is achieved with the proposed scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme is easier to implement than the distance-based scheme.
In this paper, we presented a novel design for a distributed multimedia communications network. We introduced the distributed tactic, flow procedure and particular structure. We also analyzed its scalability, stability, robustness, extension, and transmission delay of this architecture. Finally, the result shows our framework is suitable for very large scale communications.
Multistage networks are finding increasing use in building clusters of workstations and PCs. The networks that support such connectivity must provide high bandwidth, low latency, scalability, low cost, high level of usability, and reliability [1]. A key parameter that influences the network performance characteristics such as maximum latency, throughput, scalability and tree saturation, is the arbitration policy implemented in routers.
In today’s world, it is vital to have strong cybersecurity measures in place. To combat the ever-evolving threats, adopting advanced models like cybersecurity mesh is necessary to enhance our protection. Cybersecurity mesh is an architecture scalable, flexible, composable, robust and resilient and allows the interoperability and coordination between intelligent systems to provide security services. Designing a cybersecurity mesh faces three major challenges: scalability, distributed or federated systems, and technology integration. For the design, it is necessary to apply security tools that support scalability because millions and millions of data are stored, processed, and analysed. Federated systems are needed to improve interoperability in a decentralized cybersecurity mesh. However, it can be tough to integrate different security tools and communication protocols. Cryptographic algorithms and AI models like federated learning, swarming intelligence and blockchain technologies are useful for security services. It is essential to study the integration of existing methods to determine the best technology for the job. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of intelligent systems, including federated learning, blockchain technology, and swarming intelligence, with a particular focus on how they have been and can be used to enhance cybersecurity. We examine the latest trends in these technologies, explore their connections, and weigh the pros and cons of each approach. To conduct this review, we utilized the Web of Science and Scopus databases and followed the PRISMA guidelines.
New approaches to visualise evolution of traffic congestions in large size cities such as London.        Enable identifying dispersion and dissipation of congestion on the entire road network.        Allow seeing dispersion and dissipation of congestion at the link level.               Visualisation is an effective tool for studying traffic congestion using massive traffic datasets collected from traffic sensors. Existing techniques can reveal where/when congested areas are formed, developed, and moved on one or several highway roads, but it is still challenging to visualise the evolution of traffic congestion on the whole road network, especially on dense urban networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three 3D exploratory visualisation techniques: the isosurface, the constrained isosurface, and the wall map. These three techniques have different advantages and should be combined to leverage their respective strong points. We present our visualisation techniques with the case of link travel time data from Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) in London.
The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management.                        The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed.        Internet of Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven.        Implementation and application are described in depth.        Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are discussed thoroughly.
Aiming at establishing secure access and communications for a multi-operator wireless mesh network (WMN), this paper proposes a localized efficient authentication scheme (LEAS) under a broker-based hierarchical security architecture and trust model. Mutual authentication is achieved directly between mesh client and access mesh router through a ticket which is equipped with an identity-based proxy signature. Fast authentication for different roaming scenarios is supported by using HMAC operations on both the mesh client side and mesh router side. As a byproduct, key agreement among network entities is also implemented to protect the subsequent communications after authentication. Our performance and security analysis demonstrate that LEAS is efficient and resilient to various kinds of attacks.
Mobile edge computing emerges as a new paradigm to provide low-latency network services in the close proximity to users. Based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology, network services can be flexibly provisioned as service function chain (SFC) deployed at edge servers. In some scenarios, such as the vehicular or UAV-assisted edge computing, the network topology varies rapidly due to the mobile edge servers, which changes the routing path between adjacent VNFs in an SFC. Migrating SFC to adapt to the frequent topology change can reduce the SFC latency, and improve the quality of users’ experience. However, frequent SFC migration will unavoidably increase the operation cost. In this paper, to optimize the system performance in a cost-efficient manner, we study the SFC migration problem in dynamic networks with a long-term cost budget constraint. We then propose the Topology-aware Min-latency SFC Migration (TMSM) method to strike a desirable balance between the SFC latency and the migration cost. Specifically, we first apply the Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time optimization sub-problems. Since the decomposed problem is still NP-hard, a Markov approximation based heuristic is proposed to seek a near-optimal solution for each sub-problem. Compared with the rerouting-only strategy, which does not migrate any VNF, our TMSM reduces the latency by at least 21% on average in each time slot. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better tradeoff between the SFC latency and migration cost than the baselines.
Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) have been introduced in the telecommunications engineering as a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services. Working together, they are able to consolidate and deliver the networking components using standard IT virtualization technologies making, in such a way, carriers infrastructures more flexible and adaptive in respect to the needs of both end-users and service providers.    In this context, this paper presents the architecture and the related prototype of a video broadcasting service tailored for SDN-NVF enabled networks, allowing network and application functions deployment simplification and management cost reduction. In such a way, the proposed solution enables small/medium and unusual content providers to share events with a restricted number of interested users without the need of adopting a dedicated and expensive data delivery infrastructure.
Timely detection of anomalous activity in wireless sensor network is critical for the smooth working of the network. This paper presents an intrusion detection technique based on the calculation of trust of the neighboring node. In the proposed IDS, each node observes the trust level of its neighboring nodes. Based on these trust values, neighboring nodes may be declared as trustworthy, risky or malicious. Trustworthy nodes are recommended to the forwarding engine for packet forwarding purposes. The proposed scheme successfully detects Hello flood attack, jamming attack and selective forwarding attack by analyzing the network statistics and malicious node behavior. The simulation results show that network performs better when neighbor node trust management based anomaly detection technique is in place.
Awake tracheal intubation is commonly performed with flexible bronchoscopes, but the emerging role of alternative airway devices, such as videolaryngoscopes, direct laryngoscopes, and optical stylets, has been recognised.          CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched for RCTs that compared flexible bronchoscopes, direct laryngoscopes, optical stylets and channelled or unchannelled videolaryngoscopes in adult patients having awake tracheal intubation were included. The co-primary outcomes were first-pass success rate and time to tracheal intubation. Continuous outcomes were extracted as mean and standard deviation, and dichotomous outcomes were converted to overall numbers of incidence. Frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted, and network plots and network league tables were produced.           Twelve RCTs were included, none of which evaluated direct laryngoscopes. The first-pass success rate was not different between flexible bronchoscopes, optical stylets, and channelled and unchannelled videolaryngoscopes, with the quality of evidence rated as moderate in view of imprecision. Optical stylets, followed by unchannelled videolaryngoscopes and then felxible bronchoscopes resulted in the shortest time to tracheal intubation, with the quality of evidence rated as high. No differences were shown between the airway devices with respect to the incidence of oesophageal intubation, change of airway technique, oxygen desaturation, airway bleeding, or the rate of hoarseness and sore throat.           Flexible bronchoscopes, optical stylets, and channelled and unchannelled videolaryngoscopes were clinically comparable airway devices in the setting of awake trachela intubation and the time to tracheal intubation was shortest with optical stylets and longest with flexible bronchoscopes.
Routing is a key design factor to obtain the maximum performance out of interconnection networks. Depending on the number of routing options that packets may use, routing algorithms are classified into two categories. If the packet can only use a single predetermined path, routing is deterministic, whereas if several paths are available, it is adaptive. It is well-known that adaptive routing usually outperforms deterministic routing. However, adaptive routers are more complex and introduces out-of-order delivery of packets. In this paper, we take up the challenge of developing a deterministic routing algorithm for direct topologies that can obtain a similar performance than adaptive routing, while providing the inherent advantages of deterministic routing such as in-order delivery of packets and implementation simplicity. The proposed deterministic routing algorithm is aware of the HoL-blocking effect, and it is designed to reduce it, which, as known, it is a key contributor to degrade interconnection network performance.
Edge computing emerges as a new paradigm to provide low-latency network services in close proximity to end users. Based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology, network services can be flexibly and scalably provisioned as virtual network function (VNF) chains deployed at edge servers. With such advantages, both the industry and research communities have done extensive studies on deploying VNF chains at network edge. The existing works mainly take an ideal assumption that the network is totally safe and there are no malicious users. Therefore, they leverage all available resources to serve their users. However, such an assumption is impractical in real networks. Security services, such as firewall, deep packet detection, intrusion detection, are always required for production networks. The existing service deployment methods fail to consider the co-existence of security services and functionality services. In this paper, we present the topic of joint deployment of both security and functionality services, wherein the security services are responsible to check the data flows before being processed by the functionality services. To solve this problem, we propose the Secure Deployment Pattern, which aims to simultaneously satisfy the security protection and QoS requirements at network edge. It divides the services into two kinds, i.e., the user-oriented functionality services, and the service provider-oriented security services. In this case, it is very challenging to jointly deploy the security services and functional services with respect to the resource and latency constraints. We formulate this problem as an integer programming model, and propose the heuristic algorithms to solve it. As far as we know, this paper is the first step, which targets at a proper orchestration of security and functionality services in edge computing. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient, in terms of the execution time and the average number of served requests.
The swift advancement and updating of urban lighting systems, along with the incorporation of smart and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, have opened up numerous opportunities for technological progress across various facets of life. This paper offers a comprehensive overview on the development of smart public street lighting infrastructure tailored for IoT applications in smart cities. Initially, the focus lies on transitioning from conventional lighting to Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) technology in street lighting. Complementing this transition, the incorporation of the wireless networked sensors and controllers ensures dynamic brightness control in operational zones, envisioning substantial energy savings. Furthermore, the notion characterizing smart cities denotes incorporating modern digital infrastructures to develop innovative functionalities and connect various application, following the IoT paradigm. The key findings from the proposed study have enhanced knowledge regarding smart public street lighting application. This system integrates smart poles equipped with LEDs lamps technology, smart sensors, communication network and monitoring unit, leveraging current technological advancements in IoT applications. The implementation of IoT-based smart public street lighting systems presents several challenges, including integrating diverse sensors and actuators ensuring robust device communication, secure data management, and effective system scaling and maintenance. Despite these challenges, this system significantly advances smart city infrastructure by enhancing energy efficiency, safety, and sustainability. However, addressing their high initial costs, data privacy and security concerns, and ongoing maintenance are crucial in future studies to realize their full potential in smart cities.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the international standardization organism for the Internet, has recently approved a standard, RFC 9061, which defines an interface and framework with which to manage IPsec SAs autonomously by using the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. In this framework, a centralized entity, the controller, sends configuration information to IPsec-enabled nodes in the network in order to create IPsec SAs. Two cases are presented:     , in which the nodes ship an IKE implementation that is configured by the controller or     , in which the controller sends the IPsec SAs directly to the nodes, among other relevant security information.    This paper analyzes both cases in depth, provides a design for the controller’s operation based on Mealy state machines and obtains experimental results from a virtualized testbed so as to compare these cases, which are missing parts in the standard.                       Analysis of a standard SDN framework for IPsec management.        Formalization of controller’s behavior (through state machines).        Proof-of-concept implementation.        Performance evaluation based on experimental results.
Handling efficiently both wired and/or wireless devices in SDN networks is still an open issue. eHDDP comes as an enhanced version of the Hybrid Domain Discovery Protocol (HDDP) that allows the SDN control plane to discover and manage hybrid topologies composed by both SDN and non-SDN devices with wired and/or wireless interfaces, thus opening a path for the integration of IoT and SDN networks. Moreover, the proposal is also able to detect both unidirectional and bidirectional links between wireless devices. eHDDP has been thoroughly evaluated in different scenarios and exhibits good scalability properties since the number of required messages is proportional to the number of existing links in the network topology. Moreover, the obtained discovery and processing times give the opportunity to support scenarios with low mobility devices since the discovery times are in the range of hundreds of milliseconds.
As a primary means of communication, the role of mobile telecommunications networks is important for a developing country's economic and social development. However, especially rural areas in low-income countries still lack mobile coverage. In the academic literature, only segmented solution strategies for this mobile coverage problem in rural areas are proposed. These are either technological, regulatory, or organizational solutions, whereas solving the mobile coverage gap requires an integrated approach to develop arrangements for mobile network rollout in rural areas. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the causes of the lack of mobile coverage, the available solutions, and how they can be combined. Based on this overview, the paper proposes a decision support scheme for selecting a suitable arrangement for solving the mobile coverage gap. In this decision support scheme, the technical, organizational, and regulatory solutions are combined to develop a set of arrangements that match the local key causes of the lack of mobile coverage and that fit with the local context. In the last phase of the decision support scheme, the relevant stakeholders are involved in selecting the most suitable arrangement. We demonstrate the decision support scheme by applying it to the case of an unserved rural village in Indonesia, Unipa on the island of Papua, to show how it can guide a developing country to initiate the process of developing a solution for mobile coverage problems in rural areas.                        Mobile telecommunication services play a crucial role in developing countries.        Only partial solutions to solve this gap are addressed in the literature.        We developed an integral decision support scheme for policy makers to go beyond the usual solutions.        Stakeholders need to be involved to prioritize solution arrangements.        We demonstrate the scheme with a case study in Indonesia to show its potential.
Tactile sensors can transform the environmental stimuli into electrical signals to perceive and quantify the environmental information, which show huge application prospects. The development of bionic robots and wearable devices towards intelligence has put high demands on the performance of tactile sensor arrays. Herein, the current state-of-the-art tactile sensor arrays over recent years have been summarized, from sensor array fabrication to advanced applications. The main preparation methods of patterned array including screen printing, 3D printing, laser microprocessing, and textile technology are discussed in detail. Strategies to optimize the signal crosstalk caused by flexible high-density sensor arrays are systematically introduced from the perspective of structure design and circuit design. Furthermore, advanced tactile sensors are not limited to a single pressure sensing function, and hence the development of multimodal detection for sensors has been discussed. In order to promote the adaptability in applications, stretchable and self-powered versatile integration scheme for advanced sensing are briefly described. Then, by means of machine learning and neural networks, it is possible to deeply explore the information embedded in the tactile acquisition signal with enriched application scenarios. Finally, the current challenges and the future perspectives for flexible tactile sensor arrays towards practical use are provided.
This paper presents a mathematical optimization framework for the strategic placement of quasi-dynamic wireless charging (QWC) stations within road networks to address the charging needs of battery electric buses (BEBs). This study evaluates two scenarios for powering the buses. In the first scenario, a grid-connected system is considered. The optimization aims to minimize annual costs related to capital, operation, and energy losses of the electric bus fleet. This involves determining the optimal locations for QWC stations, the length of power transmitters, and the corresponding battery capacities for the BEBs. Using MATLAB-based optimization tools Casadi and Yalmip, with solvers Bonmin and Fmincon, the optimal configuration includes a 13 kWh battery capacity and a 300 m power transmitter distributed across five bus stop areas. The second scenario employs a chance-constrained optimization approach for an isolated solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS). This system is designed to reliably meet the BEBs' energy requirements throughout the day, considering different seasonal data (winter, summer, all seasons/year-round). The optimization results for the PV and BESS capacities vary with the seasons: 394.247 kW and 2012.6 kWh using summer data, 1762.1 kW and 2738.2 kWh using winter data, and 1610.8 kW and 2741.9 kWh using year-round data. Additionally, the paper examines the impact of varying bus fleet sizes on the optimal battery size and power transmitter combination using a real-world example of the bus route between Khalifa City and Abu Dhabi Downtown in the UAE. The findings suggest that larger batteries with fewer or no charging stations are more economical for smaller fleets. Conversely, as the fleet size increases, a combination of smaller battery sizes and a greater number (and length) of QWC (power transmitters) becomes more cost-effective. This research offers significant insights into the efficient deployment of QWC stations and the integration of renewable energy and energy storage for sustainable urban electric bus networks. The proposed optimization models provide a systematic approach to designing and operating charging infrastructure, contributing to sustainable urban transportation systems. Moreover, the study highlights the influence of seasonal data on PV system sizing and costs.
Smart grids security can be achieved by a comprehensive study of sources of threats.        A model for this identification and classification is presented.        A framework for the threats clearance based on the source of threats is discussed.              Smart grids (SGs) deployments have made power systems operation more efficient by the application of distributed computing schemes in grids’ interoperation. However, these schemes have triggered various security issues which are growing to be of major concerns. Physical attacks, cyber-attacks or natural disasters are major notable form of threats to SGs deployment which could lead to infrastructural failure, blackouts, energy theft, customer privacy breach, endangered safety of operating personnel, etc. Hence, the need to critically examine the security issues aimed at preventing possible threats or failures. In this review, various security challenges and threats are discussed with respect to their possible sources of occurrence. These threats are then classified and a framework for achieving more secured SGs is suggested.
Reprogramming is an important issue in wireless sensor networks. It enables users to extend or correct functionality of a sensor network after deployment at a low cost. In this paper, we investigate the problem of improving energy efficiency and delay of reprogramming by using data compression and incremental updates. We analyze different algorithms for both approaches, as well as their combination, when applied to resource-constrained devices. Our results show that the classic Lempel-Ziv-77 compression algorithm with Bsdiff for delta encoding has the best overall performance compared to other compression algorithms; on average reducing energy usage by 74% and enabling 71% faster updates.
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) query algorithm based on road network plays an important role in location based service, which had been widely used in intelligent transportation, roadside assistance and other fields. However, as road network density increases and the number of points of interest increases, query efficiency decreases sharply.In order to improve the query efficiency, we adopted the MapReduce parallel computing framework to complete the query of K neighbor moving objects by designing Map, Reduce, Combiner and other functions. Before the start of the query, the road network was divided into pieces, and each fragment was calculated. The final K-nearest neighbor moving objects were obtained by aggregating the calculated results of each slice to realize the parallel optimization of KNN algorithm based on road network. The experimental results showed that the performance of parallel KNN algorithm based on MapReduce was better than that of serial KNN query algorithm in large-scale road network environment and the larger K value of query request.
We discuss how resilient satellite constellation networks are against attacks. Two types of robustness are focused in this paper. One is the topology-related network robustness, which mainly assesses the effect of attacks or faults on satellites and links. The other is the network function robustness related to routing mechanisms, which mainly assesses how resource allocation mechanisms affect network robustness. To this purpose, two satellite constellation network models based on physical network topology and traffic are proposed, along with a new satellite importance index and the robustness metrics. Based on the newly proposed satellite importance index, three different types of attacking strategies are implemented in this paper, i.e., random attacks, selective attacks based on the initial state of the network, and selective attacks based on the current state of the network. The routing methods involved in function robustness mainly include different local state routing algorithms, which we summarize into a brand-new routing model with tunable parameters. Simulation results show that the removals by the selective attacks based on the current state of the network are often more harmful than the other attack strategies. Constellation networks almost collapse for the above attack strategies as the attack ratio are nearly 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 respectively. Meanwhile, the larger constellation is more robust than the smaller one against the attacks before collapses. However, the larger constellation collapses earlier for the selective attack strategies. In addition, local-state routing algorithms with a certain level of state awareness capability can be used to improve the network function robustness.
In the oil pipeline world, wireless automation plays an important role through integrated electronic technology in antenna design for robust performance. The technology gets evaluated by its power consumption and compactness to afford a better solution to real-world problems with better sophistication to adopt a modernized wireless world. Among that, the IoT (Internet of Things) technology plays a predominant role by combining with Artificial Intelligence to optimize and revolute the characterization of data communication. When the data communication is initiated, the main contributor to the transmission is the miniaturized antenna holding different types in its structure and processing. It acquires the required radio spectrum channel with the advanced multi coding modulating technique by utilizing token ring mesh topology for the data transfer with acquired data channels. This chapter describes the design and fabrication of a miniaturized antenna using MEMS technology (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) and its different types using INTELLISUITE software to get suited for better communication in oil pipelines. Based on the application, it also enumerates the choices of micro or nanoantennas with its specification upholding data adopting techniques with modulation schemes to support IoT applications.
The FiWi network is a combination of optical backend and wireless front end. One of the key issues in FiWi network is ONU placement since it is related to network deployment cost. The present work proposes a cost efficient algorithm for ONU placement. Initially we place ONUs in center region of each grid. Then we minimize the number of ONUs by ensuring that all the wireless routers are connected to at least one ONU. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm offers better solution for optimal placement of ONUs. Hence, by using proposed algorithm we can make cost-efficient FiWi network.
ROADM Implementation for Efficient Capacity Expansion.        Order-Based Connection Management Algorithm.        Increased Optical Network Efficiency.        Scalable and Economically Efficient Design for Elastic optical networks.               Network operators diversify service offerings and enhance network efficiency by leveraging bandwidth-variable transceivers and colorless flexible-grid reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs). Nonetheless, the paradigm shift from rigid to elastic optical networks (EONs) has affected several key parameters, including bit rate, center frequency spacing, modulation format, and optical reach. This study investigated the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the design and structure of optical network architectures, including spectrally efficient multicarrier systems and bandwidth-variable wavelength-selective switches. A cost-effective ROADM architecture applying an order-based connecting approach was introduced, which presented a high connectivity level and a blockage probability of less than 10     . When this architecture was implemented in the EON, the data transportation rate was 1 Tb/s. This outcome successfully accommodated a 20 % surge in traffic demand, while the optimized network architecture significantly improved fiber utilization by 3.4 %. Consequently, this study contributed a practical and efficient solution for implementing flexible optical networks, effectively addressing current concerns and propelling the optical communication system sector forward.
Optical transmission systems provide high capacity, low latency and jitter, and high reliability for city-scale networks. Recirculating loop experiments have facilitated the study of signal propagation in long-haul optical transmission systems. However, they are unsuited for developing control and management software for city-scale optical networks with dozens or hundreds of reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer (ROADM) units, diverse interconnection topologies, and dynamic traffic patterns. Large-scale testbeds can help, but may be inflexible and time- or cost-prohibitive. Reconfigurable testbeds such as COSMOS enable piece-wise emulation of a city-scale network by applying space and wavelength switching, dual-use software-defined networking (SDN) controllers, and comb sources, while digital twin models enable software emulation. Results from the development of a digital twin for COSMOS are presented for optical amplifiers and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) including both analytical and machine learning (ML) models.
The reconstruction of the communication network is a precondition for the smooth implementation of rescue and disaster recovery after geological disasters. Although traditional post-disaster emergency communication equipment, such as emergency communication vehicles, satellite access stations and satellite communication terminals, to a certain extent, can solve communication problems, the firmware of them makes such equipment faced with difficulty in adapting to the complex disaster environment, limited network coverage and poor mobility of such devices. To settle those problems, we have proposed an integrated satellite-ground emergency constructed-network after disaster technology. The nodes of the network specifically including Mesh AP (access point) nodes and satellite portable stations, adopt a portable design which can be easily carried by the Network deployer and deployed to the corresponding location. The actual deployment test results of the multi-site network show that our technical solution can build a stable emergency communication network within 30 ​min and support multi-user access, on which users can carry out audio and video communication, file transmission and other services.
This paper aimed to monitor the different bus parameters in a substation from a centralized control room with the help of Zigbee enabled wireless sensor network (WSN). The parameters such as magnitude and phase angles of voltage and current, frequency, rate-of-change-of-frequency (ROCOF), active and reactive powers are measured using a state-of-the-art customized Zigbee enabled phasor measurement unit (ZPMU). The data from different ZPMUs at different bus nodes are acquired with the help of WSN system in order to have a centralized monitoring of different equipments load status. The coordination among different parameters for different buses and/or equipment is done from a centralized control room within the substation or plant with the help of substation management software and Zigbee networking. The data thus collected are utilized to study the power flow status of the different buses on real time basis and are stored within a server based database for future analysis purposes.
Identification of an appropriate route choice model to understand travel behavior remains challenging. To this end, Fosgerau et al. (2013) have recently developed a link-based route choice model termed the “recursive logit” (RL) model. A decision-maker is assumed to choose the next link recursively that maximizes the sum of instantaneous utility and expected downstream utility at each node. However, in practical application, some computational issues remain, including large (and often ill-defined) matrix inversions. Here, we develop an alternative RL model that considers the probability of awareness of the next link that improves the stability of model estimations. The model was estimated using vehicle trajectory data from the ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) 2.0 dataset of the Tokyo Metropolitan area, and the results were compared to those of a conventional RL model in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.
Relay selection of physical layer network coding (PNC) for two-way relay model is investigated in this paper. Two end nodes transmit their signals to multiple relays simultaneously, and the single relay which performs the best symbol error rate (SER) performance is selected to process the received superimposed signal and broadcast the network-coded packet to the end nodes. The SER performance of the proposed relay selection scheme is analyzed and full diversity order is derived if all the relays are used. Extensive simulations are performed and the results show that minimized SER relay selection can considerably enhance the performance of PNC two-way relay channels.
Nowadays, Information centric networking has tremendous importance in accessing internet based applications. The increasing rate of Internet traffic has encouraged to adapt content centric architectures to better serve content provider needs and user demand of internet based applications. These architectures have built-in network Caches and these properties improves efficiency of content delivery with high speed and great efficiency. By using Information centric architectures, users need not download content from content server despite they can easily access data from nearby caches. User requested content is independent of the location of the data by use of caching approaches and does not rely on storage and transmission methodologies of that content. There has been many researches going on which is based on caching approaches in the Content centric network. Efficient caching is essential to reduce delay and to enhance performance of the network. Along with caching, a good cache replacement scheme is also necessary to decide which content item should reside in the cache and which content should be evicted. So, in this paper, we presented a Cache content replacement (CCR) scheme for information centric network with evaluation of popularity of the content. Performance of CCR scheme will be evaluated in provision of cache hit ratio and Cache load.
As positioning sensors, edge computation power, and communication technologies continue to develop, a moving agent can now sense its surroundings and communicate with other agents. By receiving spatial information from both its environment and other agents, an agent can use various methods and sensor types to localize itself. With its high flexibility and robustness, collaborative positioning has become a widely used method in both military and civilian applications. This paper introduces the basic fundamental concepts and applications of collaborative positioning, and reviews recent progress in the field based on camera, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), wireless sensor, and their integration. The paper compares the current methods with respect to their sensor type, summarizes their main paradigms, and analyzes their evaluation experiments. Finally, the paper discusses the main challenges and open issues that require further research.
The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of a communication network utilizing Long Range (LoRa) low-power wide-area network protocol for the telemetry of detected target chemicals. The sensor platform under development allows traditional electrochemical techniques to be executed with a low Size, Weight, and Power (low SWaP) system that is deployable using an autonomous or remote-controlled vehicle. Once in the field, the sensors communicate target chemical concentrations to a centralized gateway through LoRa to an Internet of Things (IoT) network. Researchers are currently deploying the prototype network for field testing of each node’s sensing, meshing, and communication capabilities throughout all weather climates. Developing a robust and dynamic sensor network to monitor the environment and provide a live data feed to detect chemicals of interest in the environment eliminates the need for direct human interaction. The low power consumption of LoRa allows the network nodes to be deployed for an extended amount of time on a single battery supply.
This paper addresses new challenges arising from the emergence of Bluetooth mesh and its rapid adoption in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT.    One of the main problems associated with Bluetooth mesh is the power consumption of the mesh nodes, since the network needs to be scanned constantly to receive and relay messages. In order to reduce the energy consumption in the nodes where possible, the friendship mechanism is provided as a solution by the Bluetooth mesh specification.    The friendship mechanism enables Low Power Nodes (LPNs) to spend most of their lifetime in sleep mode without losing the messages addressed to them. For this purpose, a node that is constantly in scan mode, called friend node (FN), stores these messages, sending them on request. This mechanism works with a stop-and-wait protocol, resulting in inefficient channel utilisation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no proposals for the improvement of this mechanism, likely due to its novelty.    This paper studies different approaches for the improvement of the friendship mechanism: improving the Bearer Layer, improving time synchronisation and improving advertising channel utilisation. The results of this study reveal that each of the proposals presents a limitation that makes its final implementation unfeasible, and thus the challenge arises of developing a proposal for its optimisation. Accordingly, this work presents a proposal to improve the friendship mechanism with Burst Transmissions and Listen Before Transmit (BTLBT), which has been evaluated and validated in real hardware platforms. The results obtained for 4 LPNs show a reduction in the time required to receive the FN messages, as well as a 66.65% reduction in the time required to scan for each message. Finally, a consumption study is presented, where the results show that our proposal achieves a 19.81% improvement in lifetime compared to the standard friendship mechanism.       Graphical abstract                                      Bluetooth mesh provides the friendship mechanism for battery operated devices.        Different approaches for the improvement of the friendship mechanism are studied.        Our final proposals improve the Bluetooth mesh friendship mechanism.        Experiments reveal a reduction in the scanning time required per message of up to 66.65%.        Our proposal also achieves a 19.81% increase in Low Power Node lifetime.
A Frobenius group is a transitive but not regular permutation group such that only the identity element can fix two points. A finite Frobenius group can be expressed as                            a nilpotent normal subgroup. A first-kind          -Frobenius graph is a Cayley graph on           with connection set                   -orbit on                   , where           is of even order or           consists of involutions. We classify all 6-valent first-kind Frobenius circulant graphs such that the underlying kernel           is cyclic. We give optimal gossiping and routing algorithms for such a circulant and compute its forwarding indices, Wiener indices and minimum gossip time. We also prove that its broadcasting time is equal to its diameter plus two or three. We prove that all 6-valent first-kind Frobenius circulants with cyclic kernels are Eisenstein–Jacobi graphs, the latter being Cayley graphs on quotient rings of the ring of Eisenstein–Jacobi integers. We also prove that larger Eisenstein–Jacobi graphs can be constructed from smaller ones as topological covers, and a similar result holds for 6-valent first-kind Frobenius circulants. As a corollary any Eisenstein–Jacobi graph with order congruent to 1 modulo 6 and underlying Eisenstein–Jacobi integer not an associate of a real integer, is a cover of a 6-valent first-kind Frobenius circulant. A distributed real-time computing architecture known as HARTS or hexagonal mesh is a special 6-valent first-kind Frobenius circulant.
In this paper, an acoustic monitoring system is developed to address the issue and limitations of large volume sampling. IRIS and MICAz sensor motes are used to realize the hardware requirements of the WSN and the acquired data were processed. Multi-hop capability of the mesh network is also implemented. A couple of limitations are encountered on the motes such as the limited sampling rate achievable on the mote and the size of the data to be acquired. In order to find out the various limitations of the mote, numerous tests are conducted and stable parameters are used in the final system. A comparison was made between the reconstructed audio and the original audio to highlight the key differences. A low level detection system is proposed. Problems encountered during the course of work are also highlighted and solutions are proposed. With all the required objectives met, the paper has contributed to the development of an acoustic monitoring system.
Graphical abstract                                       A conformal, soft, breathable, biocompatible, wireless epidermal surface electromyography sensor system was developed utilizing a “laser cut and paste” fabrication method and optimized serpentine structure.        The excellent surface electromyography signal collected by the proposed system contributes to the high accuracy of hand gesture recognition (∼81.02 %).        The low-cost yet high-performance proposed system demonstrated its conceptual feasibility in quantitatively evaluation of stroke patient’s hand and facilitating human-robot collaboration in hand rehabilitation by proof-of-the-concept clinical testing.              Surface electromyography (sEMG) plays a significant role in the everyday practice of clinic hand function rehabilitation. The materials and design of current typical clinic sEMG electrodes are rigid Ag/AgCl or flexible polyimide (PI) film, which cannot provide a stable interface between electrodes and skin for adequate long-term high-quality data. Thus, conformal, soft, breathable, wireless epidermal sEMG sensor systems have broad potential relevance to clinic rehabilitation settings. Herein, we demonstrate a stretchable epidermal sEMG sensor array system with optimized materials and structure strategies for hand gesture recognition and hand function rehabilitation. The optimized serpentine structures with marvelous stretchability and improved fill ratio, provide lower impedance and high-quality sEMG signals. Moreover, the easy-to-use airhole method further ensures stable and long-term contact with the skin for recording. In addition, integrated with a customized flexible wireless data acquisition system, the capability for real-time 8-channel sEMG monitoring is developed, and taking together with the CNN-based algorithm, the system can automatically and reliably realize the 7 kinds of hand gestures with an accuracy of 81.02%. Moreover, the low-cost yet high-performance epidermal sEMG sensor system demonstrated its conceptual feasibility in quantitatively evaluation of stroke patient’s hand and facilitating human-robot collaboration in hand rehabilitation by proof-of-the-concept clinical testing.
This paper introduces an SLA-based routing mechanism to lower the Co      emission rate of the optical networks governed by GMPLS. This approach provides the most available routes between any pair of source and destination nodes using a routing table populated in advance, using the combination of weather forecasting information and energy resource maps supplied to the control plane of GMPLS optical networks.
In this paper, the Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) has been developed for location tracking purposes. The two possible techniques of localization, namely the RSSI based and the hop count based, were investigated. For RSSI based technique, the principle and methodology was presented. The experiment was carried out to investigate the performance between the RSS and hop count technique. A set of nesC programme was designed to review the structural requirement. The performance analyses of both techniques in localization were investigated.
In this paper, we formulate an Energy Efficient (EE) deployment for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) that consists of multiple clusters of sensor nodes, one mobile sink in each of them, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for the whole MWSN. The UAV receives the collected sensed data from the mobile sinks wirelessly in order to deliver them to various IoT-based users’ devices. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve optimization in terms of energy consumption minimization and network lifetime enhancement.
WiGig technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ad and later IEEE 802.11ay, provide multi-gigabit short-range communication at 60 GHz for bandwidth-intensive applications. However, this band suffers from high propagation losses that can only be compensated using highly directional antennas, making millimeter-wave (mmWave) links susceptible to blockage and errors. This high sensitivity to blockage leads to unstable and unreliable connections, since proprietary IEEE 802.11ad mechanisms, such as beamforming training, have high overhead, and can only be triggered when performance degradation is already detected, which compromises QoS and QoE even more.     This article proposes a proactive machine learning framework that uses real-life data acquired in an outdoor setting to improve the reliability and resilience of a blockage-prone WiGig-based network. In particular, we propose a link quality classifier, which can differentiate between normal, long-term blockage and short-term operation with a test             -score of 97%. Moreover, we introduce a novel deep learning forecasting model that can accurately capture the interactions between past multi-layer observations under different environments to produce accurate forecasts for 16 KPIs.
Printed electronics, fueled by graphene's conductivity and flexibility, are revolutionizing wearable technology, surpassing copper's limitations in cost, signal quality, size, and environmental impact. Graphene-based inks are positioned to lead in this domain, offering cost-effective solutions directly applicable to materials such as textiles and paper. However, graphene encounters a primary drawback due to its lack of an energy band gap, constraining its potential applications in various electronic devices. In this study, we present a novel formulation of a superconductive, flexible leather graphene antenna utilizing a tri-nanocomposite structure of Graphene Nanoplatelet/Silver/Copper (GNP/Ag/Cu), covering a wideband bandwidth from 5.2 GHz to 8.5 GHz. The electrical conductivity of the GNP/Ag/Cu sample was assessed using the four-point probe method. With each additional layer, conductivity increased from 10.473 × 10      S/m to 40.218 × 10      S/m, demonstrating a direct correlation between conductivity and antenna gain. The study evaluates the efficacy of various thicknesses of conductive Graphene (GNP/Ag/Cu) ink on drill fabric. Safety assurance is provided through specific absorption rate (SAR) testing, indicating 0.84 W/kg per 10 g of tissue for an input power of 0.5 W, in compliance with ICNIRP standards for wearable device safety. Additionally, a morphological analysis of the antenna was conducted, showcasing its potential for efficient signal transmission in wearable electronic devices.

Over the last decades, the emerging paradigms, e.g., centralized mobile cloud computing (MCC), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and collaborative computing offloading (CCO), have attracted extensive attention in adaptive 5G low latency communication for Tactile Internet. Besides, a novel integrated wireless optical transport network emerges in access networks and supports joint fronthaul and backhaul services. Therefore, considering that the task offloading response time, the needs of proximity, and the ultra-dense 5G small cell deployment, a novelty hybrid cloudlet deployment scheme over fiber and wireless backhaul-aware infrastructure is created with efficient cost optimization in mind. In this work, the envisioned Fiber Wireless networks (FiWi) consists of optical backhaul and wireless fronthaul (i.e., integrated access network and backhaul link), whereby base stations (BSs) with fiber and wireless backhauls are referred as wired-BS (WBS) and unwired-BS (UBS), respectively. Therefore, to meet the quality of service (QoS) delay constraints, cloudlets can be deployed in either UBSs, WBS, or remote node (RN). However, we apply mixed-integer line programming (MILP) to resolve the convex optimization problem in terms of minimization deployment cost. Besides, we describe the QoS-aware hybrid cloudlet placement cost algorithm for WBS and UBS coverage areas against different network conditions. It was shown through experimental measurements that the proposed architecture can achieve the scalability in different deployment scenarios. Also, the dependency of minimization cloudlet deployment cost on variable network parameters in terms of user density, network framework, and network QoS can be validated.                        Given the IBFD self-backhauling, we develop a hybrid cloudlet deployment paradigm over the FiWi backhaul-aware network infrastructure to provide all the UEs with enough total task service rate, and further reduce the hybrid cloudlet deployment cost and achieve the optimal numbers of VMs in different location-based cloudlet.        We formulate an optimization hybrid cloudlet deployment cost problem with objective function and several constraint conditions. To discard some constraints, we reconstruct Lagrange functions and KKT condition to achieve the variables’ optimal solution. Therefore, we propose QoS-aware hybrid cloudlet placement solution for WBS and UBS coverage area aiming at achieving the optimal solution.        We demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed QoS-aware hybrid cloudlet placement algorithm to the meta-Heuristic algorithm under different cell planning scenarios. Besides, we perform the parameter analytical by the effect of population density and QoS delay constrain on hybrid cloudlet deployment cost.
The industries are presently exploring the use of wired and wireless systems for control, automation, and monitoring. The primary benefit of wireless technology is that it reduces the installation cost, in both money and labor terms, as companies already have a significant investment in wiring. The research article presents the work on the analysis of Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) in a wireless real-time communication medium for a Networked Control System (NCS), and determining whether the simulated behavior is significant for a plant or not. The behavior of the MANET is analyzed for Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) that maintenances communication among 150 nodes for NCS. The simulation is carried out in Network Simulator (NS2) software with different nodes cluster to estimate the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and control overhead. The benefit of MANET is that it has a fixed topology, which permits flexibility since mobile devices may be used to construct ad-hoc networks anywhere, scalability because more nodes can be added to the network, and minimal operating expenses in that no original infrastructure needs to be developed. AODV routing is a flat routing system that does not require central routing nodes. As the network grows in size, the network can be scaled to meet the network design and configuration requirements. AODV is flexible to support different configurations and topological nodes in dynamic networks because of its versatility. The advantage of such network simulation and routing behavior provides the future direction for the researchers who are working towards the embedded hardware solutions for NCS, as the hardware complexity depends on the delay, throughput, and PDR.

The Internet of Things is poised to become an important crossroads for several technologies. As a result, it will be possible to connect smart physical goods and enable smart decision-making across a wide range of applications. Various devices, including computers, actuators, and sensors, may link to one another and exchange data in a networked environment known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart refers to how humans communicate with technology, whereas ”smart objects” describes the machines themselves. As the market's supply of gadgets grows, ensuring their safety becomes more critical than ever. The availability of cutting-edge methods and tools has been instrumental in the current surge of interest in IoT security studies. To guarantee success, these applications need the characteristics of the environment provided by the IoT framework. This essay dives deep into the IoT's layered architecture, layer-by-layer protocols, cutting-edge use cases, and pervasive security concerns. In addition to analysing the current security structure, this paper provides a research taxonomy for IoT. Our study is more comprehensive than many that have come before it on the topic of the Internet of Things; we look at everything from sensors to real-world applications.
Federated Learning (FL) enhances Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications by enabling individual devices to collaboratively learn shared models without uploading local data with third parties, thereby preserving privacy. However, implementing FL in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges, especially with IoT devices with limited memory, diverse communication conditions, and varying computational capabilities. The research community is turning to lightweight FL, the new solutions that optimize FL training, inference, and deployment to work efficiently on IoT devices. This paper reviews lightweight FL, systematically organizing and summarizing the related techniques based on its workflow. Finally, we indicate potential problems in this area and suggest future directions to provide valuable insights into the field.                       Conduct a comprehensive review of related research on lightweight FL.        Explore the training, reasoning, and deployment processes of lightweight FL.        Identify the challenges and future directions of lightweight FL in real world.
Flight operations over the North Pacific Ocean are affected by strong westerly jet streams, which have day-to-day weather variations as well as seasonal trends. Fast-time simulation is used to evaluate the effect of proposed airspace and procedure changes on flight operations, and the results must reflect seasonal trends while not being overly influenced by conditions on any given day. Aggregating the results of air traffic flow simulations using the winds on a large number of days spread over a year will achieve this but requires considerable time and effort, and a method to obtain a reasonable evaluation using a small set of representative wind conditions and a minimum number of simulations is desired. This paper proposes using clustering to achieve this. To avoid having to cluster large meteorological data sets and to reduce the dimensionality of the data, we used Pacific Organised Track System (PACOTS) tracks as a surrogate for wind conditions since these are calculated considering the daily winds aloft. For a schedule of ten major trans-Pacific flight services, we compared statistical trends over a full year of routes and those on wind days chosen by five candidate methods, which consisted of clustering and non-clustering methods. The constant-interval selection of days from a dendrogram produced via Ward's clustering captured the seasonal variation of winds over the studied year with the highest fidelity. Airspaces in which winds aloft dominate flight planning and for which daily wind-optimal tracks are published exist in other oceanic areas, and the proposed method is also applicable to their simulation studies.                        Reflection of winds aloft in air traffic flow simulations over the Pacific Ocean.        Simulation of oceanic airspace including seasonal variations using a small number of days.        Classification of winds aloft by clustering using wind-optimum flight routes.        Statistical method to evaluate the best method of selecting wind reflection day.
The paper deals with      routing in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. A sequence of requests arrives over time, each is a pair of nodes to be connected by a path. The problem is to assign a      and a      to each pair, so that no two paths sharing a link are assigned the same wavelength. The goal is to minimize the number of wavelengths used to establish all connections. Raghavan and Upfal (Proc. 26th Annual Symp. on Theory of Computing, 1994, pp. 133–143) considered the off-line version of the problem, which was further studied in Aumann and Rabani (Proc. 6th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, 1995, pp. 567–576), Kaklamanis and Persiano (Proc. 4th Annual European Symp. on Algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1136, Springer, Berlin, 1996, pp. 460–470), Mihail et al. (Proc. 36th IEEE Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1995, pp. 548–557), Rabani, (Proc. 37th Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1996, pp. 400–409). For a line topology, the problem is the well-studied interval graph coloring problem. Ondashline algorithms for this problem have been analyzed in Kierstead and Trotter (Congr. Numer. 33 (1981) 143–153). We consider trees, trees of rings, and meshes topologies, previously studied in the off-line case. We give ondashline algorithms with competitive ratio O(log     ) for all these topologies. We give a matching Ω(log     ) lower bound for meshes. We also prove that any algorithm for trees cannot have competitive ratio better than Ω(log     /log log     ). We also consider the problem where every edge is associated with parallel links. While in WDM technology, a fiber link requires different wavelengths for every transmission, space division multiplexing technology allows parallel links for a single wavelength, at an additional cost. Thus, it may be beneficial in terms of network economics to combine between the two technologies (this is indeed done in practice). For      networks with Ω(log     ) parallel links we give an ondashline algorithm with competitive ratio O(log
Developing applications for IoT and Cloud is di    cult for a number of reasons; even without considering the inherent complexity of distributed computing, there are several competing platforms, programming languages and communication protocols. It can be argued that this is holding back the industry as a whole: Applications are di    cult to write, deploy and manage. In this position paper we present     , a hybrid framework combining ideas from the Actor model and Flow Based Computing. We show that by dividing applications into four well-defined aspects –   describe, connect, deploy  , and      – we get an intuitive method for application development, and a flexible, distributed platform for deploying and managing applications. Additionally, we keep Calvin language and platform agnostic by only prescribing a lightweight runtime API, with a limited number of specified communication protocols – with no requirements on the carrier – for communicating with runtimes, between runtimes, and passing data between components.
Internet applications nowadays combine globally shared resources into a single software platform. It's a difficult technology issue to supply reports for the resource consumption among those World Wide Web applications. The formulation and simulation of spread levels were introduced in this report. Spread frequency operates together again to impose a worldwide speed restriction over revenue aggregated at several locations allowing for the synchronized monitoring of an internet company's activity. Assures that traffic delays mass transit streams act as passing through a unique, common limitation network. We describe two models overall and the other TCP-optimized—that permits network operators to expressly balance away transmission cost with network correctness, speed, and scaling. All these approaches could speed restrict 1000s of streams with little expense (less than 3% in the tested configuration). We show that with us TCP-centric architecture could scale to hundreds of servers whilst remaining resilient towards both outages and transmission postponement, suitable for countrywide telecom operators.
Mobile social networking is a new trend for social networking that enables users with similar interests to connect together through mobile devices. Therefore, it possesses the same features of a social network with added support to the features of a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) in terms of limited computing power, limited coverage, and intermittent connectivity. One of the most important features in social networks is Team Formation. Team Formation aims to assemble a set of users with a set of skills required for a certain task. The team formation is a special type of recommendation which is important to enable cooperative work among users. Team formation is challenging since users’ interaction time is limited in MANET. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a peer-to-peer team formation technique based on zone routing protocol (ZRP). A comparison was made with Flooding and Adaptive Location Aided Mobile Ad Hoc Network Routing (ALARM) techniques. The suggested technique achieves fast successful recommendations within the limited mobile resources and reduces exchanged messages. The suggested technique has fast response time, small required buffering and low power consumption. The testing results show better performance of the suggested technique compared to flooding and ALARM technique.
A Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network comprised of clusters of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones that communicate while nearby. FANETs are increasingly used in a variety of applications, including smart ports, delivery of products, construction, monitoring of the environment and climate, and military surveillance. FANETs research is being driven by the potential for UAVs to be utilized in these regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most important FANET characteristics, mobility models, applications, and routing protocols. The present paper is an effort to provide a comprehensive description of the various routing techniques utilized by the most prevalent routing protocols in FANETs, including topology-based, position- based, hierarchical, swarm-based, and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. Reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning are both encompassed in a newly anticipated classification. In the meanwhile, this study primarily centres around the taxonomy for learning agents (single- agent, multi-agent) and learning models (model-based and free-model). In addition, the paper intends to shed light on identifying the applications of FANETs in various categories and identify research gaps and future opportunities in this field. In addition, it compares the results qualitatively to those of the previous surveys. Any future work on the FANET routing protocol could benefit from this paper as a reference and roadmap.

This review aimed to conduct an indirect comparison using a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy and safety of delafloxacin versus other single antibiotic regimens for the empiric treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections.          A systematic search with no start date restrictions was conducted. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the quality of included RCTs.          Of the 577 studies initially identified, nine RCTs were included in the review. The network meta-analysis showed that ceftaroline, ceftobiprole, delafloxacin and tigecycline had similar efficacy in the indirect comparisons [Ceftaroline Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.2, 95% Crl = 0.46–3.6), ceftobiprole (OR = 1.3, 95% Crl = 0.34–3.0) and tigecycline (OR = 0.96, 95% Crl = 0.30–2.9)]. However, the ranking plot for the intention to treat (ITT) population showed that delafloxacin had a probability of 80.8% to be ranked first followed by ceftobiprole (13.1%). The analysis of the overall adverse events showed that ceftaroline (OR = 0.88, 95% Crl = 0.65–1.2), ceftobiprole (OR = 1.1, 95% Crl = 0.69–2.0), delafloxacin (OR = 0.88, 95% Crl = 0.57–1.3) and tigecycline (OR = 1.4, 95% Crl = 0.88–2.2) had similar safety profiles.          Delafloxacin did not show any statistically significant differences when compared to ceftaroline, ceftobiprole, and tigecycline in terms of efficacy and safety. However, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability ranked delafloxacin as the first option for the ITT population.
This work introduces a real-time temporary grounding monitoring system integrated with the supervisory system.        Effective monitoring of the active or inactive status of temporary grounding in substations and transmission lines.        Application of mesh network technology for monitoring the state of temporary grounding.        Results demonstrate the system’s viability in environments with high electromagnetic interference.              The importance of grounding techniques is undeniable in ensuring the safety of workers involved in high-voltage systems. During maintenance routines, using multiple grounding cables is common; however, individually verifying if each cable is correctly connected can be challenging. This work presents an innovative proposal to control and check the connection state of grounding cables listed in a maintenance routine at a predefined point. The proposed solution employs electronic devices that create mesh networks, significantly improving safety levels. Through real-time monitoring, the system allows quick and accurate identification of potential failures or disconnections in the grounding cables. This feature plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the maintenance team, averting accidents linked to grounding issues. Field tests performed in real substation and transmission tower environments validated the system’s resilience, showcasing its adeptness in managing communication interferences effectively. The results showed that the system is highly reliable, providing essential and precise information to the maintenance team. Implementing this real-time monitoring system for the temporary grounding connection status represents a significant advancement in the safety of maintenance operations at substations. By offering a comprehensive view of the status of each grounding cable, the system enables more appropriate decision-making and swift interventions in case of issues. The goal is to minimize risks and ensure a safer working environment for the high-voltage team that maintains the systems.
Maritime communication plays a crucial role in fields such as ocean resource exploration and marine environmental monitoring. Existing maritime communication methods either face challenges in equipment deployment or are limited by high power requirements, making sustained operation difficult. The emergence of LoRa presents an opportunity in this regard, with its characteristics of low power consumption and long communication range, meeting the demands for long-term maritime communication. However, LoRa’s underlying implementation is not open-source, and LoRaWAN itself adopts a star topology, limiting communication between nodes. Therefore, we have devised a communication packet header working at the application layer to enable peer-to-peer communication between nodes. Our on-campus field tests have shown that our system can achieve node-to-node communication, networking functionalities, with a packet delivery rate more than 94%, and max data transmission rate can achieve 1027 bps. In the sea test, the communication rate of our node remained basically around 1035 bps due to the absence of objects blocking the line of sight, and packet delivery rate was more than 96%.The byte error rates of all experiments were less than 0.5%.
Connectivity and diagnosability are two important metrics in evaluating the fault tolerability of a network. The     -extra connectivity and the     -extra conditional diagnosability are both defined under the restraint that every component of the network removing a faulty vertex set has at least              fault-free vertices. The              -diagnosability is an outstanding diagnosis strategy, in which the identified faulty vertex set is allowed to contain at most      fault-free vertices. As a well-known model for a large-scale data center network (DCN) with a server-centric structure, the     -dimensional DCell with     -port switches and                                   , has many desirable properties. In this paper, we first investigate the     -extra connectivity of                                      . Based on this, we establish the     -extra conditional diagnosability of                   under the PMC model for                     . Finally, we evaluate the              -diagnosability of                   under the PMC model for
The orientation of unidirectional carbon fibers (UDCFs) in a manufacturing process is critical to the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). This study presents a method to monitor the orientation of UDCFs on a mold using electrical resistance during the CFRP manufacturing process. An equivalent electrical model for UDCFs was proposed to develop an in situ sensor in a mold. The orientation of UDCFs during the CFRP manufacturing process is investigated in terms of its orthotropic electrical properties. The proposed technique can have strong implications on in situ monitoring of composite molding process where the fiber orientation is unseen by monitoring electrical resistance with Cu tapes as electrodes.       Graphical Abstract                                           Fiber orientation and the corresponding electrical resistance was correlated.        Analogous 3D model for electrical route was proposed with empirical rationales.        Fiber orientation in a mold can be detected by electrical resistance monitoring.        Fiber orientation monitoring is available during the composite manufacturing.
Motivated by the gateway placement problem in wireless networks, we consider the   geometric k-centre   problem on unit disc graphs: given a set of points      in the plane, find a set          points in the plane that minimizes the maximum graph distance from any vertex in      to the nearest vertex in      in the unit disc graph induced by             . We show that the vertex 1-centre provides a 7-approximation of the geometric 1-centre and that a vertex     -centre provides a 13-approximation of the geometric     -centre, resulting in an                   -time 26-approximation algorithm. We describe                      -time and                    -time algorithms, respectively, for finding exact and approximate geometric 1-centres, and an                         -time algorithm for finding a geometric     -centre for any fixed     . We show that the problem is NP-hard when      is an arbitrary input parameter. Finally, we describe an                 -time algorithm for finding a geometric     -centre in one dimension.
A wireless multihop network (WMN) is set of wirelessly connected nodes without an aid of centralized infrastructure that can forward any packets via intermediate nodes by a multihop fashion. In the WMN, there are still some issues that need to be resolved, like due to any source node may choose an uncertainty path to send their packets through the multihop fashion and this leads to the performance of network capacity can degrade drastically. To solve this problem, in this research, we propose two novel path selection algorithms called SNR-based learning path selection (NLPS) algorithm and SINR-based learning path selection (INLPS) algorithm, which are incorporated with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select the best multihop path from any source node to a destination node with highest end-to-end (E2E) throughput. Besides that, a factor graph (FG) approach and a nested lattice code (NLC) representation are used to reduce the computation time. According to the numerical studies with the NLC is applied, our simulation results reveal that the proposed NLPS and INLPS algorithms can improve the overall average network capacity up to 3.1 times and 10.5 times compared to FG, respectively. However, the overall average computation time are highly increased for NLPS and INLPS, i.e., about 0.627 s and 1.221 s, respectively compared to FG, which is about 0.006 s. In other words, both NLPS and INLPS algorithms can achieve high network capacity and moderate computation time.                       Proposing a novel fDRL scheme to optimize network capacity and reduce computation time in WMNs;        Using the FG approach, the fDRL scheme selects the best root node and reduces DRL computation time; and        Applying NLC to data transmission in tree-based WMNs reduces the total number of transmissions.
The scalable Video is the most suitable video format for the current day scenario where there are different varieties of electronic gadgets used to communicate and play back. As the device resolution varies, the codec designed for Scalable video (H.264/AVC) is the only solution for its support. But the challenge is in its transmission due to the limited network resources in wireless networks viz; bandwidth. This introduces jitter during video playback. This needs an effective Compression technique to reduce the possible transmission time. The paper presents a novel Adaptive Dual Tree Complex wavelet Transoform (ADT-CWT) using the efficient Motion Block Estimation (MBE), Diamond search with Large Diamond Search Path (LDSP) and a Small Diamond Search Path (SDSP). This technique effectively improves the performance of Scalable Video in wireless transmission. The PSNR and the Compression Ratio (CR) are considered for the comparison.
We are currently developing a modular and decentralized learning factory to demonstrate Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 scenarios to both, students and employees from the companies. The factory shall allow the setup and evaluation of any preferred factory layout. One major challenge is the design of an appropriate strategy for communication between the factory modules and the identification of adequate communication technologies. There are two main requirements, which we consider for the communication design. First, the communication shall be wireless in order to reduce the effort for changing the factory structure. Second, the communication strategy shall allow an easy identification of the current factory layout and the interconnection of factory resources. According to our current state of knowledge, we believe that LiFi (Light Fidelity) is a suitable technology to fulfill these requirements. In the paper, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of LiFi as communication technology and present a concept for the integration of LiFi in our learning factory.
To track movements of objects and people we need to use expensive technologies and complex softwares. Usually these softwares need lots of memory. There are many examples of objects and people of which would be useful to know the precise locations. Something sent via pony express, position of buses in the city, friends’ locations, and so on. Our purpose is to use connectivity of smartphone to share position via gps by using only a filesystem created ad hoc without databases or user space programs. IFHNFS is based on Hixosfs and NFS (Linux kernel). Indexing the most relevant data directly in the fs structure makes the exchange of data Faster and, via NFS, potentially available whenever and whenever. Ad-hoc solutions for Android have been developed in real contexts. The system have been tested on a network of Android OS devices that share data with a Linux server.

The new LSA is to be exploited for building a topology database based on realistic energy and Co2 emission data about each link and the sections of the network. The energy-aware CSPF mechanism can use this topology database to incorporate energy and emission information in routing data traffic form greener sections of network.
Vibration-based Condition Monitoring (CM) is an essential tool for identifying potential defects in industrial machinery. However, the implementation of an efficient CM system often necessitates the use of high-cost accelerometers with a large bandwidth. To address this challenge, this study introduces a low-cost CM sensor composed of an ultrasonic MEMS microphone - SPH0641LU and an ADXL1002 MEMS accelerometer. The combination of these two sensor types allows for comparative analysis of the captured data. The SPH641LU microphone is capable of detecting audible vibration signals with a frequency range up to 80 kHz, while the ADXL1002 accelerometer can measure vibrations up to 21 kHz. In addition a three axis ultra low power accelerometer is included, allowing measurement of unbalance or rotating speed, below 200Hz. Moreover, the sensor is designed to operate on battery power and provides the capability for raw data transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or the transmission of pre-processed features from the raw data using LoRaWAN.

This paper addresses two main aspects related to the application of the IEEE 802.11ad technology in an industrial environment, i.e., to guarantee a low latency and reliable data delivery while reducing the number of the deployed Access Points (APs). First, we discuss the parameter settings of the IEEE802.11ad MAC which guarantee a low delay by exploiting the synchronous service periods (SPs) mechanism. Then, we propose a binary linear programming model to enhance the reliability of the system under the Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER). The model minimizes the number of deployed APs by taking into account the constraints on the available synchronous SPs. We also propose two heuristics, based on the described mathematical model, in order to efficiently solve the design problem, then compare the computational performance of the proposed approaches. The reported computational results highlight the complementary features of the compared methods and provide useful guidelines about the usage of the proposed approaches.
With the rapid development of mobile internet and Internet of Things applications, the conventional centralized cloud computing is encountering severe challenges, such as high latency, low Spectral Efficiency (SE), and non-adaptive machine type of communication. Motivated to solve these challenges, a new technology is driving a trend that shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to edge devices of networks. Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication have been emerging. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial on three typical edge computing technologies, namely mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications of these three technologies are summarized and compared. From the viewpoint of radio access network, the differences between mobile edge computing and fog computing are highlighted, and the characteristics of fog computing-based radio access network are discussed. Finally, open issues and future research directions are identified as well.
We extend threshold models by analyzing coordination dynamics within adoption.        We analyze temporal correlations in activation as they emerge in networks.        We show that homogenous networks are more conducive to large-scale coordination.        The social influence parameter needs to reach a critical value for coordination to emerge.        The critical value that allows large-scale coordination changes across network topologies.              Demonstrations, protests, riots, and shifts in public opinion respond to the coordinating potential of communication networks. Digital technologies have turned interpersonal networks into massive, pervasive structures that constantly pulsate with information. Here, we propose a model that aims to analyze the contagion dynamics that emerge in networks when repeated activation is allowed, that is, when actors can engage recurrently in a collective effort. We analyze how the structure of communication networks impacts on the ability to coordinate actors, and we identify the conditions under which large-scale coordination is more likely to emerge.
In this paper, we consider the problem of recognizing whether a given network is a rectangular mesh. We present an efficient distributed algorithm with an O(    ) message and time complexity, where      is the number of nodes in the network. This is an improvement of a previous algorithm presented in Mohan (1990) with a message complexity of O(        ) and time complexity of O(       ). The proposed algorithm is constructive in nature and also assigns coordinates to the nodes of the network.

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) are provisionally connected networks with no permanent infrastructure. A mobile ad hoc network is a self-organized and energetically reconfigurable wireless network without wired infrastructure and central administration. Nodes in the mobile ad hoc network can immediately create a communication structure while each node moves in a random way. Multicasting is capable of performing required services for ad hoc applications. The dynamic nature of the network topology and limited resources, maintaining and finding the path for multicasting data is still further challenging. Several protocols have been designed for multicasting in mobile ad hoc networks. On demand multicast routing protocol is one such protocol. ODMRP is mesh based and on-demand protocol that uses forwarding group to communicate a mesh for each multicasting group. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to find the stable path selection in ODMRP for forwarding packets. The basic on demand multicast routing protocol path selection uses minimum delay principle. The proposed algorithm considers node energy in path selection from source to destination. This article discusses the studies on output parameters such as control overhead and end to end delay by varying the input parameters viz., multicast groups size and mobility in the developed algorithm. Experimental results confirm that this approach can improve stability of path due to node energy consumption.
LoRa is widely used in various applications, which has gained increasing popularity in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). However, in legacy LoRa protocols, bidirectional communications and low power consumption cannot be achieved simultaneously, hindering the further development of LoRa. In this study, a long preamble wake-up communication (LPWC) protocol is proposed to alleviate the aforementioned issue. This scheme is performed at both sides of communication: (1) LoRa nodes are designed to sleep periodically to save more power; (2) LoRa gateway must send packets with long preamble to maintain the reliability of downlink communication. In addition, an energy model is built to prove that an optimal cycle period exists for LoRa nodes to save more energy. Then we implement simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in various cases. Results show that LPWC outperforms LoRaWAN Class B mode in terms of power conservation and packet latency.
The integration of mobile robots into various applications, operating collaboratively in groups known as platoons, presents challenges in communication, control, and synchronization. This paper introduces a control solution for mobile robot platoons based on a DMPC algorithm and the ZigBee protocol for V2V communication. This communication standard was selected for its low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and reliable data transmission over short distances. Furthermore, a testbed and methodology for the experimental evaluation of the proposed control solution were developed. The results demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed control and communication solutions.       Graphical abstract                                      Proposed control solution for cooperative mobile robots in logistics applications.        The communication between robots is based on the ZigBee protocol.        Testbed using BIG8051 and MRF24J40 for vehicular communication and control testing.
Chen et al. proposed in 2004 a new hierarchy structure, called the enhanced pyramid network (EPM), by replacing each mesh in a pyramid network (PM) with a torus. Recently, some topological properties and communication on an EPM have been investigated or derived. Their measurement results indicate that an EPM is an attractive alternative to a PM. This study investigates the node-disjoint paths between any two distinct nodes and computes upper and lower bounds of          -wide diameters of an EPM. After minimizing upper bounds and maximizing lower bounds,          -wide diameters of an EPM can then be determined.
This study reveals for a creation of a system that has the ability to prove the technical feasibility and the advantages of a joint Radio Frequency and fiber optic system with self-trace directional control between deployed network nodes in the low space. Sky's mesh network utilizing aerial altitude platform stations (AAPS) are driven via Wi-Fi and optical fiber to support and strengthen the capacity of network nodes by acquiring high quality coverage. The mechanism of AAPS Face a real challenge of precariousness due to winds; this challenge hinders network deployment due to loss of the line of sight (LoS). A smart communication platform system (SCPS) base station is proposed to overcome the limitations. Research aimed to evaluate the SCPS mechanism, to verify aptitude of system performance which is used to handling and supporting the communication networks in disaster areas.
The advent of virtualization and cloud computing has fundamentally changed how distributed applications and services are deployed and managed. With the proliferation of IoT and mobile devices, virtualized systems akin to those offered by cloud providers are increasingly needed geographically near the network’s edge to perform processing tasks in proximity to the data sources and sinks. Latency-sensitive, bandwidth-intensive applications can be decomposed into workflows that leverage resources at the edge — a model referred to as fog computing. Not only is performance important, but a trustworthy network is fundamental to guaranteeing privacy and integrity at the network layer. This paper describes Bounded Flood, a novel technique that enables virtual private Ethernet networks that span edge and cloud resources — including those constrained by NAT and firewall middleboxes. Bounded Flood builds upon a scalable structured peer-to-peer overlay, and is novel in how it integrates overlay tunnels with SDN software switches to create a virtual network with dynamic membership — supporting unmodified Ethernet/IP stacks to facilitate the deployment of edge applications. Bounded Flood has been implemented as the core of the EdgeVPN open-source virtual private network software system for edge computing. Experiments with the software demonstrate its functionality and scalability — one of which includes Kubernetes with Flannel across Raspberry Pi 4 edge devices behind different NATs.                       Peer-to-peer overlay self-organizes Ethernet virtual private network        Native edge-to-edge traversal of Network Address Translators (NATs)        Bounded flood software-defined networking enables scalable broadcasting        Virtual network supports unmodified Kubernetes Flannel edge/cloud middleware
Global warming is one of the most serious issues faced by today's world. The increase in world population and adoption of modern lifestyle have dramatically increased the demand for energy. Over the last decade Higher Educational Institution (HEI) buildings have seen massive increase in energy consumption due to increased use of IT equipments, longer occupancy and increased use of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current Building Management Systems (BMS) fail to optimize energy consumption of HVAC systems in commercial and educational buildings. In this paper we present an intelligent agent based system to optimize energy consumption of HVAC system in HEI buildings. The system employs artificial intelligence techniques to predict the demand of the system and optimize energy consumption of the HVAC system. The experimental results have shown that the deployment of the system has resulted in 3% reduction in energy consumption of HVAC.
Software updates are highly significant in autonomous vehicles. These updates are utilized to provide enhanced features and updated security mechanisms. In order to ensure scalability and smooth roll-out Over-the-air (OTA) mechanism is a preferred option to propagate a software update. However, this approach is vulnerable to security attacks because of existence of wireless communication channel between the vehicle and the manufacturer. In that, an attacker can replace the legitimate software with a malicious software with an intent to get control over the vehicle. In this work, we are motivated to address this problem. We develop an enhanced uptane framework for detection of malicious OTA software updates in autonomous vehicles. For enhancing security, we incorporate convolutional neural network (CNN) in the uptane framework. The proposed framework is able to distinguish between malicious and benign software executables with high accuracy. For training and testing, we create two datasets by collecting executables of Windows and Linux operating system. We encourage the use of transfer learning by exploiting the developed CNN models in order to detect malicious executable designed for autonomous vehicles. We also benchmark the CNN models against state-of-the art models. Our work is highly beneficial for the community in providing a secure mechanism for software updates.
Efficient delivery of content to areas where terrestrial Internet service is unavailable can be possible via content caching at low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Cached content in several LEO satellites must be delivered via inter-satellite links (ISLs) with appropriate routing techniques. Until now, content caching and routing techniques have been optimized independently. To tackle this issue, the optimization of selecting a content-cached satellite and routing is jointly performed, using the example of Earth observation data cached across multiple satellites. In this paper, we first formulate a dynamic power minimization problem constrained by the queue stability of all LEO satellites, where the control variables are the selection of content-cached satellite and routing in every satellite. To solve this long-term time-averaged problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization framework to transform the original problem into a series of slot-by-slot problems. Moreover, we prove that the average power consumption and the average queue backlog by the proposed algorithm can be upper-bounded via theoretical analysis. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses existing independent content-retrieval algorithms in terms of power consumption, queue backlog, and fairness.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provides good services through Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) platform. These networks encounter various challenges to support voice calls with acceptable Quality of Service (QoS). The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is used to investigate the performance of VoIP applications in the VANET network. The network was tested before and after running the OLSR algorithm, the testing focused on Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like end-to-end delay, delay variation (jitter), and probability of packet loss between two moving hops through multi-hop Ad-hoc networks in different scenarios, using the ITU G.711 VoIP codec. After measured the end-to-end delay, jitter, and probability of packet loss for two nodes the algorithm decreased delay by 18.72%, while decreased jitter by about 20.42% and decreased packet loss by about 128.6%. However, The OLSR has shown initial good performance for four hops, and then added more hops the delay exceeded 400 ms which is not acceptable according to ITU-T recommendations. This was achieved by implementing a testbed to extract the desired results as opposed to using a simulation.
Graphical abstract                               The rational search for allosteric modulators and the allosteric mechanisms of these modulators in the presence of mutations is a relatively unexplored field. Here, we established novel   in silico   approaches and applied them to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M     ) as a case study. First, we identified six potential allosteric modulators. Then, we focused on understanding the allosteric effects of these modulators on each of its protomers. We introduced a new combinatorial approach and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis algorithms to examine patterns of change and conservation of critical nodes, according to five independent criteria of network centrality. We observed highly conserved network hubs for each averaged DRN metric on the basis of their existence in both protomers in the absence and presence of all ligands (  persistent hubs  ). We also detected ligand specific signal changes. Using   eigencentrality (EC) persistent hubs   and ligand introduced hubs we identified a residue communication path connecting the allosteric binding site to the catalytic site. Finally, we examined the effects of the mutations on the behavior of the protein in the presence of selected potential allosteric modulators and investigated the ligand stability. One crucial outcome was to show that      centrality hubs form an allosteric communication path between the allosteric ligand binding site to the active site going through the interface residues of domains I and II; and this path was either weakened or lost in the presence of some of the mutations. Overall, the results revealed crucial aspects that need to be considered in rational computational drug discovery.
This paper aims on a quality estimation of voice services in converged corporate networks. Besides the techno-centric Quality of Service (QoS) metrics a research area called Quality of Experience (QoE) provides metrics and methods for quality evaluation from the end-user's perspective. This contribution focuses on a QoE estimation of Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. Existing methods of voice quality estimation are compared on different voice codecs tested on a network topology suffering from distortions of real network. Finally, a regression analysis is employed to provide better understanding of impact of network conditions (delay, jitter, packet loss) on the VoIP service quality. The results can improve the voice quality monitoring systems in corporate networks.
With the development of information society and network technology, people increasingly depend on information found on the Internet. At the same time, the models of information diffusion on the Internet are changing as well. However, these models experience the problem due to the fast development of network technologies. There is no thorough research in regards to the latest models and their applications and advantages. As a result, it is essential to have a comprehensive study of information diffusion models.    The primary goal of this research is to provide a comparative study on the existing models such as the Ising model, Sznajd model, SIR model, SICR model, Game theory and social networking services models. We discuss several of their applications with the existing limitations and further categorizations. Vulnerabilities and privacy challenges of information diffusion models are extensively explored. Furthermore, categorization including strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, limitations and recommendations are suggested with diverse solutions for the improvement of the information diffusion models and envisioned future research directions.
Due to the absence of infrastructure support, secure data dissemination is a challenging task in scalable mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) environment. In most of the traditional routing techniques for MANETs, either security has not been taken into account or only one aspect of security concern has been addressed without optimizing the routing performance. This paper proposes Flooding Factor based Framework for Trust Management (F3TM) in MANETs. True flooding approach is utilized to identify attacker nodes based on the calculation of trust value. Route Discovery Algorithm is developed to discover an efficient and secure path for data forwarding using Experimental Grey Wolf algorithm for validating network nodes. Enhanced Multi-Swarm Optimization is used to optimize the identified delivery path. Simulations are carried out in ns2 to assess and compare the performance of F3TM with the state-of-the-art frameworks: CORMAN and PRIME considering the metrics including delay, packet delivery ration, overhead and throughput. The performance assessment attests the reliable security of F3TM compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks.
Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) have been developed as sensors and reactors to remediate polluted environment and facilitate online monitoring. However, their industrial feasibility is hampered by long startup times. In this paper, we demonstrated that SMFCs could be rapidly initiated by employing precultured anodes. The performance of precultured anodes in reducing startup times was strongly influenced by the duration of culture time. High-throughput sequencing techniques and community level physiological profiling (CLPP) methods were utilized to study the structural and functional diversity of the bacterial communities on incubated anodes. Results revealed that the collaborative role of organic matter degrading biofilms and electroactive biofilms on the anodes in expediting startup. Network interactions analysis further showed more compact co-occurrence patterns, less topological roles of individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and dominant modules were obtained after SMFCs setup. This was primarily due to the formation of more stable and higher microbial carbon metabolism functions anode biofilms. An optimal biomass level of 2000 μg protein cm      on the anode was typically achieved seven days after SMFCs initiation. Based on the results of laboratory experiments, the optimal start-up strategy was obtained, and successfully applied to the starting of in-situ on-line monitoring sensors. This study could realize the potential of SMFCs for large-scale field applications.       Graphical Abstract                                       SMFCs could be rapidly initiated by employing pre-cultured anodes.        The performance of pre-cultured anodes was strongly influenced by the duration of culture time.        Organic matter degrading and electroactive biofilms played the collaborative role in expediting startup.        Microbial carbon metabolism functions were closely related to the startup of SMFCs;         A optimal start-up strategy was successfully applied to a
The inclusion of renewable energy in the conventional grid system and the digitalization of the various aspects of the power system have precipitated the transformation of the traditional grid system to a smart grid. Key to the implementation of the smart grid is various communication technologies. The emerging dominance of communication technologies in power systems applications is pivotal to modernizing the conventional grid system. This research presented an overview of the application of communication technologies in the digitalization of the power systems network. It reviews smart grid communication technologies, their features, relevance, and various roles being played toward delivering an effective electrical service to stakeholders. Hence, this study focused on wireless and wired communication technologies applicable to smart grid applications. Based on the review, each communication technology has its strengths and weaknesses; hence in selecting the most appropriate technology for application in a smart grid, a compromise must be made. Therefore, for choosing the most preferred communication technology in any smart grid application, it is important to deploy the efficacy of multi-criteria methods. To serve as a case study, a framework for selecting a communication technology for advanced metering infrastructure is proposed and applied. Based on the spectrum, data rate, and coverage range, the study revealed that WiMAX communication technology is the most preferred, followed by Zigbee; the least preferred communication technology for smart grid communication is Power Line Communication (PLC).

This paper presents a new multicast routing protocol named as Mobility based Energy Efficient Multicast Protocol (M-EEMC). The aim of this protocol is minimizing the energy dissipation of the Mobile Ad-hoc network. This M-EEMC protocol is a combination of tree and mesh based routing scheme. This protocol is used to establish and maintain an active multicast tree surrounded by a passive mesh within a mobile ad hoc network. The multicast mesh is created by using route discovery concept. Pruning mechanism is used to eliminate the redundancies of mesh that is created by route discovery approach and it creates the multicast tree. M-EEMC effectively uses the knowledge of neighborhood node density and mobility so that they complement each other in discovering stable routes in a more energy-efficient fashion. Energy efficiency is achieved by eliminating most of the redundant data receptions. The proposed scheme is simulated over a large number of MANET nodes with wide range of mobility and the performance is evaluated. It is observed that proposed scheme produces better packet delivery ratio, less energy dissipation and reduced packet delay compared to on-demand multicast routing protocol (ODMRP).
We propose the use of an intelligent ticket that can be applied incorporating with the ordinary ticket, where in this case more digital information with for security application is included, especially, the personal data that can be available for security control. The use of the corporative functions such as GPS (Global Positioning System) data, seat positions and personal and identification data can be provide, in which the crime prevention in the sports, especially, in the stadium can be operated and realized.
Reactive-Greedy-Reactive (RGR) has been proposed as a promising routing protocol in highly mobile density-variable Unmanned Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (UAANETs). In RGR, location information of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as reactive end-to-end paths are employed in the routing process. It had already been shown that RGR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio. In this paper, the delay performance of RGR is evaluated and compared against Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Greedy Geographic Forwarding (GGF).We considerextensive simulation scenariostocover both searchingand tracking applicationsofUAANETs. The results illustrate that when the number of UAVs is high enough in a searching mission to form a connected UAANET, RGR performs well. In sparsely connected searching scenarios or dense tracking scenarios, RGR may also slightly decrease delay compared to traditional reactive routing protocols for similar PDR.
LoRaWAN is an upcoming Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology for Internet of Things implementations in various application domains. Despite its various advantages, LoRaWAN employs an Aloha-based MAC, which in terms of performance cannot guarantee high packet delivery ratio and low latency. To overcome this issue, we propose a time-slotted scheme, called TS-VP-LoRa, which supports multiple transmission times and packet sizes at the same time. In TS-VP-LoRa, scheduling is coordinated by the LoRa gateway, broadcasting beacon frames periodically for the synchronization of LoRa end-devices. A channel hopping mechanism is also proposed in order to minimize the occurrence of collisions and to evenly split the transmission load among all channels. TS-VP-LoRa is evaluated and compared to three other MAC-layer schemes in single gateway simulation scenarios with up to 500 nodes. The proposed scheme has proven to achieve low latency with high packet delivery ratios, significantly minimize collisions and maintain a relatively low energy consumption despite the scaling of the LoRa network.
Today, wireless multimedia applications are growing fastly and they require high bandwidth. Due to the limited spectrum resources, we cannot provide separate spectrum bands for each individual wireless multimedia application. Cognitive radio plays a vital role in providing spectrum resources to these applications. Cognitive radio enables wireless users to sense temporal and spatial unused channels and correspondingly adapt their transmission strategies. These unused channels may be occupied by the primary users(PUs) at any time, creating those channels unstable, which makes it difficult to meet the QoE requirement of secondary users using these unstable channels. Therefore it is essential to study how to manage the available spectrum resources among a set of secondary users based on their QoE requirement and stability of these channels. Historical QoE under different channels are investigated by SUs and these data are sent to cognitive radio base station(CRBS) and this base station allocates the channel based on QoE requirement and the historical data. At the time of any change in channel allocation due to arrival or departure of any user in the system, channel allocation should be modified such that degradation of QoE due to channel switching should be minimal.
Frame aggregation is one of the IEEE802.11n wireless networks features. In frame aggregation multiple frames are combined and then sent. However sending a large number of frames in one aggregation frame in an error-prone environment will result in massive frame loss and retransmission. Thus a prior knowledge about the state of the channel will help in selecting the proper aggregation size that would utilize the channel bandwidth and improve the system performance. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that adjusts the aggregation size based on the ACK bitmap without adding any extra headers or messages for determining the network conditions. Simulation results show that the Acknowledgment Bitmap can be used as an indicator of the network conditions to create adaptive frame aggregation schemes.
In this paper, the problem of routing messages along shortest paths in a network of processors without using complete routing tables is considered.    The Boolean Routing model is proposed and it is shown that it provides optimal representations of all shortest routes on some specific network topologies (such as paths, rings, trees, hypercubes, different types of     -dimensional grids, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs). Moreover, it is also shown that the model deals efficiently with graphs obtained by applying some types of graph compositions, thus resulting in very efficient routing schemes for some classes of networks with regular topology. This is done by considering different significant cost measures of the space efficiency of the schemes considered.
An unprecedented very large-scale T&D dataset covering Texas is made publicly available.        The sheer size of this dataset is intended to provide a challenge for the scientific community.        This lays the foundation for demonstrating the coordination of T&D.        It can help foster the improvement of algorithms and tools for years to come.               Distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, have rapidly expanded in recent years, given declining costs and the desire to reduce carbon emissions. With more energy resources located in the lower-voltage distribution system, it is increasingly helpful to utilize combined transmission and distribution (T&D) system models to analyze interactions between these normally-distinct subsystems. This paper proposes a methodology for creating very large-scale, highly detailed, combined T&D systems that are synthetic—that is, free from non-public data—yet still realistic. The methodology creates very large-scale combined T&D systems by merging the most up-to-date techniques for creating synthetic distribution feeder networks with the latest methods for building synthetic, meshed bulk-power transmission networks. This methodology is demonstrated on a T&D system geolocated in Texas, and benchmarked with co-simulation results. Validation demonstrates that the resulting     -texas-TDgrid synthetic test system realistically represents characteristics found in actual networks, addressing the lack of available T&D test systems. With over 15,000 feeders and 46 million electrical nodes, this T&D dataset has applications for research in optimal power flow algorithms, voltage control, reconfiguration, and T&D coordination schemes under high adoption of distributed energy resources.
Process monitoring and automation in the industrial sector are hitherto done over wired connection between devices. It is evident that the amount of wires required increased proportionally to the complexity of the industry and their installation is time consuming. The wires used in the industry must withstand the harsh environmental conditions, hence expensive to install and maintain. In the event of loss of connection due to accident or any other reason, the cost incurred as a result of the downtime is high. The highlighted problems necessitated the need for an open, interoperable wireless standard like WirelessHART that can overcome these problems. Three categories of applications running in any process plant with increment of criticality are for monitoring, control and safety. The current application of wireless technology including WirelessHART in the industry so far is limited to monitoring and some attempts are being made to apply it for control. This paper examines the extent to which WirelessHART technology is applied especially for the purpose of control.
Two control modes were developed for a B2B VSCs based SOP.        The SOP operating principle was investigated under various network conditions.        The performance of the SOP using two control modes was analyzed.               Soft Open Points (SOPs) are power electronic devices installed in place of normally-open points in electrical power distribution networks. They are able to provide active power flow control, reactive power compensation and voltage regulation under normal network operating conditions, as well as fast fault isolation and supply restoration under abnormal conditions. Two control modes were developed for the operation of an SOP, using back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). A power flow control mode with current control provides independent control of real and reactive power. A supply restoration mode with a voltage controller enables power supply to isolated loads due to network faults. The operating principle of the back-to-back VSCs based SOP was investigated under both normal and abnormal network operating conditions. Studies on a two-feeder medium-voltage distribution network showed the performance of the SOP under different network-operating conditions: normal, during a fault and post-fault supply restoration. During the change of network operating conditions, a mode switch method based on the phase locked loop controller was used to achieve the transitions between the two control modes. Hard transitions by a direct mode switching were noticed unfavourable, but seamless transitions were obtained by deploying a soft cold load pickup and voltage synchronization process.
In practice, transient gas transport problems frequently have to be solved for large-scale gas networks. Gas network optimization problems typically belong to the class of Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Problems (MINLP). However current state-of-the-art MINLP solvers are not yet mature enough to solve large-scale real-world instances. Therefore, an established approach in practice is to solve the problems with respect to a coarser representation of the network and thereby reducing the size of the underlying model. Two well-known aggregation methods that effectively reduce the network size are parallel and serial pipe merges. However, these methods have only been studied in stationary gas transport problems so far. This paper closes this gap and presents parallel and serial pipe merging methods for transient gas transport problems. An empirical evaluation indicates that the developed methods perform very accurately on a huge set of fine-grained real-world data taken from one of the largest transmission system operators in Europe.                       First approaches to pipe merging in transient gas networks.        Development of an equivalent parallel pipe merging method.        Counterexample to equivalent serial pipe merging.        Development of a sampling based regression approach for serial pipe merging.        Empirical evaluation on a huge data set of real-world gas network operations.
Cellular networks are one of today’s most popular means of communication. This fact has made the mobile phone industry subject to a huge scientific and economic competition, where the quality of service is key. Such a quality is measured on the basis of reliability, speed and accuracy when delivering a service to a user no matter his location or behaviour are. This fact has placed the users’ tracking process among the most difficult and determining issues in cellular network design. In this paper, we present an adaptive bi-phased evolutionary algorithm based on the takeover time to solve this problem. The proposal is thoroughly assessed by tackling twenty-five real-world instances of different sizes. Twenty-eight of the state-of-the-art techniques devised to address the users’ mobility problem have been taken as the comparison basis, and several statistical tests have been also conducted. Experiments have demonstrated that our solver outperforms most of the top-ranked algorithms.                       Adaptive metaheuristics to solve the mobile user tracking problem in cellular networks.        Adaptation is dynamic and based on the future behaviour of the algorithm.        Uses a mathematical model to forecast the future behaviour of the algorithm.        Tests over 25 realistic networks and comparison against 28 top-ranked algorithms.        Experiments showed that the proposed approach is more efficient.
This paper reports on the design of a test chip built to test a) a new latency insensitive network fabric protocol and circuits, b) a new synchronizer design, and c) how efficiently one can synchronize into a clocked domain when elastic interfaces are utilized. Simulations show that the latency insensitive network allows excellent characterization of network performance in terms of the cost of routing, amount of blocking due to congestion, and message buffering. The network routers show that peak performance near 100% link utilization is achieved under congestion and combining. This enables accurate high-level modeling of the behavior of the network fabric so that optimized network design, including placement and routing, can occur through high-level network synthesis tools. The chip also shows that when elastic interfaces are used at the boundary of clock synchronization points then efficient domain crossings can occur. Buffering at the synchronization points are required to allow for variability in clocking frequencies and correct data transmission. The asynchronous buffering and synchronization scheme is shown to perform over four times faster than the clocked interface.

Brualdi and Massey defined the incidence coloring number of a graph and bounded itby the maximum degree. They conjectured that every graph can be incidence colored with Δ + 2 colors, where Δ is the maximum degree of a graph. Guiduli disproved the conjecture. However, Shiu   et al  . considered graphs with Δ = 3 and showed that the conjecture holds for cubic Hamiltonian graphs and some other cubic graphs. This work presents methods of incidence coloring of square meshes, hexagonal meshes, and honeycomb meshes. The meshes can be incidence colored with Δ + 1 colors.
Sensor network collects electrical and environmental data from photovoltaic modules.        NodeMCU board, running Tasmota firmware, extracts sensor data and sends it to Raspberry Pi through MQTT over Wi-Fi.        Raspberry Pi acts as a data processing unit with MQTT Mosquitto broker and sends data to Node-RED.        Node-RED processes data using MQTT input node, JSON node, change node, and InfluxDB output node.        InfluxDB database stores processed data and Grafana dashboard visualizes it.              The development of photovoltaic (PV) technology has led to an increasing demand for efficient and reliable monitoring systems that can ensure the optimal performance of PV modules. In particular, remote monitoring systems are critical for PV systems installed in distant locations where manual monitoring is difficult and expensive. In this article, we introduce a low-cost wireless monitoring system that employs NodeMCU boards, Raspberry Pi, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor and analyze the operational and environmental data of PV modules. By using free and open-source software packages including MQTT Mosquitto Broker, InfluxDB, Node-RED, and Grafana, the system can collect, store, and visualize data, offering an effective means of studying a PV system performance from anywhere. The proposed system is found to work efficiently under different testing conditions; providing precise measurements for different parameters, including voltage, current, power, ambient temperature, humidity, panel temperature, PV coolant temperature at inlet and outlet, and spectral irradiance. In addition to the data collected by the set of sensors, the system provides another source of environmental data using a web-based service called "OpenWeatherMap" that provides a complete global forecast. Alerts and thresholds have been successfully implemented in our system, providing an added advantage of being able to detect and respond to any anomalies in the collected data. Furthermore, the system provides two operational controls: wireless ON/OFF control and wireless control of a servo motor which can be utilized in various applications improving overall system performance.

This paper investigates the scalability issues concerned with the dynamic SLA negotiation mechanism proposed in the previous study. The previous work presented a dynamic service level agreement negotiation mechanism considering intra- and inter-domain communications over shared mesh optical networks which may cause heavy control overheads in a dynamic environment such as the control plane of GMPLS-based networks. In this paper, two main issues regarding the dynamic propagation of information will be analyzed: i) control overhead, and ii) propagation delay. The paper employs some alternative means of communication to reduce the overheads and resolve the possible scalability issues.
The study of ad hoc networks and their different varieties, including wireless sensor networks, wireless mesh networks, and mobile ad hoc networks, is discussed in this paper. Wireless devices link to one another directly in an ad hoc network without the use of a central Wireless Access Point (WAP). Data transit between wireless devices is frequently managed and directed by a base station or WAP device. As soon as two or more devices converse with one another, an ad hoc network is instantaneously created. Although placing these devices close to one another is preferred, the network's quality and speed will decline as more devices join it. The idea of a vehicular ad hoc network, an intelligent vehicular ad hoc network, and a mobile ad hoc network is also introduced in ad hoc networks since nodes travel from one point to another. Any node can join and exit this network at any time. Nodes are mobile systems or gadgets that are a part of the network, like a mobile phone, laptop, personal digital assistant, MP3 player, or personal computer. Apart from this, the paper also discusses the most important results from 2000 to 2022 from various authors. In addition, the paper contrasts mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks in terms of their uses, limitations, issues, characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of routing protocols. The most important things for ad hoc networks are that the different types of nodes (end-to-end nodes, intermediate nodes, and wireless antennas) are safe and respond quickly.
The list-ranking problem is considered for parallel computers which communicate through an interconnection network. Each PU holds      nodes of a set of linked lists. A novel randomized algorithm gives a considerable improvement over earlier ones: for a large class of networks and sufficiently large     , it takes only twice the number of steps required by a          routing. For hypercubes the condition is                ). Even better results are achieved for     -dimensional meshes: we show that the ranking time exceeds the routing time only by lower-order terms for all                ). We also show that list-ranking requires at least the time required for          routing. Thus, the results are within a factor two from optimal, those for meshes even match the lower bound up to lower-order terms.
Ship Information Systems (SISs) have been one of the main research focuses in ship design and become a multidisciplinary area. With these growing research trends, it is important to consolidate the latest knowledge and information to keep up with the research needs. In this paper, the SIS and its different forms are introduced and discussed. The beginning of this paper discusses the history and evolution of SIS. The next part of this paper focuses on different fields and research areas such as networking technology, information fusion, information decision, message display, ship control in real-time SISs. A Semi-Physical Simulation Platform (SPSIM) designed for SIS research and its running effect through a new Fuzzy-PID fusion algorithm are introduced in this paper then. A brief literature survey and possible future direction concerning each topic is included.
In this paper, we consider two problems: the   edge coloring   and the   strong edge coloring   problems on unit disk graphs (UDGs). Both problems have important applications in wireless sensor networks as they can be used to model link scheduling problems in such networks. It is well known that both problems are NP-complete, and approximation algorithms for them have been extensively studied under the centralized model of computation. Centralized algorithms, however, are not suitable for ad hoc wireless sensor networks whose devices typically have limited resources, and lack the centralized coordination.     We develop local distributed approximation algorithms for the   edge coloring   and the   strong edge coloring   problems on unit disk graphs. For the   edge coloring   problem, our local distributed algorithm has approximation ratio 2 and locality 50. For the   strong edge coloring   problem on UDGs, we present two local distributed algorithms with different tradeoffs between their approximation ratio and locality. The first algorithm has ratio 128 and locality 22, whereas the second algorithm has ratio 10 and locality 180.
For billions of people, mobile phones have become essential communication means to produce and share multimedia contents. Most current sharing solutions rely on centralized online solutions, requiring a permanent Internet connectivity, with the conse- quence of increasing –and sometimes of overloading– the networks of mobile operators.    This paper presents an anycast communication model allowing to offload data in wide intermittently-connected hybrid networks, using a peer-to-peer approach. Such networks combine an infrastructure part that relies on fixed equipments with intermittently or partially connected parts formed by mobile devices. This model has been implemented in a middleware platform called Nephila. Simulation results confirm that, with Nephila, thousands of people roaming a medium-size city center can share multimedia con- tents, using a combination of stable and transient transmission links.
The 6G smart fog radio access network (F-RAN) is an integration of 6G network intelligence technologies and the F-RAN architecture. Its aim is to provide low-latency and high-performance services for massive access devices. However, the performance of current 6G network intelligence technologies and its level of integration with the architecture, along with the system-level requirements for the number of access devices and limitations on energy consumption, have impeded further improvements in the 6G smart F-RAN. To better analyze the root causes of the network problems and promote the practical development of the network, this study used structured methods such as segmentation to conduct a review of the topic. The research results reveal that there are still many problems in the current 6G smart F-RAN. Future research directions and difficulties are also discussed.
Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) is the MAC layer amendment introduced in 2012 in IEEE 802.15.4 standard for supporting industrial applications. TSCH aims at providing low power and high reliability to industrial networks. The communication in TSCH is handled by a schedule, that indicates when a node will transmit the data. Each cell in a schedule is identified with the tuple (time slot, channel offset). A group of time slots constitutes a slot-frame. The number of time-slots with in a slot-frame is termed as slot-frame length. This paper investigates the effect of slot-frame length on energy consumption using 6TiSCH simulator and ANOVA method. A cubic regression equation best fits the simulation results and the predicted values were in good agreement with the simulation results. The slot-frame length optimization is done using Hill Climbing. The energy consumption can be improved significantly through optimised slot-frame length.
The perfect hierarchical hypercube structure was proposed in the literature as a topology for interconnection networks of massively parallel systems. It has the useful ability that it can connect many nodes while retaining a low degree as well as a small diameter. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm solving the node-to-set disjoint-path routing problem in a perfect hierarchical hypercube. Inside a (2      + m)-perfect hierarchical hypercube, given one source node and a set of k (≤ m + 1) destination nodes, this algorithm finds k disjoint paths between the source node and all destination nodes of lengths at most m2      + 2      + 2      + 4 in O(km2     ) time complexity.
The methods usually employed to measure channel occupancy show limitations in the context of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements. We propose and analyze the use of BLE sniffers as light and portable low-cost spectrum occupancy meters to be used in scenarios where real time signal analyzers are not adequate. For the measurement technique to be successful, several low-level effects must be considered. The paper argues about on-air time, receiving blind times due to processing and intra system interference, buffer saturation and frequency anchoring. Hence, a compensation procedure based on collision rate estimation is proposed. Results with the refined method show that occupancies of 40% can be measured with an overestimation error whose percentile 95% is 5 percentage points. This is reduced to 1.9 points when the occupancy is 15%. The sniffers perform in real time and are shown to correctly track short term load variations. The strategy has been successfully used to characterize occupancy in highly variable and loaded scenarios such as subway platforms and a shopping mall. Values up to 25% have been observed, which implies a relevant packet error rate. Hence, the tool can be used to make agile audits and configure the parameters that control communication redundancy in new or existing networks.
In this paper we describe the design of a home energy and comfort management system. The system has three components such as a smart plug with a wireless module, a residential gateway and a mobile app. The combined system is called a home energy management and comfort toolkit. The design is inspired with the fact that making energy visible and able to control it will help to conserve energy. One of the key goals is to create a platform which is extendable based on the needs of the end users. Our proposed system is expected to help end users to control and manage residential energy. We also present some lessons learned while implementing and testing the proposed system.
Natural resources plays efficient contribution in the human world in the way of consuming energy resources for the daily life cycle. The main concerns rely on the transporting oil from refining to the consumer usages through different modes. In the transportation passages, its performances are calibrated in the robust manner through sensor network communication and the periodical pigging inspection on the pipeline system. This chapter enumerates about the layout of oil pipeline system and its sensor measurement and instrumentation deliberately placed on the long run pipelines. The evolution of smart grid application enhances this oil transportation in a much corporate band by accumulatively orienting the sensor network in the utilization of power resources. Further, through the wireless communication associated with the smart grid, the pigging inspection gauges are exploited in the desired geographical area with better power consumption. Existing research on communication technologies in SG is briefly overviewed with the main focus on Cloud computing approaches. In this paper, the Smart Grid architecture and its applications are focused on entire oil pipeline from inlet to distribution substations first. The Cloud Computing architecture is explained thoroughly. Then, Cloud Computing for Smart Grid applications are also introduced in terms of efficiency, security and usability. Cloud platforms technical and security protocols are analyzed. Finally, the inspection of oil pipeline system by receiving sensor data of smart pigs incorporated with the cloud computing technique associated with smart grid application is elaborated with its SCADA hierarchical architecture. Further, simulation analysis of wireless sensor nodes with Flexmeter platform for power monitoring over smart pig case scenario is also presented with its layer-wise characterization.
The analysis of links in series aiming at modelling transit paths in telephone networks is presented. Two models based on intuition and systematic considerations are discussed. Their validity is examined by means of simulation for a mesh-structure network operated under various load conditions.
Manufacturing currently faces tremendous potentials with the rapid development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT). As one example, a real-time application for environment monitoring in manufacturing will offer the opportunity to improve its resource and energy efficiency. This requires a structured approach to integrating both WSN and IoT. Although established technology exists, there is a lack of methodology to construct multiple hardware and software platforms and interoperate them effectively. Thus, this paper presents a two-step framework in order to first design a system architecture and then to determine selection criteria for each component. A case study for temperature monitoring is presented for a proof-of-concept.
Electricity consumption is increasing rapidly, and the limited availability of natural resources necessitates efficient energy usage. Predicting and managing electricity costs is challenging, leading to delays in pricing. Smart appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) networks offer a solution by enabling monitoring and control from the broadcaster side. Green IoT, also known as the Green Internet of Things, emerges as a sustainable approach for efficient communication, data management, and device utilization.

This chapter investigates the Network Layer aspects that will characterize the merger of the cellular paradigm and the IoT architectures, in the context of the evolution towards 5G-and-beyond, including some promising emerging services as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Base Stations, and V2X communications.
In this paper, we investigate flooding attack detection and prevention for smart meter networks. The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved.
Z-Wave is a proprietary technology used to integrate sensors and actuators over RF and perform smart home and office automation services. Lacking implementation details, consumers are under-informed on the security aptitude of their installed distributed sensing and actuating systems. While the Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers of the protocol have been made public, details regarding the network layer are not available for analysis. Using a real-world Z-Wave network, the frame forwarding and topology management aspects of the Z-Wave routing protocol are reverse engineered. A security analysis is also performed on the network under study to identify source and data integrity vulnerabilities of the routing protocol. It is discovered that the topology and routes may be modified by an outsider through the exploitation of the blind trust inherent to the routing nodes of the network. A Black Hole attack is conducted on a real-world Z-Wave network to demonstrate a well-known routing attack that exploits the exposed vulnerabilities. As a result of the discoveries, several recommendations are made to enhance the security of the routing protocol.
The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in Internet traffic characterized by variabilities in Quality of Service (QoS) demands. Managing these devices and traffic effectively proves challenging, particularly within conventional IoT network architectures lacking centralized management. However, the advent of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) presents intriguing opportunities for network management, capable of addressing challenges in traditional IoT architectures. SDN's ability to provide centralized network management through a programmable controller, separate from data forwarding elements, has led researchers to incorporate SDN features with IoT (SDIoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSN) ecosystems. However, despite the SDN support, these networks encounter challenges related to load-imbalance routing issues, as the SDN controller may be constrained while certain access points serving end users become overloaded. In response to these challenges, various load-balancing routing solutions have been proposed, each with distinct objectives. However, a comprehensive study that classifies and analyzes these solutions based on their weaknesses and postmortem challenges is currently lacking. This paper fills this gap by providing an in-depth classification of existing solutions. The study categorizes the problems addressed by different schemes and summarizes their findings. Furthermore, it discusses the shortcomings of current studies, and postmortem challenges associated with integrating SDN with IoT, and suggests future research directions.
In this paper, the effect of holding time awareness on the process of time slot assignment in WDM–TDM is considered. Use has been made of Markov model in order to predict the wavelength congestion. A routing algorithm is developed based on the Markov modeling. The results are compared with existing algorithms—ASP, WSP and OTGA. Validation results have shown that the performance of the system is significantly improved in terms of bandwidth blocking ratio, network utilization and fairness.
Proof of Concept of Embedded Solution in Auto-Navigation Destination and Vehicle Collision Avoidance is realization idea which produces evidence that the concept and the feasibility of the auto-navigation and collision avoidance without human drive can be proved and justified. The vehicle will be able to navigate itself automatically to the desired destination. Besides auto-navigation, the two vehicles will also have the capability to avoid collisions with each other using wireless communication via Zigbee. For auto-navigation, the vehicle will move a certain distance forward and calculate its latitude, longitude and its bearing values with relative to the destination point. For the collision avoidance, each vehicle will be equipped with the XBee 802.15.4 transceiver whereby they will transmit and receive their current position and predict whether both of them will collide or not along the way. The experimental results showed that the vehicles are able to auto-navigate to the intended location within a destination position arriving tolerance of ±5m radius range. The Zigbee wireless communication is also successfully implemented and was able to transmit and receive data at long distances (45 m for non-light of sight and 60m for line of sight).
A modern query optimizer typically picks a      query plan for all data based on overall data statistics. However, many have observed that real-life datasets tend to have non-uniform distributions. Selecting a single query plan may result in ineffective query execution for possibly large portions of the actual data. In addition most stream query processing systems, given the volume of data, cannot precisely model the system state much less account for uncertainty due to continuous variations. Such systems select a single query plan based upon imprecise statistics. In this paper, we present “  Query Mesh  ” (or     ), a practical alternative to state-of-the-art data stream processing approaches. The main idea of      is to compute multiple routes (i.e., query plans), each designed for a particular subset of the data with distinct statistical properties. We use terms “plans” and “routes” interchangeably in our work. A      model is induced and used to assign the best route to process incoming tuples based upon their data characteristics. We formulate the      search space and analyze its complexity. Due to the substantial search space, we propose several cost-based query optimization heuristics designed to effectively find nearly optimal     s. We propose the   Self-Routing Fabric      ) infrastructure that supports query execution with multiple plans without physically constructing their topologies nor using a central router like Eddy. We also consider how to support uncertain route specification and execution in QM which can occur when imprecise statistics lead to more than one optimal route for a subset of data. Our experimental results indicate that      consistently provides better query execution performance and incurs negligible overhead compared to the alternative state-of-the-art data stream approaches.           ► Query mesh is a solution between plan-based systems and continuously reoptimizing solutions. ► Our classifier operator employs machine learning and inspects incoming tuples to determine the best routes for each tuple. ► Our Self-Routing Fabric infrastructure execute multiple routes in parallel.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) enables pervasive, ubiquitous, and seamless communication with the physical world. This paper investigates an optimal cross-layer optimization for WSN with periodic application. A joint energy efficient routing with minimum delay scheduling optimization model is proposed in this paper. The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model. The proposed ILP model has multi objectives cost function. The main objective of the proposed model is to maximize network lifetime and to minimize delay. The proposed ILP model represents the operation of Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations. The solution obtained by solving the proposed ILP model is compared with EEDS simulation results. Although the two solutions show similar behavior, the ILP solution outperforms the solution obtained by EEDS simulation by 28.3%. Moreover, the optimal solutions assuming different objectives are compared together.
The paper presents wireless sensor architecture based human fall detection system especially for elderly people. The human fall detection system is implemented using two wireless network architectures, namely cross bow wireless sensor node system and PIC18LF4620 wireless module. The fall detection mechanism is conceived with two sensors including tri-axis accelerometer and Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor which are interfaced to monitor the activity of elderly people. The resultant voltage changes because of human activities are the targeted interest which is detected by both sensors. The real time output is compared with stored templates and the computational analysis is done within microcontroller at site itself. Any abnormality from stored templates is informed to the caretaker through wireless architecture.
Providing Quality of Service (QoS) for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is a taxing task owing to the dynamic topology and limited resources in MANETs. But the need for sustaining real time applications for users of MANET has become very important. This paper makes primary contribution on scheduling algorithms that categorizes and prioritizes the real-time traffic with the intention of improving the performance of the real-time applications. Five types of scheduling algorithms have been analyzed using OPNET simulator. Simulation results shows that Low Latency queuing algorithm improves the overall performance of the real time applications than all other algorithms.
The dominance of dual-setting directional overcurrent relays (DS-DOCRs) based protection schemes and associated high-reliability requirements require rigorous verification of these schemes before deployment. Traditionally, numerical and simulation-based methods are used to analyze the performance of these schemes. However, they are incomplete and, thus, cannot provide complete and accurate analysis results due to their inherent limitations, like round-off errors and sampling-based deductions. Analyzing the impact of each replacement level (replacement of conventional DOCRs by DS-DOCRs) on the protection performance/efficacy of individual network lines is challenging as each deployment level leads to different primary and backup relay protection pairs, which may lead to miscoordination. Also, the random and uncertain nature of faults leads to numerous possible scenarios, which need to be rigorously considered during the analysis. As a more complete and accurate analysis approach, we propose to utilize probabilistic model checking, which is a formal verification technique, for the performance verification of DS-DOCRs-based protection schemes. A formal analysis methodology to determine the optimal deployment of DS-DOCRs. The proposed analysis requires formal models of the behavior of fault, C-DOCRs, and DS-DOCRs-based protection systems, and these models are developed as part of our work. Moreover, we also formalize the quantitative properties to determine the impact of various relay deployment scenarios on the performance of the protection system. For illustration purposes, we use formal models for the quantitative verification of a state-of-the-art DS-DOCRs-based protection scheme for power distribution networks using the probabilistic model checker. This helps us identify the most optimal protection solution for different scenarios.
We introduce SensorDCSP, a naturally distributed benchmark based on a real-world application that arises in the context of networked distributed systems. In order to study the performance of Distributed CSP (DisCSP) algorithms in a truly distributed setting, we use a discrete-event network simulator, which allows us to model the impact of different network traffic conditions on the performance of the algorithms. We consider two complete DisCSP algorithms: asynchronous backtracking (ABT) and asynchronous weak commitment search (AWC), and perform performance comparison for these algorithms on both satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances of SensorDCSP. We found that random delays (due to network traffic or in some cases actively introduced by the agents) combined with a dynamic decentralized restart strategy can improve the performance of DisCSP algorithms. In addition, we introduce GSensorDCSP, a plain-embedded version of SensorDCSP that is closely related to various real-life dynamic tracking systems. We perform both analytical and empirical study of this benchmark domain. In particular, this benchmark allows us to study the attractiveness of solution repairing for solving a sequence of DisCSPs that represent the dynamic tracking of a set of moving objects.
We study the problem of routing and scheduling requests of limited durations in all-optical networks with restrictions on the number of available wavelengths on each link. The task is servicing the requests, assigning each of them a route from source to destination, a starting time and a wavelength with the goal of minimizing the overall time needed to serve all requests. We study the relationship between this problem and minimum path coloring and we show how to exploit known results on path coloring to derive approximation scheduling algorithms for meshes, trees and nearly-Eulerian, uniformly high-diameter graphs. We also propose different approximation algorithms for stars, trees and in trees of rings.
Recently, the adoption of micromobility as an alternative mode of transportation on a large scale has been growing rapidly. However, its operational and safety aspects have not been extensively investigated in the literature. Following this purpose, we developed a novel methodology that aims at evaluating priority areas for shared micromobility system users’ accident risk mitigation based on predicted injury severity using a machine learning-based approach. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of two models: a predictive model, which is based on an artificial neural network with a pattern recognition algorithm, to estimate the expected safety indicator of an urban zone, and a clustering method to define the priority areas for intervention through the application of a geofence speed regulation system. A real case study was carried out in the city of Bari, Italy, to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results showed how it is possible to define areas for intervention with different priorities based on the expected severity index. The proposed methodology can be seen as a decision support system to assist transport operators and urban planners in regulating shared micromobility vehicles in urban areas by defining priority areas for intervention through geofencing and, therefore, it can be useful for improving micromobility adoption, road safety, and urban mobility policies.
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of thousands of tiny nodes having the capability of sensing, computation, and wireless communications. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy consumption is an essential design issues. Since wireless sensor network protocols are application specific, so the focus has been given to the routing protocols that might differ depending on the application and network architecture. The study of various routing protocols for sensor networks presents a classification for the various approaches pursued. The three main categories explored are data-centric, hierarchical and location-based. Each of the routing schemes and algorithms has the common objective of trying to get better throughput and to extend the lifetime of the sensor network.    A comparison has been made between two routing protocols, Flooding and Directed Diffusion, on the basis of throughput and lifetime of the network. Simulation of AODV (WPAN) is also carried over two topologies with same source and destination node.
The rapid growth in internet has led to the emergence of different wireless technologies and simultaneously there has been a tough challenge to provide QoS over such wireless technologies.The demand for various real time multimedia application especially voice and video applications to be available on the internet has also increased. Multimedia applications need a lot more bandwidth and have different QoS requirements than the applications that were used in early years of the internet. The main reason for the poor quality of voice over IP is because we are transmitting the real time applications over the IP network which is mainly meant to transfer only data and not for voice transmission. The purpose of this paper is to check the performance of VOIP application under different CODEC's such as G.711, G.729 and G.723.1 over wireless network with and without silence suppression. Another issue addressed in this paper is the effect of increasing nodes on voice transmission for the different codecs. Parameters like media access delay and throughput are taken into consideration. Simulation is performed using OPNET modeler simulator.
Failures of fiber links can result in major loss of data in high-speed optical communication networks. Survivability is of critical importance, making high levels of availability essential, given the increased level of infrastructure vulnerability to natural disasters, massive power failures, and malicious attacks. A typical approach to the design of resilient optical networks is through protection schemes that predetermine and reserve protection resources based on single and double link-failure scenarios. In this paper we propose a planning heuristic for WDM networks that computes the resource capacity required to transport the traffic demand and protect the optical connections while meeting availability requirements in scenarios of multiple link failures. The method is based on two algorithms, one for path-selection and the other for computing connection unavailability. The numerical results show that the method allows network topology to be exploited to significantly reduce connection unavailability.
The wide availability of the Wi-Fi infrastructure together with the recent integration of the IEEE 802.11mc capability in common-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, have contributed to increasing the interest of the research community in the fine time measurement (FTM) technique, which allows two Wi-Fi devices to estimate distances between each other. However, one of the main issues yet to be solved is how it scales with an increasing number of Wi-Fi devices injecting location-specific traffic in the shared medium. While the recently released IEEE 802.11az standard will still take time before being integrated in COTS devices, this paper aims at assessing the impact of the burst size on the ranging performance of COTS Wi-Fi Android devices running release 12. While increasing the burst size is expected to bring higher stability in the observed distance, on the other hand a longer transmission period for location-only purposes may jeopardize the transmission of data traffic among Wi-Fi users. Several models of smartphones and APs, and different frequency bands, have been considered in order to evaluate the behavior of the FTM procedure in real devices, showing that not always the newest or most expensive ones perform better. Also, it is shown that using the minimum burst size significantly decreases the performance and it is thus not recommended. While bursts longer than 8 may no be always supported by all the models and/or frequency bands, the small improvements in ranging estimations obtained when they are used do not always justify the increased location traffic injected in the network.
One aim of a military tactical network is to Lower the Probability of Detection, LPD, in order to hide the network from a possible adversary. Whilst there are numerous ways that communications can be hidden from an adversary the approach used in this paper is to minimise the transmitted power of the network's radios, whilst keeping the radios connected. Results from previous simulation experiments demonstrated the potential efficacy of these algorithms. In this paper we have implemented these algorithms into mobile radios and performed field trials to determine whether the LPD algorithm would transfer over into a more realistic environment. Problems associated with the noisy wireless medium were overcome and promising results obtained. This paper describes the field trials of the LPD algorithm, discusses some emerging issues, and presents the results from these trials.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet of things (IoT). In such networks, wake-up radio (WuR) is gaining its popularity thanks to its on-demand transmission feature and overwhelming energy consumption superiority. Despite this advantage, overhearing still occurs when a wake-up receiver decodes the address of a wake-up call (WuC) which is not intended to it, causing a certain amount of extra energy waste in the network. Moreover, long latency may occur due to WuC address decoding since WuCs are transmitted at a very low data rate. In this paper, we propose two schemes, i.e., early sleeping (ES) and early data transmission (EDT), to further reduce energy consumption and latency in WuR-enabled IoT/WSNs. The ES scheme decodes and validates an address bit-by-bit, allowing those non-destined devices go to sleep at an earlier stage. The EDT scheme enables a sender to transmit small IoT data together with WuC packets so that the main radio does not have to be in full operation for data reception. We implement both schemes through a WuR testbed. Furthermore, we present a framework based on M/G/1 and assess the performance of the schemes through both theoretical analysis and simulations.
A minimum metric basis is a minimum set      of vertices of a graph                      such that for every pair of vertices             , there exists a vertex              with the condition that the length of a shortest path from          is different from the length of a shortest path from         . The honeycomb and hexagonal networks are popular mesh-derived parallel architectures. Using the duality of these networks we determine minimum metric bases for hexagonal and honeycomb networks.
Energy minimization is one of the significant tasks in the WSN which can be achieved through clustering process. Clustering in the WSN is an efficient method to increase the lifespan of the network. In the proposed work the main concentration is given to the network lifetime which is very necessary for the less node failures and high packet deliveries. In this paper the hierarchical structuring is done using clustering approach based on efficient data aggregation process. The aggregation process is defined into two phases. The first phase defines the arrangement of the nodes in the cluster using uniform distribution and second phase defines the selection of the cluster head and aggregation of the data using linear programming. The main objective is to minimize the energy consumption and increase of the robustness of the sensor network. Eventually the performance of the network will be evaluated in terms of low energy consumption, high packet deliveries and low congestions in the WSN.
The widespread adoption of Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) applications requires the implementation of stringent security mechanisms to minimize the surface of cyber attacks. Authentication is an effective process for validating user identity in vehicular networks. However, authentication alone is not enough to prevent dangerous attack situations. Existing security mechanisms are not able to promptly revoke the credentials of misbehaving vehicles, thus tolerate malicious actors to remain trusted in the system for a long time. The resulting vulnerability window allows the implementation of complex attacks, thus posing a substantial impairment to the security of the vehicular ecosystem. In this paper we propose a Distributed Ledger-based Vehicular Revocation Scheme that improves the state of the art by providing a   vulnerability window   lower than 1 s, reducing well-behaved vehicles exposure to sophisticated and potentially dangerous attacks. The proposed scheme harnesses the advantages of the underlying Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to implement a privacy-aware revocation process while being fully transparent to all participating entities. Furthermore, it meets the critical message processing times defined by EU and US standards, thus closing a critical gap in the current international standards. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, where DLT streamlines the revocation operation overhead and delivers an economically viable yet scalable solution against cyber attacks on vehicular systems.
Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) has recently emerged as an efficient inter-cell interference coordination technique for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multi-tier cellular networks due to its low complexity, minimal signaling over-head, and coverage improvement. In this work, an intermediary region (IR) at the border of the center region (CR) and edge region (ER) is defined, which prevents severe cross-tier interference and is usually ignored by other schemes. Furthermore, a strategic resource allocation scheme is proposed, which allows macro users in this new region to be served more resources due to their good channel conditions close to the serving base station (BS), while femto users are assigned resource blocks from sub-bands that receive the least net interference from a set of usable sub-bands in any region. We find by analysis and simulation the optimal threshold for IR, which minimizes the cross-tier interference, and show that the femto throughput is also maximized for this threshold. Numerical results show the proposed scheme outperforms other notable schemes in terms of throughput and outage performances.
Future networks are expected to support cross-domain, cost-aware and fine-grained services in an efficient and flexible manner. Service Function Chaining (SFC) has been introduced as a promising approach to deliver these services. In the literature, centralized resource orchestration is usually employed to process SFC requests and manage computing and network resources. However, centralized approaches inhibit the scalability and domain autonomy in multi-domain networks. They also neglect location and hardware dependencies of service chains.    In this paper, we propose Distributed Federated Service Chaining (DFSC), a framework for orchestrating and maintaining SFC placement in a distributed fashion while sharing only a minimal amount of domain information and control. First, a deployment cost minimization problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with fine-grained constraints for location and hardware dependencies. We show that this problem is NP-hard. Then, a placement algorithm is devised to use information only on inter-domain paths and border nodes. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that DFSC efficiently optimizes the deployment cost, supports domain autonomy and enables faster decision-making. The results also show that DFSC finds solutions within a factor 1.15 of the optimal solution on average. Compared to a centralized approach in the literature, DFSC reduces the deployment cost by up to 20% and uses 70% less decision-making time.
The manufacturing shop floor exists in a dynamic environment with constantly changing components regarding position and features. Presence tracking on the manufacturing shop floor is essential to enhance effective operations and safety. Internet of Things technology solutions have been developed to track and monitor machine and operators’ movements and materials on the shop floor to enhance machine availability and worker safety and improve overall operational effectiveness. However, for SMMs with limited financial resources and infrastructure, there is a need for a financially friendly approach to shop floor presence tracking and monitoring. This work presents the use of Internet-of-things and physics-based engines to develop a scalable and customizable solution to track presence on a manufacturing floor. The paper aims to improve and promote the adoption of I-4.0 technologies and digital manufacturing by SMMs with the development of an affordable, repeatable, customizable, open-source solution. The article describes a methodology for mapping, modeling, monitoring, and reporting presence on a manufacturing floor using physics-based engines. The methodology describes mapping the manufacturing floor into zones, the design of the IoT solution, selecting and placing sensors, and presenting the data using dashboards and physics-based engines. The paper investigates the methodology by implementing a case study on the Interdisciplinary Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems (ICAMS) manufacturing floor using the Unity3D game engine, open-source software, and off-the-shelf motion sensors.
Building Automation Systems (BASs) are seeing increased usage in modern society due to the plethora of benefits they provide such as automation for climate control, HVAC systems, entry systems, and lighting controls. Many BASs in use are outdated and suffer from numerous vulnerabilities that stem from the design of the underlying BAS protocol. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive, up-to-date survey on BASs and attacks against seven BAS protocols including BACnet, EnOcean, KNX, LonWorks, Modbus, ZigBee, and Z-Wave. Holistic studies of secure BAS protocols are also presented, covering BACnet Secure Connect, KNX Data Secure, KNX/IP Secure, ModBus/TCP Security, EnOcean High Security and Z-Wave Plus. LonWorks and ZigBee do not have security extensions. We point out how these security protocols improve the security of the BAS and what issues remain. A case study is provided which describes a real-world BAS and showcases its vulnerabilities as well as recommendations for improving the security of it. We seek to raise awareness to those in academia and industry as well as highlight open problems within BAS security.
Mobile Ad hoc Network consists of mobile nodes without any assisting infrastructure. Mobility of nodes causes network partition. This leads to heavy overhead and less packet forwarding ratio. In this research work, Residual Energy based Reliable Multicast Routing Protocol (RERMR) is proposed to attain more network lifetime and increased packet delivery and forwarding rate. A multicast backbone is constructed to achieve more stability based on node familiarity and trustable loop. Reliable path criterion is estimated to choose best reliable path among all available paths. Data packets will be forwarded once the reliable path is chosen. We have also demonstrated that residual energy of paths aids to provide maximum network lifetime. Based on the simulation results, the proposed work achieves better performance than previous protocols in terms of packet reliability rate, network stability rate, end to end delay, end to end transmission and communication overhead.
In the domain of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), the quest for ultra-reliable low-latency communication is paramount. Current scheduling strategies, which hinge on strict isolation to ensure low latency and jitter, confront the challenges of high overhead in worst-case latency evaluation and consequent limitations in network flow capacity. This paper introduces an innovative framework that transcends traditional isolation constraints, thereby expanding the solution space and augmenting network schedulability. At the heart of this framework lies a novel latency jitter analysis method that assesses the viability of non-isolation scenarios with constant time complexity. This method underpins a heuristic scheduling algorithm that not only boasts the smallest time complexity among existing heuristics but also significantly increases the number of scheduled flows. Complementing this, we integrate a discrete time reference approach to hasten time-intensive scheduling operations, achieving an optimal balance between schedulability and runtime efficiency. The framework further incorporates a workload-shifting technique to enhance online scheduling responsiveness. It adeptly manages the variability in scheduling times caused by disharmonious flow periods, further bolstering the framework’s robustness. Experimental validations demonstrate that our framework can increase the scheduled flows up to 269%. It reduces scheduling runtime by up to 98.44% for medium-scale networks while maintaining a flat runtime growth curve, ensuring predictable performance in online scheduling scenarios.
Graphical abstract                              In ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, highly selective notch bands are required to avoid interference with other licensed bands. This study presents a highly selective triple-notch UWB-MIMO antenna, which consists of a four-radiating patch antenna and an isolator. The single-element antenna consists of a radiating patch, substrate, ground plane, electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures, and split ring resonators (SRR). To achieve the designated UWB bandwidth, the lower edges of the antenna patch are cut by a quarter-circle radius. The three sharp notches are achieved by utilizing four EBGs and two SRRs at the back of the antenna. The notch bandwidth can also be controlled by changing the parameters such as the width and length of the EBG structure and SRR. The single antenna is then translated into 4-port MIMO systems. The high correlation between elements is reduced by inserting a unique parasitic decoupling structure. The decoupling structure is designed in a way that reduces the mutual coupling in all passbands. The proposed antenna offers a (|S     | < –10 dB) of 3.1 – 11.8 GHz impedance bandwidth. The proposed MIMO antenna having an overall size of 54 × 54 × 1.52 mm3 is fabricated to verify the simulation results. The MIMO antenna shows exceptional diversity properties, including better isolation between unit elements of MIMO antenna (>20 dB), a diversity gain (DG) very close to 10 dB (>9.99 dB), an envelope correlation coefficient which is less than 0.001, and suitable mean effective gain is also in the defined range. The suggested parasitic element UWB – MIMO antenna thus supports its suitability for use in UWB communication networks.

When electrical machines operate without a specific cooling system, the surrounding environment plays a crucial role in the rise of temperature and the duty cycle of operation. More clearly, a natural convection cooling system with a low value of heat transfer coefficient carries the risk of thermal breakdown, insufficient safety, and reliability. This paper studies the heat transfer aspects of a low-power flux switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor under natural convection cooling to implement a novel real-time sensor-less temperature monitoring system. Thermal and electromagnetic experiments are carried out to create foundations for transient and steady-state numerical models. A data-driven, deep learning algorithm estimates the core and permanent magnet (PM) eddy current losses in real-time, besides the already available copper and friction losses. Subsequently, a two-node thermal equivalent circuit in a hybrid model with a feed-forward neural network estimates the dynamic temperature profile of windings and PMs. It is indicated that the worst-case estimation error is below 7.5%, and the configuration is applicable under a wide range of operation states and environmental conditions. Lastly, the system, including the power source, FSPM motor, and hybrid temperature estimation unit, will be implemented in MATLAB/Simulink to investigate the fault prediction and operation management capabilities.
In order to establish an effective platform for individualized product development, the individualized product requirement expression forms were put forward. The diversity Semantic Network of product knowledge representation was researched based on the dualistic semantic network, and the product requirement framework model was established. Thereby the validity, reliability and consistency of the requirement expression process were ensured. Finally an example of customer requirement expression model about differential mechanism based on semantic network was described to satisfy with the individualized product design system.
A routing            of a connected graph            is a collection that contains simple paths connecting every ordered pair of vertices in           . The   edge-forwarding index with respect to             (or simply the forwarding index with respect to                                           is the maximum number of paths in            passing through any edge of           . The   forwarding index                              is the minimum                       over all routings           ’s of           . This parameter has been studied for different graph classes (Xu and Xu, 2012; Bouabdallah and Sotteau, 1993; Fernandez de la Vega and Gordone, 1992; de la Vega and Manoussakis, 1992). Motivated by energy efficiency, we look, for different numbers of edges, at the best spanning graphs of a square grid, namely those with a low forwarding index.
The presence of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles provides an advantage when implementing algorithms that require a ring structure by allowing message traffic to be spread evenly across the network. Edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles also provide the edge-fault tolerant hamiltonicity of an interconnection network. In this paper, we first study the property of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in transposition networks which form a subclass of Cayley graphs. The transposition networks include other famous network topologies as their subgraphs, such as meshes, hypercubes, star graphs, and bubble-sort graphs. We first give a novel decomposition of transposition networks. Using the proposed decomposition, we show that          -dimensional transposition network with               contains four edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. By using the similar approach, we present a linear time algorithm to construct two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles on crossed cubes which is a variation of hypercubes. The proposed approach can be easily applied to construct two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles on the other variations of hypercubes.

Bluetooth (BT) mesh networks are used in several ad hoc network communication scenarios, including natural disasters, calamities, war zones, etc. However, there are situations where Bluetooth mesh networks are misused by anti-social elements during riots etc. As of now there no such research article that showcases detection of BT mesh networks using machine learning tools. Therefore, there is a need to build novel methods for detecting the very presence of Bluetooth mesh networks to aid the law enforcement agencies. This paper contributes to building a new dataset for the aid of machine learning tools to detect the presence of Bluetooth mesh networks. The dataset is extracted from a simulated Bluetooth mesh network with 52 BT network traffic attributes, using the Bridgefy application. Further, the dataset is optimized by identifying prime features, using label encoding, one-hot encoding, correlation analysis and evaluated by various Machine Learning (ML) tools. An accuracy of 99.6% is achieved after optimizing the feature set.
Network services deployment through Software-Defined Networking requires advanced prior configuration of controller databases and devices local system applications. Such prior system definition steps result in rigid infrastructure setup, restricted service deployment scope, and limited reconfiguration flexibility. This paper aims at enabling fast devices configuration and services deployment - within seconds - in dynamic and unconfigured infrastructure contexts.    To address this challenge, we propose NEON, a southbound protocol for dynamic networks, which aims at comprehensive network configuration capability. NEON performs dynamic discovery of devices, thorough live devices interfaces (re)configuration and returns network interface technology specific performance statistics. To evaluate the capacity of NEON to effectively deploy complex protocols, this paper proposes 2 concurrent implementations of PMIPv6 protocol: native and software service. These implementations running on off-the-shelf hardware, showcase the performance of both deployment approaches over unconfigured infrastructure. Our implementation show fast configuration time (a few seconds) when compared to the native deployment (also an original proper implementation). We demonstrate the transparency of the service operation from a user perspective by comparing the performance of both implementations from the edge. NEON is compatible with other configuration and management south- bound protocols such as OpenFlow.
The aim of this work is to present the initial exploration of a behavioural Dynamic Traffic Assignment model, particularly suitable to be used and implemented in agent-based micro-simulations. The proposal relies on the assumption that travellers take routing policies rather than paths, leading us to introduce the possibility for each simulated agent to apply, in real time, a strategy allowing him to possibly re-route his path depending on the perceived local traffic conditions, jam and/or time spent.    The re-routing process allows the agents to directly react to any change in the road network. For the sake of simplicity, the agents’ strategy is modelled with a simple neural network whose parameters are determined during a preliminary training stage. The inputs of such neural network read the local information about the route network and the output gives the action to undertake: stay on the same path or modify it. As the agents use only local information, the overall network topology does not really matter, thus the strategy is able to cope with large networks.    Numerical experiments are performed on various scenarios containing different proportions of trained strategic agents, agents with random strategies and non-strategic agents, to test the robustness and adaptability to new environments and varying network conditions. The methodology is also compared against MATSim and real world data. The outcome of the experiments suggest that this work-in-progress already produces encouraging results.
Free Space Optical (FSO) networks, also known as optical wireless networks, have emerged as viable candidates for broadband wireless communications in the near future. The range of the potential application of FSO networks is extensive, from home to satellite. However, FSO networks have not been popularized because of insufficient availability and reliability. Researchers have focused on the problems in the physical layer in order to exploit the properties of wireless optical channels. However, recent technological developments with successful results make it practical to explore the advantages of the high bandwidth. Some researchers have begun to focus on the problems of network and upper layers in FSO networks. In this survey, we classify prospective global FSO networks into three subnetworks and give an account of them. We also present state-of-the-art research and discuss what kinds of challenges exist.
Numerous cities in developing countries in Asia have focused on building rail transit networks using the transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to improve urban accessibility through public transportation. However, the hypothesis that expanding rail transport networks and implementing TOD policies will improve urban accessibility in developing cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. Therefore, this study selected four Asian cities of various sizes under different stages of development to explore how the expansion of rail transport networks and implementation in high-density development of the three TOD policies affect urban accessibility. The results suggest that rail transit network expansion would significantly increase overall accessibility, and TOD policy implementation would further increase accessibility in all cities. This study clarified that the desired urban structure of each city, which determines accessibility, significantly differs depending on the size of the city and existing and proposed networks.
In this era of modernization, lots of systems have been introduced by which the human effort has been limited to a certain level. In this Paper a data acquisition system has been proposed for factories and industries or environment monitoring, which will measure the certain parameters like temperature, humidity, the level of gases present in atmosphere, motion of any person near the restricted areas at a time and transmit these parameters to the control room wirelessly as well as to the concerned person of the area by the latest smartphone/tablets. Through the smartphone, the person can give command to the control room in case of any parameter crosses a certain level. The data is collected from sensor nodes to the control room node using ZigBee network and then retransmit the desired data to smart phones, tabs and PCs using Bluetooth network. Sensor node contains analog output sensors like temperature, gas and Digital output sensors like sound and metal. The LCD is used to display the sensor parameters. The RF modem is used to transmit the values to the control room node using star and mesh network topologies. The control room node contains ZigBee transceiver module to receive the information and Bluetooth modem to make available the desired data to the smart phones, tabs and PCs. The ZigBee and Bluetooth network are working at 9600 baud rate and 2.4    GHz frequency in ISM band. The ZigBee nodes are capable to transmit the information upto 100meteres and for long distance communication, multi-hopping is used. Bluetooth modem is capable to transmit the information upto 30 feet distance.
The research in the field of Cyber Security has raised the need to address the issue of cybercrimes that have caused the requisition of the intellectual properties such as break down of computer systems, impairment of important data, compromising the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the user. Considering these scenarios, it is essential to secure the computer systems and the user using an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The performance of IDS studied by developing an IDS dataset, consisting of network traffic features to learn the attack patterns. Intrusion detection is a classification problem, wherein various Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques applied to classify the network data into normal and attack traffic. Moreover, the types of network attacks changed over the years, and therefore, there is a need to update the datasets used for evaluating IDS. This paper list the different IDS datasets used for the evaluation of IDS model. The paper presents an overview of the ML and DM techniques used for IDS along with the discussion on CIC-IDS-2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS-2018. These are recent datasets consisting of network attack features and include new attacks categories. This paper discusses the recent advancement in the IDS datasets that can be used by various research communities as the manifesto for using the new IDS datasets for developing efficient and effective ML and DM based IDS.
This research examines the technical feasibility of façades as cyber-physical systems, which can revolutionize former hierarchical and closed automation concepts of mechatronics through their cooperation of decentralized entities. While such systems are already employed in many application fields to increase the flexibility and performance of automated processes, a transfer to the operation of automated adaptive façades has not yet been investigated. In this study, a prototype is developed to systematically test the application of individual cyber-physical system criteria to façades. The prototype is organized in modules, each of which represents one instance of the selected façade functions of solar shading, natural and mechanical ventilation, and heating and cooling. The emphasis lies on development of a communication system that allows the functions to communicate and cooperate with each other. Evaluation of the prototype takes place in five independent case studies, in which the potential of the cyber-physical implementation is demonstrated by a successful system-internal cooperation. The study found that important aspects of cyber-physical systems, like their embedded control, the integration of actuators and sensor networks, implementation of a communication system and connection to a digital twin, are also feasible and promising in the façade domain.

Single modules demonstrate the decentral organisation of façade functions.        Cooperation of façade functions by the use of a MQTT-based communication system.        Connection of the physical prototype to a digital twin for system monitoring.
Telecommunication lattice towers are investigated.        Wind tunnel tests are performed on sectional models equipped with ancillaries.        The presence of ancillaries results in an increase of both drag and lift coefficients.        Drag coefficients resulted much larger than lift coefficients.               Lattice towers are used in several fields such as radio and television broadcasting, wireless communication or mobile networking. These are lightweight structures which are used to support specific equipment to certain heights such as for examples antennas needed for signal transmission. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of ancillary elements on the aerodynamic coefficients of telecommunication lattice towers. To this aim, three wind tunnel tests have been conducted on the sectional model of a real telecommunication tower located in Romania. The leg members have circular cross-sections whereas the diagonal and horizontal members have angle cross-sections. In order to investigate the effect of the cross-section of elements on the aerodynamic coefficients, an additional model having circular cross-sections for the diagonal and horizontal members was considered. The first wind tunnel test was conducted on the bare models, in the second test the models were equipped with a ladder and feeder cables whereas for the third test both the ladder and cables as well as antennas were installed on the models. All tests were performed both in smooth flow as well as turbulent flow.
With over a decade of intensive research and development, wireless sensor network technology has been emerging as a viable solution to many innovative applications. In this paper, we describe a wireless sensor network system that we have developed using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The system is low-cost and highly scalable both in terms of the type of sensors and the number of sensor nodes, which makes it well suited for a wide variety of applications related to environmental monitoring. Overall system architecture and the design of hardware and software components are presented in details in this paper. Some sample deployment and measurement results are also presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.
Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) are widely used in IoT applications as they offer low power consumption and long-range communication. LoRaWAN and SigFox have taken the top positions in the unlicensed ISM bands, while LTE-M and NB-IoT have emerged within cellular networks. We focus on unlicensed bands operation because of their availability for both private and public use with one’s own infrastructure. New technologies have since been developed to overcome limitations of LoRaWAN and SigFox, based on LoRa or other modulation techniques, and are finding their way mainly into the industrial IoT. These include Symphony Link or Ingenu RPMA. To the best of our knowledge, previous works have not been focused on comparing LPWAN technologies in-depth including alternatives to the link and network layers over LoRa other than LoRaWAN. This paper provides a detailed comparative study of these technologies and potential application scenarios. We defend that LoRaWAN is the most suitable for small-scale or public deployments, while Symphony Link provides a robust solution for industrial environments. SigFox is one the most widely deployed networks; and RPMA has the advantage of using the 2.4GHz band, equally regulated in most countries.
To meet the performance and security challenges for users who have the same interests in the urban Peer-to-Peer VANET environment (UP2PVANET), the confidentiality & security scheme applied to the urban P2P VANET network (CSP2P) is introduced which helps maintain an effective certification framework. An intelligent cooperative detection system is also proposed, that uses homomorphic encryption to detect routing attacks. To validate the effectiveness of proposition CSP2P, it is integrated into the implementation of the AODV routing protocol. Simulations results showed the efficiency of the CSP2P scheme in terms of black hole detection, in terms of transmission delay, thanks to the in-depth performance evaluation in the UP2PVANET environment. The obtained results prove that the proposed scheme will allow an increase in system performance of nearly 10% under all load conditions.
Optical grid networks provide an ideal infrastructure to support large-scale data intensive applications and interconnection of data centers. The power consumption of communications equipment for such networks has been increasing steadily over the past decade and energy efficient routing schemes and traffic models can be utilized to reduce the energy consumption. In many applications it is possible to select the destination node from a set of possible destinations, which have the required computing/storage resources. This is known as     . We propose a novel formulation that exploits knowledge of demand holding times and the flexibility of anycast routing to optimally schedule demands (in time) and route them in order to minimize overall network energy consumption. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, compared to traditional routing schemes.
Using archaeobotanical data and examining them with a novel combination of density interpolation surfaces and social and spatial network analyses, this study has brought together exotic food plants in Roman London to outline the changing ‘face’ of its flavourscape, and contextualise it within the broader exotics commerce in Britannia. Consumption of a variety of exotics appeared to be widespread since the very first stages of London's establishment and their presence was maintained throughout although later on, as life in the town developed and its character changed, the focus of their distribution also changed. The emphasis shifted from the core of the city in its early days towards its outer zones, such as the upper Walbrook valley and Southwark in the Middle Roman, and the western and eastern sectors in the Late Roman phase. These changes appeared to largely reflect the changes in the overall commerce network of exotics in     . In this network London starts as a mainly consumption place in the Early Roman phase to become the main redistribution centre in the Middle Roman and the necessary intermediate node in the transport system that had been established by the Late Roman phase, connecting the south to the north.                        The distribution of exotic food plants in Roman London and Britain is modelled.        A combination of density surfaces, social and spatial network analyses is used.        Constant inflow of exotics with variable distribution within London over time.        London changes from consumption to distribution centre after the Early Roman phase.        The established transport network conditioned London's central Late Roman position.

The Internet of Drones (IoD) allows for coordinated control of airspace for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones. The decreasing costs of processors, sensors, and wireless connectivity have made it possible to use UAVs in many variety of military to civilian applications.  While most applications utilizing the drones in the IoD have been real-time related, users are now interested in obtaining real-time services from drones that are tailored to a specific fly zone. This study develops a Sea Turtle Foraging Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection (STFA-HDLID) as a algorithm that recognizes and categorizes intrusions in the IoD environment. For this purpose, it is necessary to implement data pre-processing to standardize the input data via min-max normalization. Additionally, the feature selection process is also based on the STFA. Finally, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with a Sparrow Search Optimization (SSO) algorithm is used for classification. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on a benchmark dataset to demonstrate the performance of the STFA-HDLID, which achieves maximum accuracy of 99.51% and 98.85% on the TON_IoT and UNSW-NB15 datasets, respectively, outperforming other techniques.

As the profundity of open-pit mining operations has increased, so has the frequency of geological disasters. The complex interaction of factors causing these disasters presents technical challenges for early warning and control systems. However, emergent technologies such as the internet, 5G networks, and artificial intelligence provide new opportunities for constructing integrated digital early warning platforms that synthesise multifaceted monitoring data to predict and mitigate open-pit mine hazards. Using efficient Internet-mediated information integration, data from various sources can be consolidated for enhanced disaster management. This paper reviews the current state of digital early warning platforms for open-pit mines using a Web of Science database search for pertinent literature. The framework, data layer, technology layer, and application layer of these platforms are investigated in order to identify associated technologies and obstacles. Important results include: (1) Inconsistent data formats and monitoring software diminish platform workflow efficiency. Robust data exchange protocols and feature-rich software could increase efficiency. (2) Platforms rely on limited data types as opposed to intelligent algorithms that integrate diverse monitoring inputs into global disaster predictions. The underutilization of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and cloud computing. Mining calamity mechanisms and rock mechanics require additional study.                        Summarize the framework of open-pit mine early warning platform.        The incompatibility of application, data and technology in the platform is the main problem.        An early warning platform framework adapted to future trends is proposed.        AI and IOT perception are the trend of future early warning platform.
In this paper, we first introduce a family of interconnection network topologies, named disc-ring graphs. Disc-ring graphs possess many desirable topological properties in building parallel machines, such as fixed degree, small diameter, Hamiltonian decomposition, etc. We first examine the topological properties of disc-ring graphs and give an efficient routing algorithm for disc-ring graphs. We then bring forward a novel interconnection network of DQcube, which is a compound graph of disc-ring graph and hypercube. That is, it uses the hypercube as a unit cluster and connects many such clusters by means of a disc-ring graph at the cost that only one additional link is added to any node in each hypercube. The topological benefits of both basic graphs are preserved in the compound network. It utilizes the topological properties of hypercube to conveniently embed parallel algorithms into each cluster and the short diameter of disc-ring graph to support an efficient inter-cluster communication. The proposed methodologies for DQcube are further applied to many other compound graphs of disc-ring graph and hypercube-like graphs, including locally twisted cube, twisted cube, crossed cube, and Möbius cube, with diameter being a half of that of hypercube. We also give and analyze an efficient routing algorithm for the proposed compound networks in this article.
The incorporation of end devices in the edge-to-cloud continuum yields substantial benefits to conventional cloud computing frameworks, expediting communication between end devices and computational resources, and resulting in new use cases, particularly in the field of mobile networks. However, few related works leverage the full potential of resource sharing at the far edge, as most proposals require that end nodes rely on a higher-capacity computational node.    This manuscript presents Multi-Hop Wireless Resource Sharing Protocol (MuHoW), a lightweight protocol tailored for multi-hop wireless networks. MuHoW enables resource sharing within collaborative edge-computing networks by facilitating the discovery of wireless neighbours and subsequently establishing a confluence tree directed towards the edge/fog infrastructure. This tree serves as a conduit for aggregating essential resource sharing information, ensuring the establishment of a seamless collaborative edge/fog environment. The empirical findings highlight the scalability of MuHoW, due to its linear control message growth with network size. Moreover, the efficiency of the protocol is very high even in lossy environments as evidenced by the fact that most resource sharing messages are successfully delivered as expected.
The Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is a newly developed wireless network which supports broadband and high speed multimedia service, so the Quality-of-Service (QoS) must be guaranteed by the network. In this paper, a new QoS-aware routing protocol based on AODV named QAODV (QoS- AODV) is proposed. Under the premise of the delay and available bandwidth meeting the QoS demands, the protocol defines a new route metric with the hop count and load rate so as to select the best route according to it. Simulation results show that, compared with AODV, the performance of QAODV is better on both network throughput and end-to-end delay with small increase of control overhead. As a whole, the protocol improves the QoS guarantee capability in the WMN.
The rapid adoption of Industry 4.0 has seen Information Technology (IT) networks increasingly merged with Operational Technology (OT) networks, which have traditionally been isolated on air-gapped and fully trusted networks. This increased attack surface has resulted in compromises of Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) with significant economic and life safety consequences. This paper proposes a hybrid model of anomaly detection of security threats to CPS by blending the signature-based and threshold-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) commonly used in IT networks, with a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to detect behaviour-based anomalies in OT networks. This hybrid model achieves more rapid detection of known threats through signature-based and threshold-based detection strategies, and more accurate detection of unknown threats via behaviour-based anomaly detection using ML algorithms.                       Anomaly detection in Cyber–Physical Systems.        Internet of Things (IoT) Security.        One-class machine learning.
While the spreading of the Internet of Things continues beyond expectations, the security of networking technologies used in this context remains an open issue. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art on the security of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), with a focus on Sigfox, LoRaWAN, and Narrowband Internet of Things.

Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communications has attracted much research attention. However, most applications of UAVs for wireless communication provisioning are not feasible as researchers fail to consider some vital aspects of their deployment, especially the energy requirements of both the UAV and communication system. The considerable energy consumption overhead involved in flying or hovering UAVs makes them less appealing for green wireless communications. Therefore, in this work, we examine the feasibility of an alternative energy-efficient deployment scheme where UAVs can be made to land-on designated locations, also known as landing stations (LSs). The idea of LS makes the UAV-based wireless communication more durable and advantageous, since the total energy consumption is reduced by minimizing the flying/hovering energy consumption, which, in turn, enables diverse set of applications including emergency and pop-up networking. We evaluate the impact of the separation distance between these LSs and the Optimal Hovering Position (OHP) on the network performance. Specifically, we develop mathematical frameworks to model the relationship between UAV power consumption, coverage probability, throughput, and separation distance. Numerical results reveal that a significant energy reduction can be achieved when the LS concept is exploited with a slight compromise in coverage probability and throughput. However, the choice of a suitable LS location depends on the users’ service requirements, transmit power, and frequency band utilized.
This study responds to global climate concerns by addressing the shift towards sustainable transportation, particularly electric vehicles. Focusing on wireless power transfer to overcome charging infrastructure challenges, the research optimizes circular coils for inductive power transfer in electric cars. Utilizing ferrite cores to enhance performance, the study employs ANSYS Electronics Suite R2-202 and the finite element method to analyze circular coils, exploring variations in turns, inner radius, air gap, and misalignment's impact on the coupling coefficient. Introducing ferrite plan cores and boxes, the research finds that ferrite boxes improve coupling efficiency by 50% and electromagnetic field strength by 300%, concentrating the field toward the center. An inequivalent design, enlarging the primary coil, demonstrates significant enhancements, achieving a coupling coefficient increase of 0.183447 and an electromagnetic field rise of 0.00040 Tesla. Equivalent coils with ferrite boxes meet a 95% efficiency goal with a strong, narrowed field at a lower cost, while inequivalent coils excel in strengthening and centralizing the field, enhancing misalignment tolerance in distinctive ways.       Graphical abstract             Image 1                               The research focuses on wireless power transfer to overcome electric vehicle charging infrastructure challenges.

Equivalent coils with ferrite boxes achieve a 95% efficiency goal, providing a cost-effective solution.
The aim of this contribution is a new study on the achievement, fabrication and the test of a new low pass filter (LPF) coplanar structure based on periodic resonators. The proposed structure can be easly integrated with microwave devices, the validated LPF circuit has a wide band pass and high band stop. The design was done by two electromagnetic (EM) solvers one is based on moment method and the other one on finite integration technique. In order to reach a final LPF structure with good characteristics concerning the insertion loss of       0.8 dB and high attenuation until 15 GHz, the cut-off frequency of this filter is equal to 6,77 GHz. Many series of optimization were conducted using multiple algorithms. The whole area of the validated LPF is
Network virtualization can effectively establish dedicated virtual networks to implement various network functions. However, the existing research works have some shortcomings, for example, although computing resource properties of individual nodes are considered, node storage properties and the network topology properties are usually ignored in Virtual Network (VN) modelling, which leads to the inaccurate measurement of node availability and priority. In addition, most static virtual network mapping methods allocate fixed resources to users during the entire life cycle, and the users’ actual resource requirements vary with the workload, which results in resource allocation redundancy. Based on the above analysis, in this paper, we propose a dynamic resource sharing virtual network mapping algorithm named NMA-PRS-VNE, first, we construct a new, more realistic network framework in which the properties of nodes include computing resources, storage resources and topology properties. In the node mapping process, three properties of the node are used to measure its mapping ability. Second, we consider the resources of adjacent nodes and links instead of the traditional method of measuring the availability and priority of nodes by considering only the resource properties, so as to more accurately select the physical mapping nodes that meet the constraints and conditions and improve the success rate of subsequent link mapping. Finally, we divide the resource requirements of Virtual Network Requests (VNRs) into basic sub-requirements and variable sub-variable requirements to complete dynamic resource allocation. The former represents monopolizing resource requirements by the VNRs, while the latter represents shared resources by many VNRs with the probability of occupying resources, where we keep a balance between resource sharing and collision among users by calculating the collision probability. Simulation results show that the proposed NMA-PRS-VNE can increase the average acceptance rate and network revenue by 15% and 38%, and reduce the network cost and link pressure by 25% and 17%.
Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET) is one of the recently growing trends which motivate the provision of several service providers in the urban areas. In VANETs, the vehicles represent the nodes in the network topology that needs to guarantee better cooperation when there is a higher node density. Moreover, the problem of determining an optimal route and achieving network scalability is a herculean task. In this context, the incorporation of a potential clustering algorithm has the possibility of improving the road safety and facilitating a reliable option of promoting message routing. The clustering protocols are determined to be the ideal candidate for solving the problems of network scalability to guarantee reliable data dissemination. In this paper, Remora optimization algorithm-based Optimized Node Clustering (ROAONC) Technique is proposed for node clustering in VANETs to achieved optimal CH selection process. This ROAONC scheme was proposed for minimizing network overhead in the scenarios of unpredictable node density. The simulation results of this ROAONC scheme confirmed better performance in terms of transmission range, node density, network area and number of clusters compared to the competitive ant colony, grey wolf, grasshopper, and dragonfly optimization algorithm-based clustering protocols.                        Remora Optimization Algorithm-based Optimized Node Clustering Technique.        Reliable Data Delivery in VANETs.        Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET).

Dust particles and sand storms can cause attenuation and cross-polarization of electromagnetic wave propagation, especially at high frequencies above 10 GHz. Dust attenuation has been the focus of many research works, mainly with the deployment of a 5G wireless network in the FR-2 band (mmWave band, 23–53 GHz with TDD). This has led to the development of novel models to accurately predict and estimate attenuation. However, the existing review works have not adequately provided extensive taxonomies for these models to show the state-of-art and future research directions. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive review of all electromagnetic scattering models in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and applications. Lessons learned from the detailed survey have been stated and discussed extensively. Key findings from this review indicate that all the models developed were limited to the region where they were developed, with frequency and visibility levels as the two main parameters. The survey across regions showed no model was developed for Region 2, including the Americas, Greenland, and some of the eastern Pacific Islands. Among the dry regions of the globe, where dust and sand storms can occur either occasionally or frequently, it can be seen that only a few parts of these desert regions of Africa (Region 1) and Asia (Region 3) have been considered by authors for the development of prediction models for attenuation due to dust storms. Thus, this also shows the limitations of the overall deterministic models and presents the crucial need to develop new models or modify existing models to accurately predict dust attenuation in other regions, particularly in Africa.
The smart car collects the signal through the infrared sensor, and obtains the gray map in front of the car, according to the gray map, the tracking is judged.Due to the complexity of the environment, many gray-scale maps are difficult to trace, and even cannot be judged, which brings great uncertainty to the operation of the smart car.The paper designs a method to improve the infrared tracking accuracy of smart cars.First, determine the level of contrast in this graph.By improving the brightness in the grayscale image, the gray signal around the tracking line is eliminated, and then the tracking line is highlighted by increasing the contrast.Therefore, it effectively overcomes the shortcomings of poor practicality of smart cars and improves the infrared tracking accuracy of smart cars.
To overcome a frequent occurrence of routing loops due to communication link failure and to provide an ensured packet delivery among the Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET), an Optimized Node Selection Routing Protocol (ONSRP) of VANET has been implemented using a Trust Computing Algorithm. Basically, the time efficiency indicates how fast the algorithm runs. In this paper, the Trust Computing algorithm has been analyzed mathematically to find the time complexity of the algorithm currently chosen and hence achieved trusted communication and high packet delivery ratio of data transmission among the Vehicular Adhoc Networks. We could confirm that the ONSRP is optimal by comparing it to the Scalable Hybrid Routing (SHR) communication overhead and packet delivery ratio of the network from both analysis and simulation in the presence of link failures.
Road network is considered to be one of the keys to regional development of a region. The huge developmental cost of the road network demands effective utilisation, which can be attained only when there is proper connectivity and orientation. But the road network in many urban areas develop in an organic growth pattern. Hence a great emphasis needs to be given to the connectivity pattern of the road network. Urban road network has less theoretical research. Only some developed countries have carried out the evaluation of urban road network and hence it has great potential for development and application prospects.    In this study an attempt has been made to analyse the road network connectivity and spatial pattern existing in Calicut city in India, and hence to determine if the network connectivity can explain significant variance in the spatial pattern of the network structure. Analysis reveals that transport network fractality is directly varying with respect to connectivity and coverage of the study area. Network density could better predict fractality of the road network than any other connectivity indicators. This means that there is significant relationship between the level of road network development and the network spatial structure within the study area.
Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) play a vital role in modern communication systems, and optimizing the placement of wireless mesh routers is crucial for achieving efficient network performance in terms of coverage and connectivity. However, network congestion caused by overlapping routers poses challenges in WMN optimization. To address these issues, researchers have explored metaheuristic algorithms to strike a balance between coverage and connectivity in WMNs. This study introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, namely Transient Trigonometric Harris Hawks Optimizer (TTHHO), specifically designed to tackle the optimization problems in WMNs. The primary objective of TTHHO is to find an optimal placement of routers that maximizes network coverage and ensures full connectivity among mesh routers. Notably, TTHHO's unique advantage lies in its efficient utilization of residual energy, strategically placing the sink node in areas with higher energy levels. The effectiveness of TTHHO is demonstrated through a comprehensive comparison with seven well-known algorithms, including Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Transient Search Optimizer (TSO). The proposed algorithm is rigorously validated using 33 benchmark functions, and statistical analyses and simulation results confirm its superiority over other algorithms in terms of network connectivity, coverage, congestion reduction, and convergence. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed TTHHO algorithm in optimizing WMNs, making it a promising approach for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems.
Explosive growth in the field of Information and Communication Technology demands an access technology which can serve users better Internet speed in "anytime anywhere” manner. Fiber Wireless (FiWi) access technology is one of the existing technologies that fulfills the current demands of users in cost-efficient manner. Some of the important issues of the FiWi network are ONU placement and energy saving. ONU placement issue affects the deployment cost and network performance while energy saving is the need for green technology. On taking consideration of these two issues we propose a whale optimization algorithm for ONU placement for FiWi network. The proposed algorithm optimizes the position of ONUs in such a manner that all deployed wireless routers can connect to their primary ONUs with minimum possible average communication distance. Simulation is performed for varying number of wireless routers to check the worthiness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the average communication distance between ONU and its associated wireless routers hence, it may offer the best way to deploy energy efficient FiWi network.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely used in various industries for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, plays a central role in the IoT architecture. However, despite its widespread adoption, an analysis conducted on the shodan search engine revealed up to 540531 vulnerabilities worldwide as of April 2024, underscoring the security challenges facing this protocol. How can an innovative cyber range system be designed to assess and improve the security of MQTT protocols, focusing on in-depth vulnerability analysis, authentication strategy development, and targeted countermeasures against specific attacks? The study includes an analysis of relevant articles, followed by classification into five different categories. Furthermore, the presentation of a cyber range that exposes various attacks, such as replay attacks, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), Denial of Service (DoS)/Distributed DoS(DDoS), and cam-hackers, enhances the understanding of MQTT protocol vulnerabilities, emphasizes the critical importance of strengthening security, and serves as a reference for new researchers in the field.
information refers to information whose ‘most recent’ or ‘latest’ instance is most valuable. In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), multiple instances of a piece of timely information may be produced by different nodes at different points in time. The problem is to discover the ‘latest’ instance among all existing instances. Within the context of MANETs, timely information discovery is fundamentally different from the existing resource/service discovery problem whose goal is to discover either      instance or a      of instances which satisfy a      query constraint that can be specified and evaluated using only local attributes of each individual node. In contrast, the timely information discovery problem imposes the      (timeliness) constraint which should best be evaluated when      the instances are considered to determine the latest instance. The complication of discovering timely information arises from the existence of multiple instances of the information, which are produced at different points in time by different nodes in the network, and the need to collect all these instances to decide the latest instance. For MANETs, the lack of infrastructure supports, frequent topology changes, and potential packet loss in wireless communications further challenge the problem of timely information discovery. This paper describes a self-organizing, peer-to-peer based approach, termed ALADIN, to discovering timely information in MANETs. In ALADIN, nodes that produce instances of the timely information are peers who self-organize an adaptive and distributed ‘search infrastructure’ to facilitate the discovery of the latest instance. A simulation study shows that ALADIN is scalable without incurring network-wide flooding in the case of large-scale networks and popular timely information, and yields a high chance of discovering the latest instance in the presence of mobility.
Long and heavy cables need to be laid during the construction of plant. The present-day cable installation system drives the cables through by power assistance in order to reduce physical stress on the workers. However, the system cannot pull a long and heavy cable sequentially at the desired timing of the tension triggered onto the cable head by the worker. To solve this problem, we propose a multihop wireless controlled system that works to push the cable at a time set by instruction packets delivered according to the applied tension. This paper explains the design and adoption of a multihop wireless controlled sensor and actuator network into the cable installation system.
Although several analytical models have been proposed in the literature for binary     -cubes with deterministic routing, most of them have not included the effects of virtual channel multiplexing on network performance. The only mathematical model for deterministic wormhole routing in hypercubes with virtual channels was proposed in [Y. Boura, Design and Analysis of Routing Schemes and Routers for Wormhole-routed Mesh Architectures, Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, 1995] which uses complex combinatorial analysis with a computation time of O(          ) for an     -dimensional hypercube. This paper proposes a new and simple analytical model to compute message latency in binary     -cubes with virtual channels. It is very simple and easy to understand which uses an average case analysis and requires a computation time of O(    ) for an     -dimensional hypercube. Results from simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various network sizes and under different operating conditions.
In this work we consider deterministic oblivious          routing algorithms with buffer size                  . We present an asymptotically optimal                            step oblivious          routing algorithm for                      meshes of               processors for all                         . We further show how the algorithm can be used to achieve asymptotically optimal oblivious          routing algorithms on other networks.
The maturity of wireless technologies and the growing popularity of sensor technology in our daily life have created fascinating possibilities in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). One of the most critical fields of WSN is how effective is the data collection model in such a network. The goal is to ensure data collection consistency and reliability while attempting to conserve the power consumption within the network. We are proposing a balanced data collection model that can be setup on random or controlled WSN deployment that can meet different levels of reliability requirements while balancing power consumption across the network. The proposed model utilizes an optimization heuristic to achieve a set of system-defined goals.
Matter is an open-source, royalty-free connectivity standard developed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA-IoT). It aims to unify smart home devices and increase their compatibility across various ecosystems. Backed by major tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and the Zigbee Alliance, Matter simplifies the development of IoT devices by providing a unified approach to connectivity. It offers a secure, reliable, and seamless way for devices to communicate and interact, regardless of the manufacturer.

It describes the main characteristics of Matter in its Specification 1.0 state, reviewing the features and functionalities of the Matter protocol, as well as the opportunities for its use and the challenges for its large-scale adoption in Matter-compliant IoT devices.    We discuss the impact of Matter on IoT technologies and ecosystems, providing guidance for manufacturers and consumers. We analyze the emerging research challenges in its adoption and propose our recommendations on how to improve and extend this protocol for better use in the future.
Recent advances in sensing modules and radio technology will enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. They collect data from different environment or infrastructures in order to send them to the cloud using different communications platforms. These data can be used to provide smarter services. However, they are various issues and challenges related to the ubiquitous sensors that should be solved. In this paper we interest on analysis of wireless sensor network from an energy management perspective. The idea behind the energy-efficiency wireless sensor networks is that each node can only transmit to a limited number of other nodes directly. The limited resources of nodes imply that the transmission range is limited. In order to transfer the data to the final destination, the traffic must be relayed using intermediate nodes, creating a multi-hop route. The total energy consumption associated with an end-to-end transmission over such a route can be significantly reduced if the nodes are correctly configured. In this paper, underground mine monitoring system is presented with an overview of the related issues and challenges such as reliability, cost, and scalability.
Recent advancements in communication technologies and embedded system design have popularized the practical application of cyber–physical systems (CPS).

This paper suggests the naming for Internet of Things (IoT) devices where a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is assigned to each device instead of the IP address. This naming method enables the user equipments (UEs) to reach IoT devices easily. Nowadays, one of the main challenges in IoT is the discovery scheme. This paper explores the discovery scheme that can operate under the current DNS and its legacy Resource Record (RR) format. The IoT device with the group name of     , the domain of      and the device name of     77 can be discovered by means of the URL:     . This paper explores how the UE behind the Network Address Translation (NAT) device discovers the destination IoT devices and establishes IoT Device-to-User Equipment (D2U) data session under the condition that IoT access networks tend to be constraint networks. Here, the discovery and session establishment processes are controlled by the software-defined control plane controller.
The paper presents the concept of determining the flight trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm that forms a flying ad-hoc network (FANET) for communication with each other. The FANET allows the swarm to follow a predetermined route between the starting and ending areas performing the reconnaissance task of the most significant area during the flight. The primary limitations of the FANET, which is used by the UAV swarm, are discussed. The radio link range between FANET nodes is based on a power budget and various propagation models. Whereas, for determining the UAV flight trajectories, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm based on the modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). This modification of the base RRT algorithm allows for planning the flight of several UAVs with meeting indicated restrictions, e.g., the minimum distance between individual UAVs ensuring communication between them at any time of the flight. Simulation tests are carried out for a swarm composed of several UAVs in environments with a random number of obstacles, corresponding to a real scenario for search and rescue operations.
We study the High Throughput Modulation and Coding Schemes (HT-MCS) in IEEE 802.11n In networks in this paper. The HT-MCSs are designed to deal with various channel conditions in the networks. We used ns-3 simulations to study HT-MCS 0 to HT-MCS 31 under various radio propagation models. The simulation results are presented in this paper. In our simulations the HT-MCSs were tested in networks with Friis, Nakagami, and log-distance propagation models for studying their performance under various signal attenuation and fading effects. The HT-MCSs provided consistent performance under most channel conditions in our simulations. However, they showed significantly degraded performance under the log-distance propagation model when the communication distance was relatively long because of the high signal attenuation in such a case. Our simulations also showed that an increased number of radio beams increased the ability of the modulation and coding schemes in combating adverse channel conditions.
A wireless sensor network is a set of nodes, each is equipped with a sensing device and a wireless communication device. Because centralized control is hard to achieve in a large scale sensor network, self-          is a key concept in the design of a wireless sensor network. Self-stabilization is one of the self-          properties, and it is one of the most promising theoretical backgrounds for self-organizing wireless sensor network protocols. Herman [T. Herman, Models of self-stabilization and sensor networks, in: Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop of Distributed Computing, IWDC, 2003, pp. 205–214] proposed Cached Sensornet Transform (CST for short) for design and implementation of self-stabilizing algorithms for sensor networks. It transforms a self-stabilizing algorithm in a high-level computational model to a program for sensor networks. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. We show that there exists a non-silent algorithm that behaves correctly in a high-level computational model but its transformed version by CST does not behave correctly if packets are lost. We show a sufficient condition for original algorithms and networks such that the algorithm transformed by CST behaves correctly. As a case study, we present a token circulation algorithm that behaves correctly by CST and derive the upper bound of its expected convergence time.
As rail transit continues to develop, expanding railway networks increase the demand for sustainable energy supply and intelligent infrastructure management. In recent years, advanced rail self-powered technology has rapidly progressed toward artificial intelligence and the internet of things (AIoT). This review primarily discusses the self-powered and self-sensing systems in rail transit, analyzing their current characteristics and innovative potentials in different scenarios. Based on this analysis, we further explore an IoT framework supported by sustainable self-powered sensing systems including device nodes, network communication, and platform deployment. Additionally, technologies about cloud computing and edge computing deployed in railway IoT enable more effective utilization. The deployed intelligent algorithms such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can provide comprehensive monitoring, management, and maintenance in railway environments. Furthermore, this study explores research in other cross-disciplinary fields to investigate the potential of emerging technologies and analyze the trends for future development in rail transit.

In this paper, the effect of time difference of arrival (TDoA) is investigated for distributed nodes in OFDMA-based wireless mesh networks (WMNs). In order to minimize the interferences caused by TDoA in WMNs, the optimal starting point of FFT window at the receiver side of a node is derived by maximizing the effective SINR for each subcarrier. Also, a signal detection technique, called two dimensional ordered successive interference cancellation (TD-OSIC), is proposed for WMNs with TDoAs. It was shown via simulation that the proposed technique can achieve effective SINR and BER performances similar to the ideal case (no TDoA), even in WMNs with large TDoAs.
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have gained much attention in recent years, however, these networks suffer from limited energy supply and noisy wireless links. Thus, efficient energy management and noise handling are key requirements in designing WSNs. This paper proposes an interference-aware and energy-aware routing algorithm such that power dissipation is uniform among all sensors. The proposed algorithm utilizes time synchronization and traffic scheduling to avoid interference. This work mathematically models the problem as node clustering optimization. Simulation results show the optimized proportions of packets sent by nodes to ensure uniform energy dissipation, as well as, reduced interference within clusters.

Bandwidth is a very valuable resource in wavelength division multiplexed optical networks. The problem of finding an optimal assignment of wavelengths to requests is of fundamental importance in bandwidth utilization. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem on fixed constant-size topologies. We combine this algorithm with ideas from Raghavan and Upfal (1994) to obtain an optimal assignment of wavelengths on constant degree undirected trees. Mihail, Kaklamanis, and Rao (1995) posed the following open question: what is the complexity of this problem on directed trees? We show that it is NP-complete both on binary and constant depth directed trees.
The emergence of new devices and technologies introduces new trends and design issues for optical transport networks. The higher performance of transmission and switch systems enables the reduction of optoelectronic conversions in intermediate nodes with the introduction of transparency in the network. Simultaneously, the system of Automatic Switched Optical Networks (ASON) describes the rules for the construction of a network enabling cost reduction, above all for maintenance, and fast and automatic reconfiguration. Two axes have to evolve to make possible all these proprieties: the control plane and its relative set of protocols, to manage the network working for the network automation, and also the systems and tools enabling transparency and reconfigurability. In this article we focus on the second axis applied to an automatic transparent network.    To cite this article: A. Morea et al., C. R. Physique 9 (2008).            L'apparition de nouveaux dispositifs et de nouvelles technologies permet d'envisager de façon nouvelle la conception des réseaux de transport optiques. L'amélioration des performances des systèmes de transmission et de commutation a permis de s'affranchir de conversions optoélectronique dans les nœuds intermédiaires et a ainsi rendu possible l'introduction de la transparence dans les réseaux. En parallèle, le concept de Réseaux Optiques à Commutation Automatique (Automatic Switched Optical Networks (ASON)) définit les règles de fonctionnement d'un réseau favorisant la réduction des coûts, principalement les coûts de maintenance, une plus grande disponibilité, ainsi qu'une reconfiguration plus rapide et automatique du réseau. Pour mettre en œuvre ces propriétés, deux axes de recherche sont envisagés : le plan de contrôle et ses différents protocoles dédiés à la gestion du réseau pour le rendre automatique comme les systèmes et les outils apportant transparence et reconfigurabilité. Dans cet article, nous analysons ce second axe appliqué à un réseau transparent automatique.    Pour citer cet article : A. Morea et al., C. R. Physique 9 (2008).
Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks are special case of ad hoc networks that, besides lacking infrastructure, communicating entities move with various accelerations. Accordingly, this impedes establishing reliable end-to-end communication paths and having efficient data transfer. Thus, VANETs have different network concerns and security challenges to get the availability of ubiquitous connectivity, secure communications, and reputation management systems which affect the trust in cooperation and negotiation between mobile networking entities. In this survey, we discuss the security features, challenges, and attacks of VANETs, and we classify the security attacks of VANETs due to the different network layers.
This paper investigates an optimal cross-layer joint routing and scheduling problem for WSN with periodic data collection. The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model such that a joint scheduling and routing is developed to maximize network lifetime. An ILP model for Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol is proposed. The main objective of the ILP model is to build an energy efficient joint routing tree and TDMA scheduling framework considering the EEDS assumptions. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations. The results obtained by the ILP model are compared with the EEDS protocol simulation results.
In this paper, we consider the many-to-one packet routing problem on the mesh parallel architecture. This problem has not been considered before. It models the communication pattern that occurs when many processors try to write on the same memory location on a concurrent-read concurrent-write shared memory parallel machine. We show that there is an instance of the many-to-one packet routing problem that requires         /2 routing steps to be solved, where      is the maximum number of packets a processor can receive. We give an algorithm that solves the problem in asymptotically optimal time. Furthermore, our algorithm uses queues of small constant size. This queue bound is very important since the ability to expand the mesh is preserved. Finally, we consider two variations of the many-to-one packet routing problem, namely, the case where      is not known in advance, and the case where combining the packets that are destined for the same processor is allowed.
Since the 1990s, there has been a noticeable increase in the establishment of local district heating networks in Germany, coinciding with the use of thermal energy from biogas and biomass facilities. Historically, the prioritization of economically efficient heat utilization was subdued due to favorable electricity feed-in tariffs. However, with the expiration of Renewable Energy Sources Act subsidies, operators shifted focus to the operational costs of district heating networks. This study aims to examine the effects of optimizing controllers and valves at district heating substations in single-family homes, utilizing two local district heating networks. The emphasis is on evaluating impacts on operating costs and determining whether the economic and energetic benefits justify implementation. Simulation studies in MATLAB/Simulink Simscape depict both consumers and district heating networks individually, without aggregation. In the most favorable scenario, investing in enhancing substation controllers in single-family homes is projected to yield returns after 13 years. Comprehensive optimization of all substation controls in single-family homes can potentially result in up to 9 % savings in thermal energy demand due to reduced heat losses and a corresponding 9 % reduction in electrical power consumption for the main pump.                        Self-operated substations were upgraded with digital controllers.        The investigation was conducted on two typical demonstration cases.        A physical model of the DHN without aggregation of consumers was developed.        All critical models were validated using measurement data.
Modern mobile handheld devices, such as smartphones and tablets, feature multiple wireless interfaces, some of which can support device-to-device communications, which enable mesh networks on even when the infrastructure is unavailable. One of the key technological challenges hampering the use of multi-hop mesh networks is the extremely high communication overhead of route discovery and maintenance algorithms. The problem is especially pronounced under dynamic network conditions caused by user mobility and nodes joining and leaving the network. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed algorithm for constructing a virtual coordinate system used for geo-like routing by approximating the physical network nodes coordinate. The proposed algorithm, called gradient assisted routing (GAR), builds upon two-hop neighbors’ information exchanged in beacons in contrast to conventional geographic routing protocols which rely on external positioning information. We evaluate the proposed solution using algorithmic, topological, and routing-related metrics of interest. We further numerically quantify how the node mobility increases the time needed for topology stabilization, and how network size affects the route discovery success rate. Our comparison also shows that for small to mid-size mesh networks (up to 60 nodes), the performance of the proposed routing procedure is similar to the conventional geographic routing protocols that exploit external positioning information. The proposed solution may efficiently supplement the traditional on-demand routing in small to mid-size mesh systems by independently establishing 50 to 70% of paths and thereby reducing the discovery overheads.
The electrification of heating, and in particular district heating networks, is challenging from system integration and cost perspectives but could provide significant services for the wider electricity system. In this work, several control strategies are compared for the optimal design of a high-temperature, power-constrained electrified district heating network of a university campus with borehole thermal energy storage and grid services such as flexibility, load-levelling and wind curtailment mitigation. The proposed heat plant operation is modelled in TRNSYS and its performance is analysed from a grid operator and end-user’s viewpoint. The impact of several system parameters is investigated in a sensitivity analysis.    It is shown that, depending on the control strategy, total efficiencies up to 200 % and curtailed wind fractions up to 43.8 % are achievable with great flexibility and load-levelling, and operating costs and emissions significantly lower than for gas-reliant systems. A control strategy which aims for load-levelling and maximal storage headroom is shown to be best suited from the perspective of both the end-user (efficiency, emissions and cost) and grid operator (grid services). A compromise between efficiency and grid services is highlighted which could be mitigated by financial incentives for curtailed wind integration, benefiting both consumers and grid operators.
Wireless Wireless network finds application in military environments, emergency, rescue operations and medical monitoring due to its self-configuring nature. As the availability of resources such as processing power, buffer capacity and energy are limited in wireless networks; it is required to devise efficient algorithms for packet forwarding. Due to the dynamic nature of the wireless environment, the traditional packet forwarding strategies cannot guarantee good network performance every time. This paper proposes a method for learning data flow rates in wireless network to improve quality of service in the network. Each node in the network learns the environment using reinforcement learning approach and selects appropriate neighbours for packet forwarding. In order to improve the learning capacity of nodes, the hierarchical docition technique is employed. Docition applied to each layer of network, which selects a set of special nodes which has more information about the environment and share this information with less informative nodes. The algorithm is tested in a geographical routing protocol and the results indicate improved network performance.
In the ambient information society, embedded sensors detect and conjecture environmental and personal conditions. Then, actuators provide users with information services and environmental controls which are suited for time, place, occasion, and people. Although a single service cannot meet diverse requirements of di_erent situations, it is hard to deploy and configure a variety of devices for each of envisioned services. To solve the problem, we propose a mechanism to dynamically self-organize service networks by combining existing devices. In our proposal, we adopt a mathematical model of division of labors in a colony of social insects to accomplish autonomous selection of devices, which o_er sensing and control functions to a service network, while taking into account their states and service requirements. Through simulation, we confirmed that our proposal can organize e_cient service networks combining nodes with higher residual energy and more service provision.
Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) is considered to be the key enabler for realizing capacity goals set by 5G. The major concern in UDN deployment is the backhaul network, which should be scalable, cost-effective, and have sufficient capacity to support massive small cell traffic. Otherwise, the backhaul can become the bottleneck of the network. In this paper, we propose a wireless backhaul solution for UDN deployment by considering MultiPath-MultiHop (MPMH) backhaul architecture in mmWave frequency band. In addition, we propose a distributed routing scheme to forward the backhaul traffic over the multihop network. Backhaul capacity and line-of-sight probability of the proposed backhaul architecture for various picocell densities were compared with direct, multiple-association, and multihop backhaul schemes under interference limited scenarios in outdoor and indoor small cell deployments. The simulation results indicate that the MPMH mmWave backhaul is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for UDN deployment.
The availability of multiple channels in Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET) enhances the options of utilizing channels efficiently for achieving improved system performance in terms of throughput, end-to-end and communication overhead that impacts spectral efficiency. However, ensuring quality of service (QoS) in multichannel ad hoc networks is crucial and most of the existing signaling and adaptation mechanisms for QoS available in the literature mainly supports fixed-width channels or variable-width channels that restrict network performance. In this paper, we propose a Hyper-Erlang Channel Allocation Factor-based QoS Enhancement Mechanism (HECAFQEM) for improving the support capability of ad hoc networks. HECAFQEM uses a composite model that models the availability and performance of the prevailing channel conditions through Hyper-Erlang Factor that quantifies the rate of rejection of the network. The degree of rejection of user request depends on queuing delay, transmission delay and two significant parameter called Channel Allocation factor (CAF) and Expected Channel Allocation Factor (ECAF). The QoS adaptations are performed by HECAFQEM by measuring the queuing delay that helps in segmenting the packet stream into small bursts for enhancing the degree of QoS. This distributed mechanism enhances QoS through the estimation of Channel Allocation Factor (CAF) that dynamically adapts channel widths in a multichannel ad-hoc network to suit bandwidth adaptability. The performance analysis of HECAFQEM is carried out based on ns-2 simulator and the proposed approach shows an improvement on an average by 23% and 19% in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput than the existing QoS adaptation mechanisms available in the literature.
The commercial building and residential sectors are responsible for 27% of the global electricity consumption, with cooling and heating loads being the dominant contributors. Much of the thermal energy inside of buildings is wasted by means of transmission through conventional windows. Low emissivity (low-e) windows have been incorporated as an effective method to minimize energy utilisation because of their ability to reflect external heat radiation, thus reducing cooling loads. Such windows have been widely used in the architectural and automotive sectors to block both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation from the Sun. The windows consist of multi-layer thin coatings (metallic and dielectric layers), which are highly transparent in the visible but reflective to IR radiation (heat). However, the metallic layers attenuate telecommunication signals used for modern-day telecommunications such as radio frequency (RF) and microwave (μW) signals. As there is an ever-increasing demand for a reliable interior to exterior mobile communication coverage, these windows need to be transparent for reliable wireless communication. A class of engineered materials is a promising solution to improve signal transmission through low-e windows; by applying a frequency selective surface (FSS) pattern onto the window. FSS can be realised by producing a periodic of repetitive shapes incorporated onto the window surface to filter selective electromagnetic waves. This review highlights the FSS patterning technique applied onto low-e windows to allow for low attenuation transmission of telecommunication signals.                        This study performs a critical review of the FSS technique on low-e windows.        The review highlights the telecommunication signals attenuation on low-e windows.        The FSS technique reduces the attenuation of telecommunication signals.        An overview of different FSS patterns on low-e windows.        Discussion of current challenges and future perspectives.
Wireless Mesh Networks is increasingly being applied widely with explosive traffic demand. This leads to a great challenge for traditional routing protocols in ensuring Quality of Service. We propose a QoS-guaranteed intelligent routing algorithm in this paper for WMN with heavy traffic load using reinforcement learning to improve its performance. We build a reward function for the Q-Learning algorithm to choose a route so that the packet delivery ratio is the highest. Concurrently, the learning rate coefficient is flexibly changed to determine constraints of the end-to-end delay. Our performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm has significantly improved performance compared with other well-known routing algorithms.
The use of smart home technology in the home or building o_ers significant potential for energy savings. In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on wireless sensor networks. The proposed system is composed of two main components: a wireless sensor network and an intelligent home gateway. Wireless sensors are used for sensing and transmitting electricity data and remote monitoring and control of home appliances are provided to users through the intelligent home gateway. The system enables users to save energy by monitoring and controlling home appliances through web and mobile devices.
The expected commute times for a strongly connected directed graph are related to an asymmetric Laplacian matrix as a direct extension to similar well known formulas for undirected graphs. We show the close relationships between the asymmetric Laplacian and the so-called Fundamental matrix. We give bounds for the commute times in terms of the stationary probabilities for a random walk over the graph together with the asymmetric Laplacian and show how this can be approximated by a symmetrized Laplacian derived from a related weighted undirected graph.
One of the major challenges in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is to prolong the lifetime of network. Tra- ditional research work focuses on minimizing transmit power; however, in the case of short range communication the consumption power in decoding is significantly larger than transmit power. This paper investigates the minimization of total power consumption by reducing the decoding power consumption. For achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER), we introduce some fundamental results on the basis of iterative message-passing algorithms for Low Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy dissipation in decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are considered. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code rates and introduce Adaptive Itera- tive Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold on the number of iterations for a certain BER (10−4). In iterative LDPC decoding, the total energy consumption of network is reduced by 20 - 25%.
In this paper we show that for each     , the order-     shuffle-exchange network can be emulated by an     -node linear processor array or an        -node mesh in a work-preserving manner. An emulation of a computation on a guest network             on a host network        , if the time-processor products are equal to within a constant factor. To achieve this result we demonstrate a uniform many-to-one embedding of the nodes of a shuffle-exchange network into a linear array. We then give a simple, deterministic routing algorithm on the linear array which schedules the communication of messages necessary to achieve the emulation within the required time bounds. The analysis of the algorithm relies on certain statistical properties of the complex plane diagram of the shuffle-exchange network.
Driven by falling prices, continuous miniaturization and increasing functionality, low power wireless networks tap into new application areas. But an efficient utilization of embedded systems is hindered by lacks in interoperability and flexibility, because they are proprietary. In this paper, an approach for an abstraction layer in the area of embedded systems with respect to low power wireless networks is presented. This layer is used to harmonize interfaces between network-node and application functionality like sensors. The overall goal is to design a dedicated modular low power wireless network with a flexible structure and topology.
In this paper, we incorporate the idea of waveband switching in Mixed Line Rates (MLR) network design to address the problem of dynamic traffic grooming in waveband switching networks by investigating a cost function which take the effect of call holding time on the time slot assignment process of in WDM–TDM. Use has been made of Markov model in order to predict the wavelength congestion. A routing algorithm is developed based on the Markov modeling. The results are compared with existing routing algorithms – Available Shortest Path (ASP) and Online Traffic Grooming Algorithm (OTGA). Validation results have shown that the performance of the proposed system is significantly improved in terms of bandwidth blocking ratio, network utilization as well as port saving due to wavebanding.
Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) are the backbone of the blooming Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The routing protocols play crucial role in the efficiency and management of the scarce resources of LLNs. RPL is the popular routing protocol for LLNs and its efficiency depends on the routing metrics used. The default objective functions of RPL use hop count and Expected Transmission Count (ETX). In denser networks, congestion is caused, and the objective functions require optimization. This paper aims at providing an optimization of RPL by creating a new strategy of amalgamating the existing sigma routing metric and enhanced routing metric. Contiki Cooja simulator is used for simulating the results. The results are evaluated with the default objective functions, sigma routing, and enhanced objective function. The neo-hybrid composite routing metric (NCRM) outperforms all the other in packet delivery ratio, network life time, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.
Graphical abstract                                       In this paper, an in band and out of band microwave wireless power transmission characteristic analysis of slot ring radome based on an approximate analytical method is proposed.        The main contribution of this paper is that for the approximate analysis of ring radome, the unified expression of the incident field on the radome surface with E-plane and H-plane scanning is derived, and the ring is approximated as 30 segments of straight strips. Solving the corresponding 60 × 60 linear equations yields the electric current distribution along the ring strip.        The magnetic current along the complementary slot ring is obtained by dual. Benefitting from the fully analytical format of the current distribution, the microwave wireless power transmission characteristics are efficiently calculated using Munk’s scheme.        An example of a slot ring biplanar symmetric hybrid radome verifies the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme. The CPU time is about 690 s and 2.82 s for HFSS and the proposed method, respectively.              In this paper, an in-band and out-of-band microwave wireless power-transmission characteristic analysis of a slot ring radome based on an approximate analytical method is proposed.

In Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), the distribution of certificate revocation information is a security issue to provide safety and efficiency in the transportation system. Most of the current approaches are based on distributing a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) that incurs a large communication overhead, storage space, and checking time. In this work, we propose an efficient revocation scheme based on the use of fog computing and Merkle hash trees replacing the time consuming CRL checking process. More specifically, we divide the roadway into several domains, in which fog nodes manage the vehicles in a localized manner. Then, we utilize Merkle hash trees to provide a highly scalable way to disseminate the revocation information and ensure the integrity of the certificate’s status. The performance analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of verification delay compared with the conventional mechanisms.
Extreme weather-related events are likely to increase in both frequency and intensity if current emission rates continue. Particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of climate change is the transportation sector, which fully relies on the uninterrupted accessibility of the road network. With the Swedish Government adopting a National Adaptation Strategy in 2018, creating a coordinated cross-disciplinary strategy underpinned by international frameworks, new ambition levels regarding climate change adaptation efforts have been established. Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories from upcoming IPCC reports.
In mobile wireless sensor networks, Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) based multipath routing protocols performs good in terms of energy consumption, delay, throughput etc. This paper strives to analyze and compare the experimental evaluation of M-DART, proactive multipath protocol, and AOMDV, reactive multipath protocol using Network Simulator. Different simulation experiments were performed to check the behavior of both of these multipath routing protocols for Mobile WSN scenario and we observed that MDART outperforms AOMDV in terms of energy consumption, end to end delay, throughput and packet loss percentage.
This work presents an improved simulation model for product pipelines in the oil industry.        The methodology handles multiple refineries in a mesh-like pipeline network.        The proposed simulator is capable to validate scheduling plan or offer corrections.        The improved simulation model can handle reroute, split, and reverse the flow direction of the products in the pipe.              One of the tasks of an oil company is to fulfil site demands. Since not all sites have production, it is essential to transport products between sites. The order of pumping operations is determined by the scheduling plan. The scheduling plan includes the type and quantity of products to be delivered, the start of deliveries, and routes. The type and quantity of products to be delivered, the start of deliveries and routes are included in the scheduling plan. A scheduling plan is feasible if it does not contain inconsistencies. Checking a one-month schedule is a complex task in real multi-source mesh-like pipeline networks, thus it is advisable to use a discrete event simulation system. This work presents improvements on our previous simulation model. In the improved simulation model, it is possible to reroute, split, and reverse the flow direction of the products in the pipe, amongst other things.
In the last few years, parallel processing systems have been studied very actively, and, given the huge number of computing nodes now involved in modern supercomputers, many topologies have been proposed to efficiently connect all these CPUs. A torus and its variants are such topologies popular as interconnection networks of massively parallel systems. Torus-connected cycles (TCC) have been introduced recently, building on the interesting properties or tori and enabling nodes clustering. In this paper, we present an algorithm that solves the container problem in a TCC. This problem consists in finding mutually node-disjoint paths between any pair of nodes. In a   T CC    k, n  ), the proposed algorithm finds paths of lengths at most [          + ([    /2] + 4)n − 3 in O(n      + kn     ) time. Lastly, an empirical evaluation is conducted to inspect the practical behaviour of this algorithm.
Media transmission in the context of constrained IoT devices is of critical importance to support several solutions that enable interaction with the physical environment. This includes solutions that range from scenarios of occupancy estimation in building automation to traditional audio and image processing in remote sensing. Many modern access side IoT networks follow   Event Driven Architecture   (EDA) topologies that rely on brokers to forward messages between endpoints. The   Message Queuing Telemetry Transport   (MQTT) is one such protocol that can be used to encapsulate well known   Real Time Protocol   (RTP) audio and media packets. Unfortunately, MQTT relies on TCP transport that is not well suited in IoT constrained environments. This paper introduces a scheme that leverages some of the MQTT features to enable the reliable transmission of media in the context of   Lossy Low Power Networks   (LLNs). Specifically, this scheme is presented, analyzed, optimized and compared against other state-of-the-art mechanisms.
While transport infrastructure and travel demand are known to be correlated, their causal relationship has not been systematically investigated. Granger causality tests have been conducted in the context of transport infrastructure and economic growth, and land use and transport. This research extends their application to network investments and travel demand by examining the co-evolution of public transport access and ridership in the Greater Sydney region for a period spanning over a century, from 1855 onward. We hypothesise a mutual feedback between public transport ridership and access, and corroborate the hypothesis in all causal models estimated – between aggregate public transport ridership and access, station ridership and access, and mesh block public transport shares and access. The causality was more evident in disaggregate models and was stronger between ridership and access to jobs than with access to population when employment data were available. Ours is the first longitudinal investigation into the causal relationship between public transport access and ridership. The findings strengthen the case for using access as a planning measure and lay the groundwork for evolutionary strategic transport modelling.
The comprehensive study has been done on the blackout phenomena observed in Pakistan.        Different solutions are proposed to reduce power outages and fulfill the consumer's requirements.        Cutting-edge storage solutions have been proposed to avoid blackouts in Pakistan's Power Infrastructure.              Power systems are the most complicated networks that play a crucial role in daily lifestyles. To operate such systems in a stable condition, several control and protection strategies are required. Despite preventative measures, power systems still experience issues and breakdowns like power outages. However, severe and unanticipated conditions might cause damage to the entire system and causes blackout. In this article we studied the analysis of the significant blackouts and cascading failures that have been happened in Pakistan in last few years. The authors proposed a new infrastructure for Pakistan energy sector by introducing advanced energy storage system and cutting edge technology like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology that make the existing power system robust against these phenomena. The advanced energy storage systems include like solid- state batteries that play a vital role to balance supply and demand, while V2G enables electric vehicles to contribute to grid stability. The potential of these technologies is helpful to improve the grid stability and facilitate a sustainable energy transition. The role of various electric companies in Pakistan power infrastructure has also been discussed after an occurrence of such unplanned events in power system. It has been noted that the main cause of power outages is fluctuation in frequency and voltage collapse. Finally, various solutions have been proposed to overcome these problems and make sure the reliability and stability of power grid against blackout phenomena.
The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options and Destination Options Extension Headers have historically faced challenges in deployment due to a lack of router support coupled with concerns around potential for denial-of-service attacks. However, there has been a renewed interest within the standards community both in simplifying their processing, and in using these extension headers for new applications. Through a wide-scale measurement campaign, we show that many autonomous systems in both access networks and the core of the Internet do permit the traversal of packets that include options, and that the path traversal currently depends on the type of network, size of the option and the transport protocol used, but does not usually depend on the type of included option. This is an encouraging result when considering the extensibility of IPv6. We show that packets that include an extension header can also impact the function of load balancing network devices, and present evidence of equipment mis-configuration, noting that a different path to the same destination can result in a different traversal result. Finally, we outline the current deployment challenges and provide recommendations for how extension headers can utilise options to extend IPv6.
The interconnection design in computing clusters and data centers is expected to change significantly in the near future to sustain the increasing communication demand at controlled capitalization and operational cost. In particular, a shift from typ- ical and expensive full-bisection bandwidth interconnects (which safely cover the worst communication cases) to application oriented designs (which may provide cost-efficient data movement at larger system scales) is devised in academic research and industry initiatives. Having information of communication dynamics of applications (e.g. repetitiveness, computing and communication phases, traffic pattern and bandwidth, etc.) allows for efficiently managing and provisioning of network re- sources at reduced cost. This paper presents an   Application-Aware Predictive and Distributed Routing Balancing   technique (PR-DRB), a new method that controls network inefficiencies based on communication patterns of applications and speculative routing, PR-DRB monitors increments in the communication latency and, then, dynamically re-distributes the network traffic over multiple paths (path expansion) to deal with load unbalances. Additionally, PR-DRB stores the number of paths used to balance the traffic (solution) and links it to the application's pattern that caused the unbalance (problem). This information allows PR-DRB to respond to similar situations in repetitive patterns, quickly converging to a stable solution. Evaluation results show latency and completion time reductions of up to 37% for experiments conducted on 64 nodes executing the NAS benchmarks and the Lammps application.
Advanced control strategies for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems aim to enhance both buildings' energy efficiency and occupant thermal comfort. Despite their potential, real-world demonstration studies on such advanced technologies are still lacking. This study presents a field demonstration of a real-time predicted mean vote (PMV)-based HVAC control strategy in a typical residential building under hot and dry climate conditions. This study introduces an advanced thermal comfort-based controller (TCC) for the PMV-based HVAC control. TCC continually assesses indoor and outdoor thermal conditions and adjusts the HVAC setpoint temperature to optimize real-time energy use while ensuring satisfactory indoor thermal comfort. Machine learning models for the PMV-based HVAC control system are employed to estimate a mean radiant temperature (MRT) point, which is one of the variables used to calculate real-time PMV values. Three machine learning models (i.e., linear regression, regression trees, and artificial neural network) are adopted in this study with non-stationary real-time input values, including times, pre-determined setpoints, and indoor and outdoor temperatures. The developed TCC is installed in a full-scale experimental house in Kuwait, which is under hot and dry climate conditions, to assess the house's indoor thermal comfort and AC energy efficiency performance. Results indicate that the TCC provides better thermal comfort performance compared to the non-TCC case, including up to a 60% improvement in PMV. The proposed TCC controlled by the machine learning methods demonstrates HVAC energy savings potential of over 20% while meeting the desired thermal comfort levels in the experimental building. These findings are expected to be valuable, as they can contribute to reducing cooling energy in residential buildings in hot and dry climate conditions.                       A real-time predicted mean vote-based air-conditioning control method is proposed.        This study utilizes various data-driven models for extimating mean radiant temperature.        The effectiveness of thermal comfort-integrated air-conditioning control is demonstrated through a case study in Kuwait.
Electric vehicles (EVs) are environment friendly and are expected to find tremendous growth in the near future. However, the short voyaging reach and the lack of charging lattice have impeded the large-scale application of EVs. A choice of a particular route for EV is largely dependent on the availability of charging stations on that route as well as the ease of charging facility offered by the charging station (including state of the charging station, user convenience, etc.). Hence, it is vital to delve into the challenge of locating a charging station that offers the utmost user convenience in charging EVs. This paper attempts to present a solution to this very problem. The proposed approach is an improvised distributed system, namely,                  (Smart Search of Route and Charging) which plans an energy efficient EV route considering EV’s state-of-charge (SoC) level, traffic conditions, the frequency of charging stations and the state of charging station (the charging resources of the charging station along with their occupancy levels, etc.). This distributed architecture employs the proposed agile charging slot reservation approach for the EVs that wish to get recharged at a particular charging station. Besides, to delineate the interactive mechanism of EVs recharging, three non-identical objective functions are formulated to minimize the overall energy consumption of EVs, waiting time at charging station, and total charging expenditure. After performing the extensive simulations on the weighted directed real transportation graph of Chandigarh, India, the proposed                  system recommends a charging station in accordance to the preferences given by the EV user. Case studies verify the significance and validity of the proposed model in terms of energy efficiency and user convenience.
Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), which correspond to a novel wireless technology, are widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) systems such as drones, wireless sensor networks, and military or disaster relief communication. From the perspective of communication and data collection, the success rate of collaborations between nodes in mobile ad hoc networks and reliability of data collection mainly depend on whether the nodes in the network operate normally, namely, according to the established network rules. However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed. This protocol has minimal effect on the original communication dynamics and can effectively deal with Packet drop, wormhole, Session hijacking, and other main attacks in MANETs. The NS3 simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol attains good transmission performance, can effectively identify various attacks and bypass malicious nodes, and securely complete the communication process.
A new kind of dynamic RWA algorithm with QoS and link protection mechanism under the constraint of wavelength continuity is presented. Using a peculiar link protection method, a protection routing is established with unique links and working routing for every service request. Additionally, the wavelength information is taken into account to make the entire network load balanced with respect to routing choice. It is known that when the network is trouble-free, load balance is needed, and when there are some links destroyed in the network, a protection mechanism is needed. This new algorithm includes these two mechanisms while also adopting a kind of QoS guaranteed mechanism. This allows for a better network performance even under the situation that some links were destroyed and includes a higher quality of service guarantee and a lower rate of service blocking. The simulation results show that this algorithm can significantly improve the rate of service blocking and guarantee the quality of service to meet expectations.
Hypercube is a popular and more attractive interconnection networks. The attractive properties of hypercube caused the derivation of more variants of hypercube. In this paper, we have proposed two variants of hypercube which was called as “Fractal Cubic Network Graphs”, and we have investigated the Hamiltonian-like properties of Fractal Cubic Network Graphs                    . Firstly, Fractal Cubic Network Graphs                     are defined by a fractal structure. Further, we show the construction and characteristics analyses of                                              . Therefore,                     is a Hamiltonian graph which is obtained by using Gray Code for                                  is not a Hamiltonian Graph. Furthermore, we have obtained a recursive algorithm which is used to label the nodes of                    . Finally, we get routing algorithms on                     by utilizing routing algorithms on the hypercubes.
In traditional IoT applications, energy saving is essential while high bandwidth is not always required. However, a new wave of IoT applications exhibit stricter requirements in terms of bandwidth and latency. Broadband technologies like Wi-Fi could meet such requirements. Nevertheless, these technologies come with limitations: high energy consumption and limited coverage range. In order to address these two shortcomings, and based on the recent IEEE 802.11ba amendment, we propose a Wi-Fi-based mesh architecture where devices are outfitted with a supplementary Wake-up Radio (WuR) interface. According to our analytical and simulation studies, this design maintains latency figures comparable to conventional single-interface networks while significantly reducing energy consumption (by up to almost two orders of magnitude). Additionally, we verify via real device measurements that battery lifetime can be increased by as much as 500% with our approach.
In many Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, the availability of a simple yet accurate estimation of the RF channel quality is vital. However, due to measurement noise and fading effects, it is usually estimated through probe or learning based methods, which result in high energy consumption or high overheads. We propose to make use of information redundancy among indicators provided by the IEEE 802.15.4 system to improve the estimation of the link quality. A Kalman filter based solution is used due to its ability to give an accurate estimate of the un-measurable states of a dynamic system subject to observation noise. In this paper we present an empirical study showing that an improved indicator, termed Effective-SNR, can be produced by combining Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) with minimal additional overhead. The estimation accuracy is further improved through the use of Kalman filtering techniques. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be implemented on resource constraints devices typical in WSNs.
In this paper we show how to establish a reliable and efficient high level communication system in a randomly deployed network of sensors equipped with directional antennas. This high level communication system enables the programming of the sensor network using high level communication functionalities without the burden of taking care of their physical capacities (low range, unidirectional links, single frequency, presence of collisions, etc.). The high level communication functionalities we offer include point-to-point communication, point-to-area communication, and one-to-all communication. The basic idea to implement this system is to simulate a virtual network that emerges from the ad-hoc network using self-organization, self-discovery and collaborative methods. We also analyse the efficiency, scalability and robustness of the proposed protocols.
Many trust establishment solutions in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) rely on public key certificates. Therefore, they should be accompanied by an efficient mechanism for certificate revocation and validation. In order to reduce the hazards from nodes and to enhance the security of network we propose to develop a CA distribution and a Trust based threshold revocation method. Initially the trust value is computed from the direct and indirect trust values. And the certificate authorities distributes the secret key to al the nodes. Followed by this a trust based threshold revocation method is computed. Here the misbehaving nodes are eliminated.
This paper studies the video buffer control for streaming video data to mobile devices. We target on the design challenge when the wireless link quality is dynamic due to the the environmental factors or user mobility. We develop a Dynamic and Agile buffor-control scheme, called DAB, that adaptively adjust the video buffer size based on the measurements of the signal strength (RSSI) and accelerometer on the smartphone. Our goal is to keep a smooth playback while delivery as little data as possible to the end-user in order to save bandwidth cost. We have implemented our solution on Android platform and evaluate it with experiments. Compared to the traditional video buffer scheme, our solution DAB significantly improves the performance in terms of the quality of playback and the buffer efficency.
In this contribution, a novel network coding (NC) aided multi-input multi-output (MIMO) scheme is proposed for providing reliable transmission from an ambulance assisting in an emergency situation by cooperating with relaying devices at an emergency scene. Our system is constituted by an Irregular Convolutional Coded Unity Rate Coded Space Time Trellis Coded M-ary Phase Shift Keying (IrCC-URC-STTC-MPSK) scheme invoked for exploiting the benefits of MIMO systems. The system is designed with the aid of Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for approaching the corresponding channel capacity in fast fading environments. The proposed scheme exhibits substantial benefits over conventional MIMO systems in hostile wireless channels.
Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) is a new search algorithm inspired by the balance state of a simple and dynamic mass that is well-mixed on the region of the control volume. In this study, the EO algorithm is applied to the power distribution network reconfiguration (PDNR) for reducing active power loss, enhancing the voltage magnitude, and improving the reliability indices. The main contribution of this study is to provide a broad perspective on solving the reconfiguration problem by statistically comparing popular algorithms in the literature. The other contribution is a new algorithm has been developed for reliability index calculation, and the results are compared with the commercial software Etap. The performance of the EO algorithm has been discussed in four different distribution test systems and compared to ten     -heuristic search algorithms studied in the literature. According to the statistical results of the analyses, the EO algorithm has provided the best performance in the solution of the reconfiguration problem in terms of several aspects such as having a lower error rate and attempting to reach the global optima successfully more than the other ten algorithms. The standard deviations of EO are calculated as 0, 3, 2.7, and 25.6 for 16-bus, 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus test systems, respectively. To sum up, the proposed algorithm shows a competent, efficient and promising solution in PDNR.
Efficient allocation of resources is crucial in wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs) as spectrum assets are costly. Cooperative communications were introduced as a solution to the problem of limited spectrum availability. In this approach, numerous nodes share their resources and increase the bandwidth available to end-users. This research investigates the practicality of a new algorithm that optimizes resources based on load for Cooperative Communications in 5 G WANETs. The algorithm consists of two components. Initially, a distributed algorithm for forming a topology is suggested. This algorithm employs a load-based approach to explore network conditions and efficiently choose the most suitable topology. An optimization algorithm that relies on a greedy strategy is suggested. In this approach, the chosen nodes send their bits to the receiver to maximize the attainable system throughput. A thorough simulation study is conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in assessing existing methods. The proposed model obtained 94.72 % energy efficiency, 91.69 % network throughput, 94.72 % spectrum utilization, 27.47 % network delay, 24.08 % packet loss rate, 94.38 % signal-to-noise ratio, 93.91 % data transfer rate, 95.87 % error detection rate, and 94.28 % link reliability rate. The results demonstrate that the suggested algorithm significantly enhances the system and the overall network performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed approach is feasible and environmentally friendly for optimizing bandwidth in 5 G wireless ad hoc Networks.
In parallel/distributed computing systems, the all-to-all personalized communication (or complete exchange) is required in numerous applications of parallel processing. In this paper, we consider this problem for              stage Multistage Interconnection Networks (MINs). It is proved that the set of admissible permutations for a MIN can be partitioned in Latin Squares. Since routing permutations belonging to a Latin Square provides the all-to-all personalized communication, a method to realize the complete exchange with time complexity O(    ), that is optimal, can be derived. This method, compared with other ones in literature, does not necessitate of neither pre-computation nor memory allocation to record the Latin Square, because an explicit construction of it is not required; furthermore it is applicable to any              stage multistage networks since it is independent of the topology.
Cooperative communication (CC) is a technique that exploits spatial diversity allowing multiple nodes to cooperatively relay signals to the receiver so that it can combine the received signals to obtain the original message. CC can be combined with topology control to increase connectivity at the cost of a small increase in energy consumption. This work focuses on exploring CC to improve the connectivity with a sink node in ad hoc wireless networks. More precisely, this work proposes a new technique, named CoopSink, that combines CC and topology control techniques to increase connectivity to a sink node while ensuring energy-efficient routes. Simulation results show that connectivity and routing to the sink cost can be improved up to 6.8 and 2.3 times, respectively, when compared with other similar strategies.

We propose a rational approximation algorithm for network reliability estimation in this paper. Our algorithm can be applied to estimate both the all-terminal reliability measure and the reliability of networks with various protection algorithms. Our algorithm is very efficient and it can obtain the whole reliability function curve.
-cubes are a class of communication patterns that are employed by a number of typical parallel algorithms. This paper addresses the implementation of parallel algorithms with bidirectional and unidirectional ternary     -cube communication patterns on a mesh WDM optical network. For each of these two communication patterns, a routing and wavelength assignment scheme is described, and the number of wavelengths required is shown to attain the minimum, which guarantees the optimality of the proposed scheme.
The expected number of transmission (    ) represents a routing metric that considers the highly variable link qualities for a specific radio in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To adapt to these differences, radio diversity is a recently explored solution for WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy balancing metric which explores the diversity in link qualities present at different radios. The goal is to effectively use the energy of the network and therefore extend the network lifetime. The proposed metric takes into account the transmission and reception costs for a specific radio in order to choose an energy efficient radio. In addition, the metric uses the remaining energy of nodes in order to regulate the traffic so that critical nodes are avoided. We show by simulations that our metric can improve the network lifetime up to 20%.
In this paper, we address wireless sensor network localization problems that have high reliability in an environment where physical node destruction is possible. We propose a new security localization algorithm TVSL (Threshold and Vote Security Localization) for wireless sensor network (WSN). This algorithm improves the safety performance of positioning process of nodes in WSN by using the threshold idea and vote with sensor nodes. The advantage of this algorithm is that no additional hardware is needed, easy integration with other localization algorithms, and the safety performance of localization algorithm is improved obviously. From the simulation of this algorithm, we get the expected results.
Collaborative Beamforming (CB) is an essential tool towards achieving long-range transmission in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In some instances, there may be multiple intended data destinations (sinks) in a WSN. This calls for multi-CB. In comparison to sink-by-sink CB, multi-CB implies improved data rates and decreased co-channel interference; and consequently increased network capacity. In current literature, there is no research in multi-CB particularly in 3-dimension WSNs. In this paper, a novel multi-CB mechanism is brought to the fore. This is from the point of view of a random arrangement of sensor nodes in a 3-dimension manner. It is assumed that all sinks' directions are known at the CB cluster head. Node transmit amplitude and phase are optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm variant to concurrently achieve balanced multiple narrow beams and minimal radiation in undesired directions. The performance of the proposed scheme is checked against that of a pure multiple beam steering approach (without beam power balancing and minimization of radiation in undesired directions). Moreover, an analysis of beam power, width and steering accuracy is done upon varying the number of collaborating nodes and the collaborating cluster radius. Increasing the count of collaborating nodes yields improved beam precision/accuracy, lower radiation in undesired directions and appreciable stability in beam power performance Increasing the collaborating nodes' cluster radius yields narrow beams, improved beam precision and appreciably lower radiation in undesired directions. The contributions of this work to current literature include: (i) formulation and analysis of a multiple beamforming scheme in the realm of 3-dimension WSNs; (ii) design of a multi-CB scheme taking into account minimization of radiation in undesired directions; (iii) a statistical multi-CB performance analysis upon varying collaborating nodes' cluster radius and collaborating node count.

Routing in all optical networks is an important issue. Deflection routing provides a high throughput but suffers from unbounded transportation time. Convergence routing provides ending guarantee to packets entering the network. We focus on the Eulerian routing technique (convergence routing based on an Eulerian directed cycle), and several improvements which increase the throughput. In this paper, we show that these routing algorithms are very unstable when the traffic occurs by bursts. Thus an admission control is needed to maintain a high throughput.
Over the next few years, the Industrial Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN), which is a major part of the Industrial Object Internet (IIoT), will play a crucial role in transforming the industrial world by opening a new era of economic and competitive growth in the Industrial Revolution known as "Industry 4.0". IIoT is able to help organizations achieve better benefits in industrial manufacturing markets by increasing productivity, reducing costs and developing new services and products. In this paper we present a wireless industrial communication system based on Node-RED platform using Modbus protocol for smart factories.
In today's world, Bluetooth technology is integrated into almost every device we use, from wireless headsets, mice, and keyboards to cars and smart home devices. But with the convenience of this technology comes the risk of privacy and security breaches. Each Bluetooth device has potential vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit and take advantage of. It is important to create awareness about various Bluetooth vulnerabilities, exploits, and ways to prevent them. This article examines the dark side of Bluetooth technology by explaining how hackers can find ways to bypass the advanced security features of laptops, phones, cars, or smart home devices to compromise the devices and steal personal sensitive data. Whether it is a casual user of Bluetooth technology or a business owner with multiple devices, understanding these risks is crucial to protecting yourself and your information.    This article begins by explaining the basics of Bluetooth technology and how it works. Followed by a list of security risks involved while using Bluetooth and finally, it highlights the best practices to protect the devices and the data they contain.
Software defined networking (SDN) is a recent networking architectural framework which aims to provide the complete separation of data plane and control plane. Openflow is a well-known architecture that facilitates SDN. The core idea of Openflow is to control the switch or router through programming from the centralized controller. The connection reliability is a major concern for the network service providers. The analysis of network resiliency is required for this new paradigm. The resiliency is the network's ability to survive against attacks and other component failures. This paper focuses on a comparison of different data forwarding algorithms currently supported by the POX standards for protection and restoration. Understanding existing approaches or standards in SDN plays a crucial role in network resiliency or protection and restoration. We also provide the extension of one of the components in POX for improvement. The restoration scheme in the current POX components as well as in the modified component is evaluated and compared.
An IoT-based AQMS is designed and fabricated to measure environmental parameters, including PM          , CO, SO     , NO     , temperature, and humidity.        A new algorithm based on Arduino IDE is implemented to gather information from multiple air quality sensors and send it as a single packet of multiple payloads over the LoRaWAN gateway to the TTN platform.        The ThingSpeak IoT server is integrated with the TTN platform as a means of posting the gathered air quality statistics in real time via the Internet.        A ThingSpeak public channel dashboard and a Virtuino GUI linked to an IoT server are developed, enabling users to access air quality information anytime and anywhere.               This study proposes a smart long-range (LoRa) sensing node to timely collect the air quality information and update it on the cloud. The developed long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN)-based Internet of Things (IoT) air quality monitoring system (AQMS), hereafter called LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS, was deployed in an outdoor environment to validate its reliability and effectiveness. The system is composed of multiple sensors (NO     , SO     , CO     , CO, PM     , temperature, and humidity), Arduino microcontroller, LoRa shield, LoRaWAN gateway, and The Thing Network (TTN) IoT platform. The LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS is a standalone system powered continuously by a rechargeable battery with a photovoltaic solar panel via a solar charger shield for sustainable operation. Our system simultaneously gathers the considered air quality information by using the smart sensing unit. Then, the system transmits the information through the gateway to the TTN platform, which is integrated with the ThingSpeak IoT server. This action updates the collected data and displays these data on a developed Web-based dashboard and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that uses the Virtuino mobile application. Thus, the displayed information can be easily accessed by users via their smartphones. The results obtained by the developed LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS are validated by comparing them with experimental results based on the high-technology Aeroqual air quality monitoring devices. Our system can reliably monitor various air quality indicators and efficiently transmit the information in real time over the Internet.       Graphical abstract             Image, graphical abstract
As the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks technologies face a series of challenges like dynamic changes of topological structure, existence of unidirectional channel, limited wireless transmission bandwidth, the capability limitations of mobile termination and etc, therefore, the research to mobile Ad Hoc network routings inevitablely undertake a more important task than those to other networks. Multicast is a mode of communication transmission oriented to group computing, which sends the data to a group of host computers by using single source address. In a typical mobile Ad Hoc Network environment, multicast has a significant meaning. On the one hand, the users of mobile Ad Hoc Network usually need to form collaborative working groups; on the other hand, this is also an important means of fully using the broadcast performances of wireless communication and effectively using the limited wireless channel resources. This paper summarizes and comparatively analyzes the routing mechanisms of various existing multicast routing protocols according to the characteristics of mobile Ad Hoc network.
Currently, China's building materials market is large and the supply and demand transactions are very frequent, which requires us to have a comprehensive understanding of the supply and demand transactions of building materials. Based on complex network theory, this paper constructs a complex network model of supply and demand of building materials. And the Louvain algorithm is also improved to identify and characterize the network community relations based on the characteristics of this network. This paper also applies prefabricated components as an example for empirical research and obtains the following findings: (1) From 2017 to 2022, large- and medium-sized communities in the network gradually increase while small communities gradually decrease; the internal connectivity of large communities is higher than that of small communities; and the regional network also has the structural characteristics of the network. (2) The characteristics of geographic agglomeration gradually emerge in the individual communities in the supply–demand network of prefabricated components with the passage of time. Most of these communities are bounded by provinces, and large-scale communities are distributed in the eastern and southern coastal areas. Thus, this paper visualizes the supply and demand of construction materials to provide a theoretical basis and methodological support for the supply and demand of construction materials and the development of the construction industry.
Data is becoming increasingly personal. Individuals regularly interact with a variety of structured data, ranging from SQLite databases on the phone to personal sensors and open government data. The “digital traces left by individuals through these interactions” are sometimes referred to as “small data”. Examples of “small data” include driving records, biometric measurements, search histories, weather forecasts and usage alerts. In this paper, we present a flexible protocol called LoRaCTP, which is based on LoRa technology that allows data “chunks” to be transferred over large distances with very low energy expenditure. LoRaCTP provides all the mechanisms necessary to make LoRa transfer reliable by introducing a lightweight connection setup and allowing the ideal sending of an as-long-as necessary data message. We designed this protocol as communication support for small-data edge-based IoT solutions, given its stability, low power usage, and the possibility to cover long distances. We evaluated our protocol using various data content sizes and communication distances to demonstrate its performance and reliability.
In present days, development in chip technology enables us to incorporate heterogonous cores on one chip. Synchronization and communication between such diverse cores is a major issue. Current Synchronous NOC architecture with buffered router consumes a substantial chip area and Power (clock distribution & I/O buffers). Hence in recent times Buffer-less routers based on Deflective routing are projected as a possible solution, but they suffers from issues like sequential port allocation and slow critical path and also increases the Latency. In this paper we propose 2D 4x4 Asynchronous Mesh NOC architecture with a novel router design using XY routing algorithm. In the proposed router design, we have eliminated the conventional input and output buffers and crossbar switch. We integrated priority encoder and FSM based Arbiter which efficiently solves long critical path issues of conventional Buffer less router by dynamically changing the port priority and hence solves the starvation and Live/Dead lock issue and improves the Area Consumption (i.e., reduced by ≈ 43%). We have used parallel transmission which enables us to improve Speed (by ≈73%) and elimination of I/O buffers reduces the power consumption (≈ 0.56w).
FiWi support high speed transmission rate, hence any kind of failure may result in huge data loss. To prevent this, there is a requirement to design more survivable and reliable network. In FiWi networks there are two types of failures viz. ONU level failure and segment /OLT level failure. In the present work, to handle segment level failure, we propose an efficient algorithm viz. “Fully Mesh based protection scheme”. In the proposed algorithm we connect backup ONUs from each segment in a fully mesh fashion. Simulation result shows that proposed algorithm improves network survivability in terms of reduced blocking probability.
Within the framework of numerical simulation and optimal control of partial differential equations, in this work we deal with the mathematical modelling and optimal management of urban road networks. In particular, we are interested in finding the optimal management of the network intersections in order to reduce traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution. So, we consider two different multi-objective control problems (the former from a cooperative viewpoint, the latter within a hierarchical paradigm), propose a complete numerical algorithm to solve them, and, finally, present several numerical tests for a realistic case posed in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (Mexico), where the possibilities of our methodology are shown.
In the rapidly evolving metaverse ecosystem, video streaming plays a vital role, offering immersive, on-demand experiences and engaging users in dynamic 3D virtual environments. Point cloud video streaming enables detailed 3D representations for applications like 3D scanning, AR, and VR. However, high data demands and complex encoding pose challenges, requiring efficient resource and latency management. As a result, user experience (UX) is critical in the metaverse, where metrics like real-time feedback, Quality of Experience (QoE), and adaptive UX design are essential for sustaining engagement in immersive 3D environments. Therefore, this paper closely examines the latest developments in point cloud video streaming, specifically focusing on user-centric, AI-driven, and low-latency techniques, transcending traditional video streaming methods. We investigate a variety of techniques, pinpoint obstacles, and chart prospective routes for elevating both the quality and depth of immersive experiences. Furthermore, our work includes a detailed qualitative comparison of these streaming paradigms. We also shed light on pivotal metaverse enhancers, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Visible Light Communication (VLC), advanced network coding techniques, and the integration of the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). These enablers—particularly when combined with DPDK’s capabilities in efficient data packet processing—have the potential to optimize resource allocation, strengthen reliability, reduce latency, and improve the sustainability of point cloud video streaming. Our study, therefore, offers a holistic overview of the advancing area of point cloud video streaming and outlines paths for future research and development.
Wandering is one of the most frequent, problematic, and injurious behaviors of elderly people with dementia. It often leads to negative consequences such as falling and getting lost. With increasing proliferation of sensing, communication, and computing techniques, inexpensive technological solutions have been developed to tackle problems associated with wandering. In this article, we review field research and technological solutions on wandering in the context of assisted living for the elderly. Specifically, we present the most cited definition and classification for wandering proposed in wandering behavior research. We further examine existing solutions for managing wandering in terms of our proposed categorization of wandering research, namely event monitoring-based wandering discovery, trajectory tracking-based wandering detection, and location combined with Geofence-based prevention of wandering-related adverse results. Based on the definition, categorization, and the state of the art, we discuss the major research challenges and future directions in detecting wandering locomotion in different settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on wandering and technological solutions in this niche area of ambient assisted living.
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) defines different data delivery services that can be used in order to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as flexibility and efficiency. In this paper a new distributed Master-Slave model was introduced to compare the Performance between the centralized and distributed Network models in order to support QoS in fixed WiMAX with respect to throughput, delay and application response time parameters, to enhance the services that are provided to the end users. The design has been evaluated using the simulation tool OPNET modeler 16.0. The results obtained from the two models shows significant increase in the network throughput and drastic decrease in network delay and application response time. The results in scenario1 of two models shows the throughput increases from 50,000bit/sec to 100,000bit/sec, delay decrease from 0.0060/sec to 0.0040/sec and application response time decrease from 0.80/sec to 0.58 which greatly enhances the QoS performance.
We introduce a state-based model that can be used in specifying and verifying the desired properties of sensor network protocols. This model accommodates several characteristics that are common in sensor networks. Examples of these characteristics are unavoidable local broadcast, probabilistic message transmission, asymmetric communication, message collision, and timeout actions and randomization steps. We also propose three methods for analyzing a sensor network protocol specified in the model. In the first method, called   nondeterministic analysis  , a specified sensor network protocol is shown to be “nondeterministically correct” under the assumption that message delivery is assured and message collision is guaranteed not to occur. In the second method, called   probabilistic analysis  , the protocol is shown to be “probabilistically correct” under the assumption that message delivery is probabilistic but message collision is guaranteed not to occur. In the third method, called   collision analysis  , the effect of message collision and probabilistic message delivery on the correctness of the protocol is analyzed. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we discuss an example protocol that can be used by a sensor to identify its strong neighbors in the network, and apply the analysis methods to the protocol. Using our model, we also show that the protocol satisfies a desirable property, called self-stabilization property.
Adaptive and fault-tolerant schemes for routing messages in a 2D torus interconnection network for distributed memory multi-computers (message passing concurrent computers) are presented. For the adaptive scheme, two new techniques, channel switching and dimension switching, are developed and proved deadlock-free. For the fault-tolerant scheme, a message can be rerouted to a virtual destination, which in turn sends the message to the real destination. This scheme can tolerate all single faults and many multiple faults, and is deadlock-free. The two routing schemes are suitable for the high performance virtual cut-through and wormhole routing. The required hardware overhead for realizing the fault-tolerant scheme is small and no time penalty is paid in the fault-free case.
Wireless ad-hoc networks are characterized by a collection of wireless mobile nodes that dynamically form a temporary network without the use of any pre-defined network infrastructure or centralized administration. They have attributes such multi-hop wireless connectivity, continuously changing topology and easy deployment. The increasing demands that are made by users pose a challenge in the improvement of the quality of wireless ad-hoc networks. The performance of wireless ad-hoc networks depend on the efficiency of routing protocols, especially the routing metric operating within it. In this paper, the performance of the recently proposed routing metric Interference Bandwidth Adjusted Expected transmission count (IBETX) metric is compared with two prominent existing metrics, the Expected transmission count (ETX) and the Inverse Expected Transmission count (InvETX) over the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. The performance differentials are analysed using varying packet rates and node densities. From the simulations results, IBETX metric outperforms the ETX and InvETX metric because it implements the bandwidth sharing mechanism and makes use of the information available at the MAC layer. It can also be noted that it is very sensitive to data traffic rate. It performs well in low and medium node densities.
Bicycling can improve the sustainability and liveability of cities, many of which desperately require better active transport infrastructure. Urban and transport planners need to examine how improvements in infrastructure change bicyclists' behaviour. With this knowledge, investment in bicycling networks can be more efficient and encourage the use of bicycling for transportation. This study developed a simple Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate bicyclists' movements in response to the built environment and road network characteristics in the City of Penrith, in the Greater Sydney Area, Australia. In this case study, the GAMA platform was used to build the ABM and Strava and Riderlog data were used to calibrate and validate the model. The model outputs give insights into bicyclist movements through the road network. The incorporated built environment characteristics include the type of bicycling infrastructure, tree canopy, slope, land use mix, and vehicle traffic. These choice factors also allowed the computation of rider levels of comfort and safety on each trip. Potential refinements of the model include additional bicycling behaviour factors (such as aesthetic preferences), and bicyclists' interactions with each other and other modes of transport.                        Developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) as a digital tool to support planning bicycling infrastructure networks.        Extensive literature review of built environment factors affecting bicycling movement.        Developing methods to validate and calibrate ABM using crowdsourced data like STRAVA and Riderlog.        Calibrating the model factors and equations using bicyclists' movement in Sydney's urban context.
Navigating through unstructured environments is a basic capability of intelligent creatures, and thus is of fundamental interest in this research. Navigation is a complex task that relies on developing an internal representation of space, grounded by recognizable landmarks and robust visual processing, that can simultaneously support continuous self-localization (“I am here”) and a representation of the goal (“I am going there”). Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies can make this achievable. The number of robots deployed in the manufacturing industry has increased rapidly and this trend is likely to continue in the future, as autonomous robots have the potential to automate a wide array of labor-intensive tasks in the factory environment and improve output. There are many technical challenges that need to be solved to realize an autonomous multifunctional robotic platform. In this research, we aim to address the primary problem of the autonomous navigation of robots in the factory environment. The robotic platform will be able to recognize the markers on the factory floor and navigate in the factory on the designated path by avoiding obstacles in its path from point A to point B autonomously. In this research, we use a minimal number of sensors to reduce the BOM cost of the robotic platform and maximize battery life. We intend to use cameras (RGB), motor encoders and a low-cost IMU to localize the robot, and an electric drive train to propel the platform. Also, we have used neural networks to recognize the markers and paths in the factory environment, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to localize the robot and a navigation algorithm to guide the robotic platform to the destination.
Implicit finite difference method is popular numerical method for simulation of transient pipeline dynamics, governed by the system of Euler partial differential equations. If advection equation is included in the mathematical formulation, gas composition tracking is also possible. If implicit scheme is used for gas composition tracking, simulated concentration profiles are distorted due to the occurrence of numerical diffusion, a non-physical phenomenon, caused by the 1st order accurate numerical implicit scheme. Intensity of the numerical diffusion can be decreased by use of          -scheme with arbitrarily chosen implicitness. In order to evaluate accuracy of such numerical scheme and adequacy for usage in actual application, numerical model must be evaluated on actual gas pipeline system topology with actual measured boundary conditions and compared to actual measured results. Aim of this paper is to assess whether hydrogen concentration tracking is feasible using such approach considering complex grid topologies. Paper highlights the peculiarities of the proposed          -scheme and finite difference method and its impact on the calculated concentration profile for binary gas mixtures. Non-physical flow reversal issue and its impacts on concentration tracking in looped pipeline system is researched and explained. Simulation results shows high accuracy for simulated values of hydraulic variables compared to the measured values, in some cases fit is perfect. Discrepancy between measured and the simulated values of the pressures at nodes on the main transport route is negligible, while the discrepancy increases with the distance from the main transport routes. The largest discrepancy occurred on the most distant node and was between 1.7006 bar (4.85%) and 1.7119 bar (4.88%), depending on the           value. On the other hand, simulated concentration profile lacks finer details due to the numerical diffusion effects while the simulated concentration profile lags the measured profile, partly by the impacts of the 1st order accurate scheme and partly by effects of non-physical reversed flows. Discrepancy between simulated and measured amplitude of the tracked concentration profile was negligible, while discrepancy due to the time delay of the simulated and measured profile was more expressed and ranged between 2h to 9h. Largest time delay was caused by the non-physical flow reversal.                       Model validation on actual network topology using measured boundary conditions.        Only gas component concentration profiles are affected by implicitness of the numerical scheme.        Simulation with lower implicitness is more accurate than fully implicit model.        Non-physical simulated flow reversal can occur in looped network topology and affect hydrogen concentration profile.
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) are autonomous, infrastructure less and self-configuring networks. MANETs has gained lots of popularity due to on the fly deployment i.e. small network setup time and ability to provide communication in obstreperous terrains. Major challenges in MANETs include routing, energy efficiency, network topology control, security etc. Primary focus in this article is to provide method and algorithm to ensure significant energy savings using re-configurable directional antennas. Significant energy gains can be clinched using directional antenna. Key challenges while using directional antenna are to find destination location, antenna focusing, signal power and distance calculations. Re-configurable directional antenna can ensure significant energy gains if used intelligently. This article provides a brief insight into improved energy savings using re-configurable directional antennas and an associated algorithm.
Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the “internet of insecure things.” A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device.  The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.
A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a set of mobile terminals, which move in different directions with different speeds. MANETs are found very useful in real applications such as time-lacking implementations and indoor environments. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Network (BATMAN) routing protocols, in stairs environment, based on real data from our MANET testbed. We evaluate the performance considering three metrics: throughput, delay and packet loss. We design and implement two experimental scenarios: static stairs scenario and shifting stairs scenario. From our experiments, we show that as the number of hops increases to three or more hops, the performance of the communication decreases. The performance decreases further when the nodes are mobile. However, OLSR shows a better performance than BATMAN.
In case of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) the sensed data which are collected by the ordinary senor nodes will have to be forwarded to the sink node (Base Station) in order to be accessible by the remote users. The location of the sink could significantly affect the energy dissipation and throughput of the network. This paper aims to investigate an optimal location for the sink node in such a way that the sum of distances from all the sensor nodes to the sink node is minimized. In an effort to place the sink node within the network our algorithm finds the geometric median of all the location associated with the sensor nodes. In a discrete set of points, the geometric median could be defined as the location which basically minimizes the sum of distances to all the points. Performance evaluation reveals that the proposed location for the sink node extends the network lifetime comparing with other possible location within the network field.
The piezoresistivity of graphene nanoplatelets elastomeric nanocomposite is investigated by a novel finite element approach.        The incorporation of randomly oriented graphene nanoplatelets led to a lower percolation threshold.        More electrical paths between two electrodes led to a diminished resistivity.        The increased resistance change came from the increased average distances between the platelets upon strain.              Strain sensors have attracted great attentions for practical applications such as human-machine interface. It is challenging to model the electrical behavior of elastomeric strain sensors modified with nanomaterials. This study presents a finite element simulation to explore the piezoresistivity of graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)-filled elastomeric nanocomposites. The percolation network model is employed to determine the critical distance necessary for electrical percolation. The finite element percolation network model uses the Euclidian distance between GNPs distributed inside the representative volume element to calculate the resistivity. The influence of various parameters, including GNP alignment direction, aspect ratio, and volume fraction, on the resistivity changes of the nanocomposite is investigated. Results demonstrate that nearly 20% more tunneling distance is allowed for percolation of nanocomposite with 30% larger aspect ratio GNPs. Findings reveal that as the volume fraction of GNPs increases, the critical distance for the electrical percolation decreases significantly.
Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WANs) have emerged as a promising solution to address the connectivity demands of modern distributed enterprises. However, the effective application of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm in such broad and dynamic environments remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present two novel contributions. First, we design a decentralized control plane for SD-WANs that leverages edge-based network monitoring and overlays’ configuration. Then we present a Reinforcement Learning-based orchestration plane that leverages local information for the enforcement of SD-WAN policies. Since traditional approaches suffer either a lack of scalability due to the problem’s complexity or suboptimal performance due to isolated decision-making, the proposed approach leverages a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework. Our novel cooperative approach is based on per-site agents that exchange a small amount of information to enhance performance while preserving scalability. To validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted an extensive experimental evaluation considering diverse SD-WAN scenarios. Results show that our framework is able to satisfy global network policies for a multi-site SD-WAN with different QoS requirements and cost constraints.
-Interval Routing Scheme (         -IRS) is a compact routing method that allows up to           interval labels to be assigned to an arc; and global          -IRS allows not more than a total of           interval labels in the whole network. A fundamental problem is to characterize the networks that admit          -IRS (or global          -IRS). Many of the problems related to single-shortest-path          -IRS have already been shown to be NP-complete. For all-shortest-path          -IRS, the characterization problem remains open for              . In this paper, we study the time complexity of devising minimal-space all-shortest-path          -IRSs and show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a graph admits an all-shortest-path          -IRS, for every integer              , and so is that of deciding whether a graph admits an all-shortest-path          -strict IRS, for every integer              . These are the first NP-completeness results for all-shortest-path          -IRS where           is a constant and the graph is unweighted. The NP-completeness holds also for the linear case. We also prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether an unweighted graph admits an all-shortest-path IRS with global compactness of at most          , which also holds for the linear and strict cases.
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new paradigm to digital identity management that is built on decentralized technologies and can exist without centralized third-parties for managing the identity data. Within the SSI model, a digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a secure and trusted manner. At present, the existing SSI solutions rely on the Internet connection for carrying out the necessary operations such as messaging and credential verification. However, there are many places the Internet may not be accessible and other means for communication is needed. The objective of this paper is to design a proof-of-concept that would allow for secure, trustworthy, and decentralized peer-to-peer communication without the need for any external networking infrastructure. For this, we investigate a particular case involving DIDComm and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We identify requirements for the architecture and propose an architectural framework that allows two entities to securely communicate and exchange verifiable credentials. Furthermore, we look at a specific use case, namely, how offline access control can be enabled within SSI between two mobile devices. We present and evaluate the implementation of offline access control system based on the proposed architecture. Through this research, and experimentation we can conclude that this approach has the potential to enable a wide range of interesting use cases and can be integrated into existing digital identity wallet solutions to extend the capabilities of offline messaging in a secure and decentralized manner that goes beyond the current models that rely on the Internet connectivity.
This paper introduces the dissemination of Hybrid cost calculated for each route in Emission Aware and SLA Based Routing Mechanism as path attribute for purpose of inter-domain routing operation. This paper then compares the performance of the routing mechanism using this method against performance of the routing methods using other types of transmitted metrics such as energy code.
This research investigates a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) framework that solves the virtual topology problem under the communication delay constraint. An arbitrary optical network has been considered with different distances between the nodes and different link capacities. A traffic matrix is assumed for the optical network at an instance and the corresponding virtual topology design is solved by using the mixed integer linear formulation that includes lightpath routing, wavelength assignment, wavelength continuity, flow routing, and traffic losses.    The numerical optimization results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed MILP formulation and superior network performances, validating the proposed framework for optimal virtual topology designs. Moreover, the proposed framework may alleviate computational time issues related to the network learning process of some heuristic approaches.
Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have recently received a great deal of attention in the scientific and developers communities due to the significant advances of this technology in the wireless communication field. The main reason was that competing WMSN approaches that emerged in the last few years provide mesh capabilities (             ., robustness, scalability, multi-hop mesh routing, or energy efficiency, among others) to conventional WSN-based applications, encouraging researchers and end users to adopt new perspectives and solutions. Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market. Under these circumstances, our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode. Therefore, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming. Both mathematical techniques are applied to obtain the best solution that simultaneously minimizes the aggregate message collision time due to hidden terminals and maximizes the network lifetime. Secondly, we propose the design of a   MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance   (MULTI-HIT) which appropriately exploits the available bandwidth and accomplishes a straightforward coordination between any sender–receiver pair. Finally, the analysis and simulation experiments are presented and their results carefully discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of both proposals in the WMSN arena.                        WMSN approaches offer new perspectives to conventional WSN-based applications.        Among WMSN proposals, the ASES mode guarantees the most relevant mesh capabilities.        ASES has no mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals (HT).        Under ASES rules, we propose an optimization model and a multi-channel time-slotted algorithm to alleviate the HT problem.        An intensive performance evaluation study is discussed to validate our proposals.
Today, there are billions of connected IoT devices and their number continues to grow as they contribute to the digitalization of infrastructures. However, the deployment process of these smart wireless devices when delivered to customer premises is slow and error prone as each of them needs to be provisioned with authentication credentials to access the corporate network. In this paper, we propose HANNA, a human-friendly provisioning and configuration framework for smart devices, that extends the zero-touch paradigm to large IoT deployments by introducing voice assisted configuration in combination with large scale ad-hoc communications to overcome the initial installation effort of IoT deployments. The most prominent role in HANNA is played by the assisting device, which includes a voice assistant capable of correctly understanding a minimum number of keywords required for initial provisioning and configuration of the devices. The device’s role is to interact with the user and ensure that all provisioning details are received. These are then converted into appropriate machine instructions for further use by the mass provisioning mechanism. We provide an example prototype implementation of HANNA and evaluate the performance of the assisting device in the human-to-machine communication phase and the performance of the selected communication technique in the machine-to-machine communication phase. Our results show the potential of existing speech-to-text engines for this application area and also reveal shortcomings with respect to the robustness of the engines in office-like working environments as well as with respect to user’s gender and language proficiency level. Additionally we show that the proposed machine-to-machine provisioning approach is always faster compared to manual provisioning for cases with more than ten devices.
In this paper, we consider routing with compact tables in reliability networks. More precisely, we study interval routing on random graphs                       obtained from a base graph      by independently removing each edge with a failure probability             . We focus on additive stretched routing for     -node random graphs for which the base      is a square mesh and             , that is the percolation model at the critical phase. We show a lower bound of                                       on the number of intervals required per edge for every additive stretch             . On the other side, our experimental results show that the size of the largest biconnected components is                       , and thus that there exists a trivial shortest-path routing scheme using at most                        intervals per edge.    The results are extended to random meshes of higher dimension. We show that, asymptotically almost surely, the number of intervals per edge for a random     -dimensional mesh with      nodes is                                                                                , for every additive stretch              and for every integral dimension
The main advantage of multi-band (MB) networks is to provide more capacity than C-band networks by using other unused bands like the L- and S-bands and, in this way, postpone the announced optical network capacity crunch. However, MB nodes have a more complex structure than C-band nodes, impacting their cost and enhancing their induced physical layer impairments (PLIs). The main goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of several MB node architectures (namely baseline, common-band and compact MB node architectures) on the total network capacity and total network cost-per-bit, using a routing, modulation format, and spectrum assignment (RMSA) network planning tool based on a Monte–Carlo simulation that also incorporates the impact of network PLIs. When the PLIs are neglected, the common-band architecture presents the lowest cost-per-bit compared to the remaining MB architectures, since only lower cost C-band components are used. However, with the PLIs impact, the common-band architecture leads to the lowest total network capacity and highest cost-per-bit due to additional noise coming from all-optical wavelength converters. In particular, the common-band total network capacity is less than half the baseline and compact total network capacities for a blocking probability of 1%, considering the best channel launch power. Also, the common-band cost-per-bit is almost twice the baseline and compact cost-per-bit due to the PLIs-induced degradation.                       Four multiband nodes are compared in terms of cost and capacity in a network scenario.        Common-band node loses the cost advantage in presence of physical layer impairments.        Common-band node capacity is less than half the baseline and compact nodes capacity.        Baseline and compact nodes have similar costs and capacities.
The coating ice of transmission lines will threaten the safety of electric power system seriously. In order to obtain the real-time ice-coating data of the transmission lines in ice disaster accurately, this paper designs a real-time monitoring system applied in transmission lines based on ZigBee technology and mesh topology architectures. This system takes advantage of low power consumption of ZigBee technology, self-organization and self-healing of mesh network, and uses the F-AODVjr(F-Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing) to establish a ZigBee wireless communication mesh network. A simulating demonstration is given in the end with the discussing of the system's feasibility and practicability.
The digital twin is the concept of transcending reality, which is the reverse feedback from the real physical space to the virtual digital space. People hold great prospects for this emerging technology. In order to realize the upgrading of the digital twin industrial chain, it is urgent to introduce more modalities, such as vision, haptics, hearing and smell, into the virtual digital space, which assists physical entities and virtual objects in creating a closer connection. Therefore, perceptual understanding and object recognition have become an urgent hot topic in the digital twin. Existing surface material classification schemes often achieve recognition through machine learning or deep learning in a single modality, ignoring the complementarity between multiple modalities. In order to overcome this dilemma, we propose a multimodal fusion network in our article that combines two modalities, visual and haptic, for surface material recognition. On the one hand, the network makes full use of the potential correlations between multiple modalities to deeply mine the modal semantics and complete the data mapping. On the other hand, the network is extensible and can be used as a universal architecture to include more modalities. Experiments show that the constructed multimodal fusion network can achieve 99.42% classification accuracy while reducing complexity.
This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm to implement Central Routing (CR) as an alternative to the existing approaches to avoid full mesh topology in internal border gateway protocol (iBGP). BGP is a key protocol to exchange routing information within an Autonomous System (AS) and among various ASes. All the routers inside an AS have to be connected in full mesh topology to run iBGP protocol to make discoveries such as the selection of root node and the exchange of information. A full mesh topology becomes cumbersome and hard to manage as a network grows. For large networks alternatives to a full mesh topology are available such as route reflectors and BGP confederation at the cost of increased overheads and the possibility of network inconsistencies. The concept of CR is an alternative solution, where the root node in an AS is responsible for all the control and management operations such as maintaining routing tables and calculating paths. The proposed CR based scheme has been implemented through simulations and the results prove CR to be a successful alternative of route reflectors and BGP confederation.
An all-to-all routing in a graph      is a set of oriented paths of     , with exactly one path for each ordered pair of vertices. The load of an edge under an all-to-all routing      is the number of times it is used (in either direction) by paths of     , and the maximum load of an edge is denoted by                     . The edge-forwarding index                  is the minimum of                      over all possible all-to-all routings     , and the arc-forwarding index                         is defined similarly by taking direction into consideration, where an arc is an ordered pair of adjacent vertices. Denote by                      the minimum number of colours required to colour the paths of      such that any two paths having an edge in common receive distinct colours. The optical index                  is defined to be the minimum of                      over all possible     , and the directed optical index                         is defined similarly by requiring that any two paths having an arc in common receive distinct colours. In this paper we obtain lower and upper bounds on these four invariants for 4-regular circulant graphs with connection set                                            . We give approximation algorithms with performance ratio a small constant for the corresponding forwarding index and routing and wavelength assignment problems for some families of 4-regular circulant graphs.
Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have aroused extensive attentions from academic and wireless communication communities due to their abilities to customize the electromagnetic (EM) characteristics of the propagation channels flexibly and rapidly. Recent advances in theoretical innovations and prototype systems have demonstrated the advantages of RISs in terms of low cost, low power consumption, and easy deployment. Meanwhile, the optically transparent RISs are demanded in some application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a 2-bit metalmesh-based RIS with high optical-transparency. By analyzing the surface current distributions on the element, we employ the metalmesh-grid patterns and metalmesh-stripe patterns on the top and ground layers respectively. The metalmesh patterns can help improve the optical transparency of RISs, while maintaining similar microwave characteristics. The RIS can reach the optical transparency of 79%, and the reflection amplitude is greater than −3.2 ​dB within the operating band. Finally, to verify the capability of the proposed RIS in wavefront controls, the far-field scattering patterns of the RIS with different coding sequences are investigated and the simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical results.
There is a growing interest in implementing artificial intelligence for operations research in the industrial environment. While numerous classic operations research solvers ensure optimal solutions, they often struggle with real-time dynamic objectives and environments, such as dynamic routing problems, which require periodic algorithmic recalibration. To deal with dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential with its capability as a self-learning and optimizing mechanism. However, the real-world applications of reinforcement learning are relatively limited due to lengthy training time and inefficiency in high-dimensional state spaces. In this study, we introduce two methods to enhance reinforcement learning for dynamic routing optimization. The first method involves transferring knowledge from classic operations research solvers to reinforcement learning during training, which accelerates exploration and reduces lengthy training time. The second method uses a state–space decomposer to transform the high-dimensional state space into a low-dimensional latent space, which allows the reinforcement learning agent to learn efficiently in the latent space. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in an industrial application of an automated welding process, where our approach identifies the shortest welding pathway of an industrial robotic arm to weld a set of dynamically changing target nodes, poses and sizes. The suggested method cuts computation time by 25% to 50% compared to classic routing algorithms.       Graphical abstract                                      We present a novel reinforcement learning method for solving dynamic routing problems.        The proposed framework, namely SSD4OR-RL, suits to mixed-integer linear programming.        SSD4OR-RL allows knowledge transfer between classic algorithms and RL agents.        SSD4OR-RL boosts RL in high-dimensional state spaces by decomposing them.        We showcase SSD4OR-RL solving ABB industrial welding robot routing challenges.
In traditional networks special efforts are put to secure the perimeter with firewalls: particular routers that analyze and filter the traffic to separate zones with different levels of trust. In wireless multi-hop networks the perimeter is a concept extremely hard to identify, thus, it is much more effective to enforce control on the nodes that will route more traffic. But traffic filtering and traffic analysis are costly activities for the limited resources of mesh nodes, so a trade-off must be reached limiting the number of nodes that enforce them. This work shows how, using the OLSR protocol, the centrality of groups of nodes with reference to traffic can be estimated with high accuracy independently of the network topology or size. We also show how this approach greatly limits the impact of an attack to the network using a number of firewalls that is only a fraction of the available nodes.                       Traditional firewalling on multi-hop networks has a critical impact on network resources.        Centrality metrics can be used to identify a core of nodes able to enforce filtering/monitoring.        OLSR routing information can be used to efficiently identify this core of nodes without overhead.        We propose a method that scales on realistic network dimension and topologies.        Enforcing firewalling only on this core reduces the impact and stops most unwanted traffic.
We consider the problem of randomly sampling information from a network embedded in two-dimensional space, as characteristic of a physical network. We ask in particular what factor most affects the sampling quality: The distribution of the nodes in the space or the connectivity structure of the links? We hypothesize that, although node distribution is also effective in sampling quality, the link connectivity dominates the sampling quality. Our hypotheses are confirmed via extensive simulations as well as theoretical background on the relationship between eigenvalues of the matrix representing the network and the link connectivity properties. This work has relevance to both the analysis of information dissemination in various networks as well as the engineering of networks to be more efficient and resilient for such.
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are becoming increasingly recognized as a promising solution for delivering broadband internet access, owing to their versatility, rapid deployment capabilities, and self-configuring characteristics. This work focuses on optimizing the gateway placement problem in WMNs taking into account objectives like minimizing the number of gateways, reducing hop count, and minimizing the path delay. We employ Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) to simultaneously optimize these objectives and find an optimal gateway placement. The results demonstrate its superiority over traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in finding better solutions with conflicting objectives. The work provides a practical and effective approach to optimizing broadband access, network design, and gateway placement in WMNs, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technology.
An open-access market design is presented to manage network congestion and optimize network use and value. Open access eliminates the walled-garden approach; instead, it commoditizes communications network capacity while decentralizing access to a transparent wholesale market. It ensures that scarce capacity is put to its best use by providing a platform for efficient trade. The market operates without friction using flow trading. It allows participants to bid persistent piecewise-linear downward-sloping demand curves for portfolios of products, gradually adjusting positions toward targeted needs. Flow trading allows fine granularity of products in time and location, creating complete markets. Liquidity and computational feasibility are maintained despite trading millions of interrelated forward and real-time products. Participants manage risk and adverse price impact through trade-to-target strategies. The market operator clears the market every hour, finding unique prices and quantities that maximize as-bid social welfare. Prices, aggregate quantities, and the slope of the aggregate net demand are public. The market operator observes positions, enabling it to optimize collateral requirements to minimize default risk. Priority pricing is used to manage real-time imbalances. An application of the model is developed for intersatellite wholesale communications with optical (laser-beamed) mesh networks in space, showing several efficiency gains.                         Optimizes network usage  : Allocates capacity efficiently through real-time and forward markets, maximizing its value.         Satellite communications  : Congestion management is crucial due to limited throughput and high fixed costs.         Flow trading  : Enables efficient trade and liquidity management with fine product granularity.         Risk management  : Tools and strategies assist participants in managing risk and capital costs.         Transparent and efficient  : Market provides essential price signals for investment and operation.
Recent advancements in wireless technology have tested Wireless Balloon Networks (WBNs) as an ideal solution for the provision of internet facilities in deprived and challenging areas. A few high profile companies, such as Google, Space Data Inc., etc., have already made news by initiating projects based on high-altitude WBNs in order to provide internet facilities in remote areas. Unfortunately, the technical details have mainly been kept confidential so far. In this paper, we attempt to analyze the percolation properties of large-scale WBNs, considering both homogenous and heterogenous wireless nodes. In order to do so, we modeled a WBN as a large-scale random network where the path-loss models of homogenous and heterogenous WBNs were reduced to GDM (Gilbert's Disk Model) and RGDM (Random Gilbert's Disk Model), respectively. The bounds of the critical density regime were derived for both percolation models. Additionally, this paper implemented an experimental test bed for the WBN percolation model. Consequently, the findings of this research may prove crucial in estimating critical network properties.

The rapid increase of the internet users has resulted in significant growth of the online traffic, hence, putting more demand on the network. This has led to a high prevalence of link failures on the network. Upon failure, a network should be able to return to normal operational status within a considerable amount of time to avoid unavailability. This is done by employing link failure recovery strategies or mechanisms. A desirable recovery mechanism is one that enhances the reliability of the network, maintains low communication latency, and reduces the memory utilization of switching devices. In the common traditional network, it is a challenging task to determine the backup paths since the topology is static. Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture separates the control plane from the data plane, thus enabling dynamic network configuration and programmability. Hence, SDN enables network engineers to create both proactive and reactive backup paths in the network controller. Link failure is considered one of the most current research challenges in computer networks. This review paper analyse and compares the literature on recent SDN link failure recovery strategies. The existing link failure recovery techniques, their challenges, limitations, performance criteria, technologies/tools mostly adopted, and also the outline of how they can be improved is discussed.

As the world is moving towards the “Internet of Things” [1], Internet Protocol enabled Wireless Sensor Network is becoming an important research area. In order to make it possible and to facilitate transmission of IPv6 packets over low powered networks, 6LoWPAN [2,3] has been introduced. In this paper, we study mobility issues and scenarios which may occur in the 6LoWPAN network. We also propose an approach to manage the mobility of nodes efficiently based on received signal strength and link quality. Simple load-balancing technique is also incorporated. The 6LoWPAN based Wireless Sensor Network can be integrated with grid computing establishing a Sensor-Grid which may also be used in various applications.
The grain boundary character distribution strongly affects the properties of polycrystalline materials. Grain boundaries of similar characters form networks, whose topological invariants can be considered as distribution descriptors. Understanding the evolution of such descriptors during severe plastic deformations (SPD) can elucidate the evolution of properties and underpin the design of processing routes for target behaviour. For topological analysis of grain boundary networks, polycrystalline materials are considered here as polyhedral complexes with grain boundaries classified into two types — low-angle and high-angle. Changes of grain boundary types are calculated using sub-grain rotations, which reflects the physical mechanism of microstructure evolution during SPD. A non-physical approach, by direct conversions of low-angle to high-angle boundaries, is also explored as a reference to demonstrate the impact of the physical constraint imposed by rotations. Reported is the discovery of topological phase transitions in the grain boundary networks which might take place during severe plastic deformations of different copper alloys. Depending on the evolution approach, the transitions correspond to zeros of the Euler characteristic, or of the logarithm of the inverse connectivity, of the grain boundary network. The relations between these transitions and the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries, and between the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries and plastic strain obtainable experimentally, provide new perspectives for grain boundary engineering and network design. Determining the dominant evolution mechanism and critical accumulated strain for a given material and processing route requires further experimental studies of triple junction evolution.

This paper underscores the symbiosis between industrial engineering techniques and optical communication technologies, bringing valuable insights to the optimization of traffic routing in communication networks using constructive heuristics. Exploring and realizing the potential of optical fiber networks has received more attention due to the popularity of various network services and the ensuing increase in overall internet traffic. Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) stands out among the technologies designed to increase the functionality of core and urban mesh/ring networks. SDM's primary goal is to significantly increase transmission system bandwidths by effectively using the spatial dimension. The routing of traffic within flex-grid SDM optical networks has been optimized in this paper using two novel heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the solutions presented in previous research from the literature.
Wireless sensor networks is made up of many tiny nodes that has the ability to measure physical phenomena and send the collected measurements to the sink node using multiple-hop protocol with short range transmission. One of the main factors that can be considered to increase the sensor network life is routing protocol. The main goal of routing protocol is to select the most optimal path and make decision of sending the gathering data to the sink node. Inefficient routing protocol leads to more re-transmission of data which consume more energy.Thus, a careful and comprehensive performance analysis of the routing protocols used in any wireless sensor network is required. The main goal of this paper is to study the performance of the RPL protocol under three different MAC protocols named; ContikiMac, CXMAC, NullRDC in terms of end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and power consumption to find the best behaviour of the RPL routing protocol under the MAC protocols effect. The results show that NullRDC is better in terms of latency while the ContikiMac outperforms the others in terms of power consumption.
In this paper we introduce new effective resistances on a given network, associated with a positive value and two weights on the vertex set and investigate under which conditions they determine a distance. We prove that this property is closely related with superharmonicity. Moreover, we analyze the behavior of these distances under the usual network transformations, specially the so-called      transformation. We also compute the effective resistance for an   extended network  ; that is, the network obtained from the former one by joining a new vertex, and then study the effect of the   contraction of this new network  ; that is, we apply a star-mesh transformation with center in the joined vertex.
A new class of applications can now be envisaged with the emergence of both mobile ad hoc computing and ubiquitous computing, which imposes a number of new unsolved challenges. Examples of such applications include automatic car control systems and air traffic control systems. Applications of such kind have real-time constraints and are characterised by being highly mobile and proactive, i.e. able to operate without human intervention. Moreover, this kind of applications requires multiple-source multicasting. However, current approaches mainly focus on offering support for continuous flows in low mobile environments where single-source multicasting is assumed. In this paper, we present the QoSMMANET (  QoS M  anagement in     obile Ad hoc     etworks) framework, which offers QoS support for real-time event systems in highly mobile ad hoc environments. Our approach is validated by a number of experiments carried out in the ns-2 network simulator.               Una nueva clase de aplicaciones ahora puede ser prevista con la aparición tanto de la computación Ad-hoc móvil y la computación ubicua, que impone una serie de nuevos desafíos sin resolver. Ejemplos de tales aplicaciones son sistemas de control automático de automóviles y sistemas de control de tráfico aéreo. Aplicaciones de este tipo tienen restricciones de tiempo real y son caracterizadas por ser altamente móviles y activas, es decir, capaz de operar sin intervención humana. Además, este tipo de aplicaciones requiere una multidifusión con múltiples fuentes. Sin embargo, los enfoques actuales se centran principalmente en ofrecer soporte a flujos continuos en ambientes de baja movilidad donde se asume una multidifusión con una sola fuente. En este artículo, presentamos el QoSMMANET (QoS Management in Mobile Ad hoc Networks) framework, el cual ofrece soporte en calidad de servicio (QoS) para sistemas de eventos en tiempo real en entornos Ad-hoc altamente móviles. Nuestro enfoque ha sido validado por una serie de experimentos llevados a cabo en el simulador de red NS-2.
Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming video traffic will constitute a significant proportion of future Internet traffic. With the availability of WiMAX, a large number of these peers will be ubiquitous and located on WiMAX based mobile nodes across the Internet. This chapter proposed a framework for providing quality of service (QoS) to the overlay P2P network over a WiMAX infrastructure. The work integrates traffic engineering and analytical based approach and has been validated with results from experiments.
Torus network has become increasingly important to multicomputer design because of its many desirable properties including low bandwidth and fixed degree of nodes. Also, torus networks can be partitioned into mesh networks. The multicast pattern, in which one source node sends the same message to multiple destination nodes, is the essential pattern in a wide variety of applications. This paper proposes a multicast routing scheme in 2D torus networks. The proposed scheme is a Tree-based Algorithm which Splits torus Networks into two Equally Meshes, hence it is called TASNEM. TASNEM algorithm is a tree-based technique, in which the router simultaneously sends incoming flits on more than one outgoing channel. It requires at most two start-up times, one for each mesh subnetwork. For each mesh subnetwork, the source node delivers a message to the destination nodes along one main path and different horizontal paths branched from the main path. TASNEM algorithm can achieve high degree of parallelism and low communication latency over a wide range of traffic loads. Performance results of a simulation study on torus networks are discussed to compare TASNEM algorithm with some previous algorithms.
In modern networking scenarios, the transmission of numerous burst packets is a common requirement. In this context, Software Defined Networks (SDNs) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution with a programmable centralized controller for managing complex networks. This article aims to propose a Machine Learning-based Proactive Re-routing Scheme (MLPRS) that aims to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) by dynamic load balancing in real-time network topology. The proposed scheme applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify applications and assign flow priorities based on their type. The betweenness centrality algorithm is used to identify the importance of each link in the network, and the links are ordered in the betweenness set. The proposed method monitors the load on each link and if the critically important links are overloaded, then the flow is routed in real-time to avoid congestion. The idea of MLPRS has been simulated in Mininet with an OpenDaylight controller, and the results show that it effectively improves QoS and network performance. The MLPRS approach contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing intelligent and dynamic load-balancing techniques using machine learning algorithms. The performance of MLPRS has been improved by 3.7 % and 3.6 % in terms of Throughput and Bandwidth respectively when compared with the default SDN.
Indoor photovoltaic cells have the potential to power the Internet of Things ecosystem, including distributed and remote sensors, actuators, and communications devices. As the power required to operate these devices continues to decrease, the type and number of nodes that can now be persistently powered by indoor photovoltaic cells are rapidly growing. This will drive significant growth in the demand for indoor photovoltaics, creating a large alternative market for existing and novel photovoltaic technologies. With the re-emergence of interest in indoor photovoltaic cells, we provide an overview of this burgeoning field focusing on the technical challenges that remain to create energy autonomous sensors at viable price points and to overcome the commercial challenges for individual photovoltaic technologies to accelerate their market adoption.       Context & Scale       The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem promises large networks of connected devices collecting the big data upon which our medical, manufacturing, infrastructure, and energy industries will be monitored and optimized. Billions of wireless sensors are expected to be installed over the coming decade, with almost half to be located inside buildings. Currently, the use of batteries to power these devices places significant constraints on their power consumption, where the range and frequency of data transmission are curtailed to achieve sufficient battery life, and the range of applications is also limited to the ones that allow battery replacement. Additional operation and maintenance costs are also incurred by providing replacement batteries.     Indoor photovoltaics has the potential to solve these hardware issues, providing greater reliability and operational lifetimes in wireless sensor networks. Persistently powering individual nodes by harvesting ambient light using small ∼cm      photovoltaic cells is becoming possible for more and more wireless technologies and devices. Characterizing IPV cells is a growing research field with the performance of a considerable number of different PV technologies having now been measured under ambient light sources. Given the interest in commercializing different photovoltaic cells in this growing market, we discuss here the outstanding research questions that must be answered by the indoor photovoltaic community to enable self-powered, indoor-located IoT nodes.           Indoor photovoltaic cells have the potential to power the Internet of Things ecosystem. As the power required to operate devices continues to decrease, the type and number of nodes that can now be persistently powered by indoor photovoltaic cells are rapidly growing. This will drive significant growth in the demand for indoor photovoltaics, creating a large alternative market for existing and novel photovoltaic technologies. We provide a perspective on this burgeoning field, outlining the technical and commercial challenges to be overcome.

Wi-Fi 7, based on the IEEE 802.11be amendment, is designed to increase the maximum achievable throughput, expand the range of operating frequencies, and improve latency and jitter in worst-case scenario. In the context of the discussions to shape what Wi-Fi 8 will be, the IEEE 802.11 WG is evaluating multi-AP coordination as a strategy to further improve network performance in several aspects. MAC-driven multi-AP coordination strategies include coordinated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (c-OFDMA), coordinated Time Division Multiple Access (c-TDMA), and coordinated Spatial Reuse (c-SR). In c-OFDMA, a set of APs transmit during a Transmission Opportunity on different channels, whereas in c-TDMA, the APs take turns transmitting on the same channel during a Transmission Opportunity. Instead, in c-SR, a set of APs transmit simultaneously on the same channel and during the same Transmission Opportunity.    In this paper, we focus on c-SR. We introduce a c-SR interference model and present a strategy based on the proposed model for estimating groups of APs that can transmit successfully simultaneously. We implemented the proposed approach in the multi-AP coordination framework of ns-3 that we developed to analyze c-TDMA. We then thoroughly evaluate the performance of the proposed c-SR scheme via ns-3 simulations. The proposed scheme allows increasing the system throughput of a dense deployment up to 2.3 times as well as substantially reducing the Head of Line delay.
In this paper, we have presented an efficient RWA protocol for WDM networks. The optimal and sub-optimal lightpaths are found by the ants (control agents) depending upon the number of free wavelengths available, the length of the lightpath (hop count) and number of conversion required from source to destination. When a connection request arrives at a node, the high speed data are routed through the readily available optimal lightpath thereby reducing the processing time. The low speed data are first tried to groom over the existing low speed data, else routed through the readily available lightpath. As opposed to the reactive protocols, our proposed protocol is proactive in the sense that it proactively updates the changes in the network status using the concept of ant colony optimization. Further for survivability backup lightpath is maintained. The selection of backup lightpath is done in such a way that there is no shared link between the primary and backup lightpath but it can be shared with another backup lightpath. By simulation results, we showed that our proposed protocol has low blocking probability and delay.
Broadband internet access through the user equipment has become the hot research topic. The shadowing and multipath issues restrict the high performance nature of 4G cells. In Multi hop Relay (MHR) networks, Relay Stations (RS) are introduced to improve coverage and capacity of the system. There exist some issues like path selection and RSs deployment, which severely affects the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system. In this paper, to improve the QoS of MHR networks, Load Aware Routing Metric (LARM) based path selection and a low complex Burst Profile (BP) based RS deployment schemes are discussed.
In this paper we aim at facilitating the flexible 5G core network architecture with foresighted session management. To achieve this we propose a 5G-native architecture utilizing a three-stage learning approach, which covers the dimensions of interest to manage sessions in a foresighted manner. In this perspective we exploit the 5G concepts of per-user mobility and activity patterns, apply our CODIPAS RL Framework to anticipate the user behavior and network requirements, and utilize the outcome for learning-based network optimization on the session level and transport network stretch utilizing our Learning of Learning approach. We further contribute with a model that exploits the foresighted session management approach by utilizing the prediction of user behavior for optimized intermediate User Plane Function (iUPF) placement.
In this contemporary era, recent developments have seen proliferation of methods on improving energy utilization for wireless sensor networks. Although the proposed methods can mitigate the problem of rapid battery depletion to some extent, the lifespan of sensor nodes is still a biggest constraint. Many studies conducted so far have shown continuous network functions with the help of external harvesting techniques. However, these provide low output because of the limitation on the energy capturing devices. Therefore, energy limitation strongly restricts the usage of wireless sensor nodes. This paper aims to provide high recharging rates and better energy efficiency by proposing a three-step mechanism, which is an extension of our existing proposed work J-ERLB (Joint Energy Replenishment and Load Balancing). In a three-step mechanism, topology selection followed by recharging and load balancing are combined together to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes. Topology selection is performed by implementing J-ERLB on various topologies like ring, star, and cluster. Further, taking advantage of Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) we focus on data collection and high-rate recharging. We have implemented System on Chip (SoC) integrated chip on UAV to achieve goal of perpetual network operations. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed mechanism is tested by comparing its numerical outcomes with existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG (Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering) techniques. The overall throughput for 3SM is doubled in comparison with the existing techniques, whereas the average remaining energy shows 6 times better savings for the proposed solution in comparison to the existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG when varying data rates is applied.
Bluetooth Low Energy is a proper name according to the Bluetooth Core Specification.        it is written capitalized by the Bluetooth Specification.        the same is true for the Mesh Profile (it is written capitalized throughout the Mesh Profile Specification.              Bluetooth was firstly announced in 1998. Originally designed as cable replacement connecting devices in a point-to-point fashion its high penetration arouses interest in its ad-hoc networking potential. This ad-hoc networking potential of Bluetooth is advertised for years - but until recently no actual products were available and less than a handful of real Bluetooth multi-hop network deployments were reported. The turnaround was triggered by the release of the Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Profile which is unquestionable a great achievement but not well suited for all use cases of multi-hop networks. This paper surveys the tremendous work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks during the last 20 years. All aspects are discussed with demands for a real world Bluetooth multi-hop operation in mind. Relationships and side effects of different topics for a real world implementation are explained. This unique focus distinguishes this survey from existing ones. Furthermore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first survey consolidating the work on Bluetooth multi-hop networks for classic Bluetooth technology as well as for Bluetooth Low Energy. Another individual characteristic of this survey is a synopsis of real world Bluetooth multi-hop network deployment efforts. In fact, there are only four reports of a successful establishment of a Bluetooth multi-hop network with more than 30 nodes and only one of them was integrated in a real world application - namely a photovoltaic power plant.
The possibility of seamless handover remains a mirage despite the plethora of existing handover algorithms. The underlying factor responsible for this has been traced to the Handover decision module in the Handover process. Hence, in this paper, the development of novel hybrid artificial intelligent handover decision algorithm has been developed. The developed model is made up of hybrid of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based prediction model and Fuzzy Logic. On accessing the network, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) was acquired over a period of time to form a time series data. The data was then fed to the newly proposed                ahead ANN-based RSS prediction system for estimation of prediction model coefficients. The synaptic weights and adaptive coefficients of the trained ANN was then used to compute the                ahead ANN based RSS prediction model coefficients. The predicted RSS value was later codified as Fuzzy sets and in conjunction with other measured network parameters were fed into the Fuzzy logic controller in order to finalize handover decision process. The performance of the newly developed                ahead ANN based RSS prediction algorithm was evaluated using simulated and real data acquired from available mobile communication networks. Results obtained in both cases shows that the proposed algorithm is capable of predicting ahead the RSS value to about ±0.0002    dB. Also, the cascaded effect of the complete handover decision module was also evaluated. Results obtained show that the newly proposed hybrid approach was able to reduce ping-pong effect associated with other handover techniques.
The growing demand for customized products is challenging companies to change their organizational structure towards a flexible organizational model. However, small and medium sized enterprises (SME) do not have the necessary resources to integrate in their production processes new technologies which could help them facing such challenges. We propose a framework in which an intelligent workpiece carrier (IWC) is introduced in a traditional production line. We propose to integrate the knowledge of production steps in the IWC to make it able to take decisions about the process execution. A first prototype was developed and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Through the implementation, it has been shown that the IWC represents a promising component in the realization of flexible production systems.
LAR1 is a reactive and location based routing protocol used in wireless ad hoc network. It has three packets with the help of which it transfer data from one node to another and maintain connection, they are - route request, route reply and route error packets. This paper is based on using two types of route request packets – modified route request packet (used initially when no information about destination is used) and original route request packet (used when route breakage has taken place). In modified route request packet we have removed redundant fields like zone variable field and flooding variable field. We used well known network simulator QualNet 6.1 from scalable networks to compare original LAR1 and modified LAR1 (MYLAR1). In comparing it is found that performance parameters such as average unicast jitter, average unicast end to end delay, total unicast messages received and unicast received throughput of MYLAR1 is better than original LAR1 routing protocol.
Wireless mesh networks are designed as an economical solution to provide high quality service for last-mile broadband Internet access. The paramount priority of these networks is the throughput maximization which is in conflict with a scarce bandwidth. Multicast is a technology that provides a good trade-off between maximizing the throughput and minimizing the bandwidth usage. This paper quantifies the reliability gain of combining classes for reliable multicast in the wireless mesh network. We define the delay as the performance metric for reliability. We then provide an analytical analysis to study the impact of group size, packet loss rate and depth of the multicast tree on the performance improvement achieved by combining classes. Our numerical results show that combining classes significantly reduces distribution delays, compared to the receiver-initiated class alone. The performance gains increase as the group size, the packet loss rate and the depth of the multicast tree increase, making the classes combination approach more scalable with respect to these parameters.
Wireless network is the communication foundation that supports the intelligentization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm. The topology of UAV communication network is the key to understanding and analyzing the behavior of UAV swarm, thus supporting the further prediction of UAV operations. However, the UAV swarm network topology varies over time due to the high mobility and diversified mission requirements of UAVs. Therefore, it is important but challenging to research dynamic topology inference for tracking the topology changes of the UAV network, especially in non-cooperative manner. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring UAV swarm network topology based on external observations, and propose a dynamic topology inference method. First, we establish a sensing framework for acquiring the communication behavior of the target network over time. Then, we expand the multi-dimensional dynamic Hawkes process to model the communication event sequence in a dynamic wireless network. Finally, combining the sliding time window mechanism, the maximum weighted likelihood estimation is applied to inferring the network topology. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are based on constrained devices. Energy conservation is one of the main constraints, and the traditional IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (IPv6-NDP) was neither designed nor suitable to cope with it. This inefficiency arises from non-transitive wireless links and heavy multicast transmission, sometimes rendering it impractical in LLNs. Substantial work has been done by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to optimize the IPv6-ND protocol, known as IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network - Neighbor Discovery Protocol (6LoWPAN-NDP). Despite these improvements, full implementation is yet to be achieved in commercial, open-source, or proprietary sectors. In this article, we debate both Neighbor Discovery Protocols (NDPs), examining various aspects. We implemented 6LoWPAN-NDP in a well-known ns3 simulator. We discuss the complexity of 6LoWPAN-NDP and see why open-source, commercial, or proprietary sectors have not widely adopted it. We present how both protocols function optimally in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios. We present results and analysis of both NDPs control messages’ behavior. At the same time, data traffic is turned on and off, and we demonstrate the operational behavior of Link-local Unicast Address (LUA) and Global Unicast Address (GUA) in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios. The presented implementation can be helpful in enabling large-scale simulations and evaluating scenario-specific protocol parameters, along with protocol extensions.       Graphical abstract                                      6LoWPAN-NDP is the optimized Neighbor Discovery Protocol for LLNs, e.g., IoT systems.        6LoWPAN-NDP is not broadly adopted and is difficult to find in simulation systems.        We do explore its strengths and weaknesses, and if its adoption should be fostered.
As modern vehicles are capable to connect to an external infrastructure and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies mature, the necessity to secure communications becomes apparent. There is a very real risk that today's vehicles are subjected to cyber-attacks that target vehicular communications. This paper proposes a three-layer framework (sensing, communication and control) through which automotive security threats can be better understood. The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides the state-of-the-art review on attacks and threats relevant to the communication layer and presents countermeasures.
The Channel assignment in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) has to be optimal to maintain connectivity and to increase the aggregate network bandwidth. Based on the expected load on each virtual link, the channel assignment strategy assigns channels to the multi radio network interfaces. In this paper, we propose a centralized rank based channel assignment algorithm. The traffic aware metric (WCETT) is used in routing protocol to provide the quality of service (QoS). The proposed centralized rank based channel assignment scheme is based on a rank function. The rank of each node is computed based on the aggregate traffic, weighted cumulative expected transmission time (WCETT) from the gateway, and the number of NICs per node. The proposed channel assignment algorithm can improve the network throughput and utilization of channel to a large extent. The results in the simulator (NS2) show that the proposed algorithm attains the high network throughput and utilization of channels.
Technology is continually undergoing a constituent development caused by the appearance of billions new interconnected “things” and their entrenchment in our daily lives. One of the underlying versatile technologies, namely wearables, is able to capture rich contextual information produced by such devices and use it to deliver a legitimately personalized experience. The main aim of this paper is to shed light on the history of wearable devices and provide a state-of-the-art review on the wearable market. Moreover, the paper provides an extensive and diverse classification of wearables, based on various factors, a discussion on wireless communication technologies, architectures, data processing aspects, and market status, as well as a variety of other actual information on wearable technology. Finally, the survey highlights the critical challenges and existing/future solutions.
GPS-based probe car data is useful for studying traffic situations that roadside sensors cannot detect. However, the ambiguity in the map-matching and route identification processing of link-based probe data analysis has been a difficult problem especially in urban areas with many high-density roads and elevated roads. Unlike situations in which navigation systems are to be developed, in offline analysis, there are cases where a real-time constraint is not imposed. This means we can refer to data from any time of day of a vehicle tour and use much more computer resources than would be available for real-time embedded systems. In this paper, a new method of map-matching and the route identification based on dynamic programming is proposed and its effectiveness is shown in comprehensive field data tests.
Flow-guided electromagnetic nanonetworks hold tremendous potential for transformative medical applications, enabling monitoring, information gathering, and data transmission within the human body. Operating in challenging environments with stringent computational and power constraints within human vascular systems, these nanonetworks face significant hurdles. Successful transmissions between in-body nanonodes and on-body nanorouters are infrequent, requiring novel approaches to enhance network throughput under such circumstances. Traditional flow-guided nanonetworks rely on nanonodes to transmit packets if they possess sufficient energy, irrespective of their proximity to the nanorouter. In this paper, we present an extended model for legacy flow-guided nanonetworks that offers substantial throughput improvements while reducing the required number of nanonodes compared to the baseline blind transmission approach. By allocating transmission energy to allow more than one transmission during a charging cycle, our proposed model significantly enhances network throughput, facilitating the deployment of nanocommunication-supported medical applications. For example, with only two transmissions, it is possible to increase throughput by around 46% with the same number of nanonodes or, equivalently, reduce the number of nanonodes by the same amount to achieve the same throughput.       Graphical abstract                                      Transmission power allocation in flow-guided nanonetworks increases transmission throughput.        Transmission power allocation in flow-guided nanonetworks allows the definition of enhanced nanomedical applications.        Legacy flow-guided nanocommunication networks performance gets significantly improved through transmission power allocation.
A number of network technologies applicable to home networking have emerged for various purposes in recent decades. Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 WLAN provide the home network backbone, along with a range of competing technologies for sensors and home automation such as IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth LE. Technologies in the home vary with respect to their importance. In this paper, we provide a model smart home network and analyze its graph-theoretic properties with an emphasis on the resilience of critical services and connections to the Global Internet. We consider both the network connectivity graph of nodes and links, and our novel   technology interdependence graph.  We explore the resilience of the network technologies in the smart home in light of complex technological interdependency. We analyze these graphs and discuss properties such as diameter, closeness, centrality, and k-connectedness. We explain why this analysis is a necessary pre-condition for understanding IoT-based smart-city resilience.
Conventional Al    Si materials always have a coarse and discontinuous Si structure, which limits their application as thermal management materials. Fortunately, nature has evolved efficient strategies to form complex microstructures that exhibit excellent wear resistance and thermal properties; one such example is found in the red deer antler. Here, inspired by the antler structure, Al    Si composites with a novel fenestrated network-particle structure (F    N) and with a common isolated island structure (I    I) are designed and prepared. Subsequently, the dynamic formation of F    N is tracked and studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. To investigate the reinforcement mechanisms of F    N, the wear resistances and thermal properties of F    N and I    I are compared and analyzed. Simulation and experimental results show that the reconstruction of a semi-continuous structure promotes the formation of a striated structure, whereas flowing Si particles provide some sites for the formation of the fenestrated structure. The dynamic formation of F    N is strongly influenced by the convection–diffusion process and the flow path. Moreover, this biomimetic F    N structure exhibits better wear resistance and thermal properties than I    I, owing to its strong structural support and high expansion resistance. This work is expected to provide new perspectives on the microstructural design of thermal management materials with good wear resistance.       Graphical abstract             Image 1                                Inspired by antler, an Al    Si composite with a novel fenestrated network-particle structure (F    N) is designed and prepared.         This biomimetic F    N contains three regions: the semi-continuous region, the fenestrated region, and the striated region.         Dynamic reconstruction of F    N is strongly influenced by convection diffusion and flow path.         The Al    50Si material with F    N shows good wear resistance, thermal properties, and structural continuity.
Tactile Internet refers to a network that enables real-time, high-reliability haptic communication and control between humans, machines, and objects over the Internet. Tactile Internet applications include the remote control of drones, cars or industrial tele-operation. In this context, the Multi-connection Tactile Internet Protocol (MTIP) is a novel multipath transport protocol designed to support the requirements of Tactile Internet applications in large, private mobile networks. The objective of this paper is to analyze and verify the correctness and performance of the MTIP protocol to ensure that the protocol functions correctly under different network scenarios and it is ready to meet the performance requirements of Tactile Internet applications. For that purpose, a two-step approach is employed to analyze and verify MTIP. In the first step, a formal model of MTIP is developed using timed automata and the      tool is utilized to verify correctness properties represented as temporal formulas. In the second step, the performance of the protocol is analyzed using the statistical model checking features of             ) in scenarios that are difficult and expensive to reproduce in a real network. The results indicate that MTIP’s model meets the specified temporal properties, and the performance evaluation showcases the potential and trade-off of using multiple paths to enhance the communication. Based on the analysis and verification results, the paper emphasizes the readiness of MTIP for real-world deployment and highlights its potential benefits for enhancing the performance of Tactile Internet applications.                        Modeling the MTIP protocol with              Formal verification of the correctness of MTIP with                   Statistical Model Checking (    ) to analyze the performance of MTIP.
Machine learning has received increasing attention in computer science in recent years and many types of methods have been proposed. In computer networks, little attention has been paid to the use of ML for fault detection, the main reason being the lack of datasets. This is motivated by the reluctance of network operators to share data about their infrastructure and network failures. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap using anomaly detection techniques to discern hardware failure events in wireless community networks. For this purpose we use 4 unsupervised machine learning, ML, approaches based on different principles. We have built a dataset from a production wireless community network, gathering traffic and non-traffic features, e.g. CPU and memory. For the numerical analysis we investigated the ability of the different ML approaches to detect an unprovoked gateway failure that occurred during data collection. Our numerical results show that all the tested approaches improve to detect the gateway failure when non-traffic features are also considered. We see that, when properly tuned, all ML methods are effective to detect the failure. Nonetheless, using decision boundaries and other analysis techniques we observe significant different behavior among the ML methods.
In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization technique for improving the QoS of video streaming applications in multi-radio Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) using Multiple Description Coding (MDC). WMN is an emerging technology which is used to connect various types of networks to the internet. As the trafficdensity is very high fromthe client mesh to the gateways, load balancing in these networks has become an important research issue. Thus, there is a need for multipath routing which can exploit the multi-radio capabilities along with the load balancing mechanism. Furthermore, the dynamic and shared nature of wireless medium makes the task of supporting QoS for video streaming applications challenging. Towards this,MDCis an effective technique for the video transmission over the unpredictable routes because of varying channel conditions.In this work,we compute multiple paths using Passive Interference andDelay Aware (PIDA) metric and performload balancing using MDC. Proposed work is implemented in Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing protocol using NS2 simulator. The results reveal that proposed technique withMDCperforms better in terms of PSNR, frame delay and frame loss compared to existing technique
Smart Grid Network (SGN) has recently received a great deal of attention and attracted a considerable amount of research. In fact, (SGN) becomes an alternative source of power since it provides efficiency and reliability power consumption. Thus, SG architecture includes several communication schemes to ensure the best transmission of power and satisfy the consumer’s requirement. To reach these ambitions, the transmission must be established at time and without error. In the traditional transmission, every consumer transmits the power demand using a TDMA mechanism which prolongs the delay. In this paper, the purpose is to suggest a model that can quickly transmit the power demand and achieve a good performance in terms of delay. The scheme is called Cooperative Wireless Transmission for Smart Neighbor Area Network (CWT). The cooperative means that all consumers can participate and coordinate between them to transmit the total power. So, the first purpose is to gather the total power of all consumers simultaneously and rapidly by employing QPSK modulation so that to improve the throughput, the second one is to evaluate the performance of CWT in terms of Cooperative Symbol Error Rate (CSER) and Estimated Power (EP). All results are presented using numerical simulations
Graphical abstract                                       The dense feature adaptive connection module improves the quality of depth map.        The distributed 3D convolution reduces the computational cost and memory space.        The joint loss function makes the network sensitive to small depth structures.               The goal of Multi-View Stereo is to reconstruct the 3D point cloud model from multiple views. With the development of deep learning, more and more learning-based research has achieved remarkable results. However, existing methods ignore the fine-grained features of the bottom layer, which leads to the poor quality of model reconstruction, especially in terms of completeness. Besides, current methods still rely on a large amount of consumed memory resources because of the application of 3D convolution. To this end, this paper proposes a Multiple Granularities Feature Fusion Network for Multi-View Stereo, an end-to-end depth estimation network combining global and local features, which is characterized by fine-granularity multi-feature fusion. Firstly, we propose a dense feature adaptive connection module, which can adaptively fuse the global and local features in the scene, provide a more complete and effective feature map for inferring a more detailed depth map, and make the ultimate model more complete. Secondly, in order to further improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed point cloud, we introduce normal and edge loss futead of only using depth loss functions as in the existing methods, which makes the network more sensitive to small depth structures. Finally, we propose distributed 3D convolution instead of traditional 3D convolution, which reduces memory consumption. The experimental results on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed method in this papaer achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which proves the accuracy and effectiveness of the MG-MVSNet proposed in this paper.
The survivability of WDM networks is discussed in this paper. A p-cycle and p-path dynamic hybrid protection strategy based on block probability is developed. Some valuable and significant results are achieved by comparing this dynamic hybrid protection strategy with a pure p-cycle protection scheme as regards redundancy of network resource. By this strategy the protected links and the pre-configured time of the p-cycle and p-path can be determined according to the block probability which can indicate the network behaviors, so the requirement of real-time pre-configuring can be met. It is shown by simulation that the optimal proportion p-cycle and p-path dynamic hybrid protection strategy has higher resource utilization ratio and lower resource redundancy than the pure p-cycle protection strategy in the case of 35% block probability threshold and smaller than 400 pre-configured structure number.
Modern network services are in most cases virtualized and the traffic of various users is multiplexed over the same physical links. Traditional network monitoring methods which predominantly rely on the physical interface monitoring are not sufficient because they do not provide the insight into the behaviour of the traffic in the specific network service instance or per-user service experience. This paper presents NetMon, a framework that gathers performance indicators inside the network service and at the same time allows an efficient spatial performance degradation localization capability. NetMon is technology agnostic and suitable for various network technologies ranging from legacy to the new type of services based on network function virtualization, chaining service functions or programmable network elements. The paper presents an original solution to the problem of scalable active network service monitoring with the capability to distinguish the measurements of different virtual networks. The proposed hybrid monitoring method which mixes the active probing and capturing this probe traffic provides a good trade-off between the granularity of the results and the traffic overhead created by the monitoring system itself. The system was tested in the pan-European GEANT network which connects European research and education infrastructures and showed reliable performance over long periods of time.

Now days the number of users that use data networks has increased tremendously and this demand will keep on increasing. This has made an increase of bandwidth necessary. Our current data networks are unable to support this growth, so better solution is to use optical data networks, in which the bandwidth is over 50Tbps. Data network provides also provides a huge bandwidth but the maximum speed for an end user is only a few Gbps which is speed of their devices. So if we use wavelength division multiplexing, maximum bandwidth utilization will be done because of simultaneous transmission of data. Traffic grooming problem is a NP-hard problem, so we need to use metaheuristics. DEPT and MOVNS have been proved to provide most optimal solutions. But these were implemented earlier on full grooming network. This paper proposes variants of DEPT and MOVNS using sparse grooming network which will provide better results in terms of throughput and propagation delay.
One of the main challenges in Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN) is the delay caused by shared and nondeterministic behavior of wireless communication medium. The Retry-Limit parameter of IEEE 802.11 standard can be used to control packet reliability, whereas other parameters mostly effect on the packet delay. In this paper, at first the delay-reliability trade-off in WSANs based on MIMO-Enabled IEEE 802.11 standard, utilizing Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) at Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and Maximum Likelihood Spatial Multiplexing at PHYsical (PHY) Layer is studied. Then two simple adaptive schemes have been proposed to minimize packet delay while satisfying the required reliability at noisy factory environment.
Mesh tracks on peatlands are often granted permits on a temporary basis under the presumption that the tracks are either removed at the end of their permitted use or remain unused in situ. However, the fragility of peatland habitats and poor resilience of the specialist plant communities within them, mean that these linear disturbances may persist post-abandonment or post-removal. We removed sections of mesh track, abandoned five years earlier, from a blanket peatland using two different removal treatment methods (mown and unprepared) and studied a third treatment with sections left in place over a period of 19 months. On abandoned tracks, invasive species including   Campylopus introflexus    Deschampsia flexulosa   had established, while track removal led to extensive loss of      species. Loss of surficial nanotopographic vegetation structures during track removal was extensive, and micro-erosion features were prevalent in both removal treatments. Abandoned sections of track performed comparably better across all metrics than removed sections. However, similarity between the vegetation assemblage of the abandoned track and the controls was <40% at the study outset, with NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) highlighting divergences. There was a mean species loss of 5 per quadrat for the removed sections. Bare peat was present in 52% of all track quadrats by the finish of the study. Our findings suggest that mesh tracks left in situ and track removal both present significant barriers to recovery and additional conservation interventions may be required after peatland tracks are abandoned.                        Access tracks both surfaced and unsurfaced are a growing problem in peatlands globally.        Temporary tracks are designed to attenuate negative impacts of vehicular passage over peatlands.        We studied changes in the vegetation community after a temporary track is removed.        Track abandonment and removal both led to significant alterations to the vegetation.        Removal led to extensive bare peat areas which are vulnerable to erosion.
Sensor Nodes (SNs) in Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) continuously monitor the environment and accumulate data. But due to the limited memory and processing capabilities of the sensor nodes, the data must be transmitted to the central server for further analysis. To do this, routing via multi-hop channel is used which consumes a lot of particular SN's energy and also utilizes the resources, including the battery and memory of all the SN's involved in routing. This process drains the SN's energy rapidly and further leading to disconnection from the central server. To address this issue, mobile sink concept is introduced. The mobile sink collects the data from the SN's and hands it over to the central server which reduces the SN's involvement in data transmitting, but this process involves computationally complex tasks. In this context, we use linear programming to find the best visiting order to collect the information from a set of prioritized SN's, where other nodes transmit their data to them. We confirm that this process is computationally lightweight. In addition, this approach meat the performance criteria such as the lifespan of WSNs, the usage of buffer, throughput, and delay. We simulate the proposed model using Python, and they show improvement in efficiency when tested with different metrics of WSNs.
Hypercube is a popular interconnection network. Due to the popularity of hypercube, more researchers pay a great effort to develop the different variants of hypercube. In this paper, we have proposed a variant of hypercube which is called as “Connected Cubic Network Graphs”, and have investigated the Hamilton-like properties of Connected Cubic Network Graphs (CCNG). Firstly, we defined CCNG and showed the characteristic analyses of CCNG. Then, we showed that the CCNG has the properties of Hamilton graph, and can be labeled using a Gray coding based recursive algorithm. Finally, we gave the comparison results, a routing algorithm and a bitonic sort algorithm for CCNG. In case of sparsity and cost, CCNG is better than Hypercube.
The IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) standard defines a set of QoS sensitive mechanisms for regulating the access to Broadband Wireless networks. In this paper we present a formal quantitative verification study of different Traffic Shaping (TS) solutions as proposed in the literature. In particular we consider a      TS (TS-pri) and a      TS (TS-prob) and we compare them by means of probabilistic model checking verification. In this way the performance tradeoffs between      (i.e. TS-pri) and      (i.e. TS-prob) can be formally quantified and the desired configuration of the TS mechanism can be chosen accordingly.
Fiber wireless (FiWi) access network is one of the broad band access networks used to support multimedia applications and interactive services. However minimum QoS needs to be maintained by the network. In this paper a method has been proposed to compute the various network parameters such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), average delay and network throughput for a FiWi network, to ensure minimum QoS. This approach may be proved very useful in computing these parameters comprehensively for any algorithm related with research issues of FiWi network like ONU placement, survivability, energy efficient algorithms etc.
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to enable Industry 4.0 through the extensive deployment of low-power devices. However, industrial applications require, most of the time, high reliability close to 100% and low end-to-end delays. This corresponds to very challenging objectives in wireless (lossy) environments. This delay can be disastrous in time-sensitive industrial IoT deployments where immediate detection and actions impact security, safety, and machine failures. With an efficient MAC protocol, data will be provided quickly to enable the IoT to be fully effective for mission-critical applications. Efficient medium sharing is even more difficult in IIoT due to ultra-low latency, high reliability, and high quality of service (QoS) compared to best-effort for IoT. This article does not survey all existing MAC protocols for IoTs, which was already done in other works. The goal of this paper is to analyze existing MAC protocols that are more suitable for IIoT.
Hidden and exposed terminal problems are known to negatively impact wireless communications, degrading potential computing services on top. These effects are more significant in Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs), and, particularly, in those based on the IEEE 802.15.5 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN mesh) standard, a promising solution for enabling low-power WMSNs. The first contribution of this paper is a quantitative evaluation of these problems under the IEEE 802.15.5 Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode, which is intended for asynchronous data-collection applications. The results obtained show a sharp deterioration of the network performance. Therefore, this paper also reviews the most relevant approaches that cope with these problems and are compatible with ASES. Finally, a set of these proposals is assessed to find out those more suitable for their potential integration with ASES, which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper.                       The hidden and exposed effects are assessed on Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs).        Performance evaluation reveals a clear negative impact on WMSNs.        Different scientific proposals are discussed in order to mitigate these problems.        Some of these proposals are stressed and compared according to WMSN premises.        Best solutions of our comparative study are shown to the audience.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative multi-task system has become the research focus in recent years. However, the existing network frameworks of UAVs are not flexible and efficient enough to deal with the complex multi-task scheduling, because they are not able to perceive the different features. In this paper, a novel cooperated UAVs network framework for multi-task scheduling is proposed. It is a three-layer network including a core layer, an aggregation layer and an execution layer, which enhances the efficiency of multi-task distribution, aggregation and transmission. Furthermore, an AggreGate Flow (AGFlow) based scheduler is dedicatedly designed to maximize the task completion rate, whose key point is to aggregate flows belonging to one task during the multi-task transmission of UAVs network and to allocate priority by calculating the urgency-level of each AGFlow. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with that of state-of-the-art scheduler, the average task completion rate of AGFlow based scheduler is raised by 0.278.
In this paper, we introduce a brand new analytical perspective for analyzing and evaluating the IEEE 802.11-based networks. We identify a tightly-coupled relationship between the number of contending nodes and their contention window sizes in the networks. Based on the relationship, we propose a   downsizing model   for reducing the computational complexity and for improving the simulation performance in the evaluation of the IEEE 802.11-based networks. We first formally prove that the proposed model preserves the operational characteristics of the original networks in their downsized networks through well-known analytical frameworks, such as the models proposed by Bianchi (2000)      , Calí et al. (2000)      , and Hu et al. (2006)      . We then demonstrate that the proposed model speeds up the simulation by maximally   two orders of magnitude  . Even though the simulation shows some difference between the results from an original network and those in its corresponding downsized networks in a wide range of network sizes and traffic patterns, the difference is acceptable since it has minimal values of 1% in most cases and maximum values of 10% in a very few cases. We also present the effectiveness of both the downsizing model and the downsizing-model-based simulation in comparison with other performance models and simulation techniques. As the size and complexity of wireless networks are increasing nowadays, we vision that the new proposed model will be of great advantage in conducting fast and accurate packet-level wireless simulations, as well as being a helpful tool for performing the numerically tractable theoretical studies for extensive performance evaluations, such as determining the network-wide throughput or end-to-end delays.
In a wireless sensor network, range-free localization with a moving beacon can reduce susceptibility to communication noises while concomitantly eliminate need for large number of expensive anchor nodes that are vulnerable to malicious attacks. This paper presents a moving beacon aided range-free localization technique, which is capable of estimating the location of a sensor with high accuracy. A novel distributed localization scheme is designed to optimally determine beacon movement strategy according to user demand. Superiority of this scheme to the state-of-the-art has been established in terms of location estimation quality, measured by the theoretical expected maximum error and simulated mean error while optimizing the beacon location density or traversal path length.
The design and analysis of fault tolerant message routing schemes for large parallel systems has been the focus of much recent research. In this paper, we present a framework for the analysis of routing schemes in distributed memory multiprocessor systems containing faulty or unusable components. We introduce techniques for the derivation of the probabilities of succesfully routing a single message using minimal path routing schemes. Using this framework, we derive closed form solutions for a wide range of routing schemes on the hypercube and on the two- dimensional mesh. The results obtained show the surprising resilience of the hypercube to a potentially large number of faults while demonstrating the inability of the mesh to tolerate a comparatively smaller number of faults.
We designed and implemented the ECA (Event Condition Action) based Multicast Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (ECA-MAODV) routing protocol for the ubiquitous network. The ECA-MADOV protocol plays a predominant role in selecting an efficient route for the creation of an efficient multicast tree and selecting a unique group leader in the multicast group to share and exchange information among group members in an efficient way using a Computational Intelligence (CI) approach. The vague set is a CI that is an enhanced fragment of a fuzzy set. Each element in the Fuzzy set is mapped to [0,1], reflecting its membership grade. We estimated ECA-MAODV’s time and spatial complexity. Besides, we assessed ECA-MAODV performance and compared it with conventional routing protocols such as MAODV and AODV. Finally, simulation results indicate that the ECA scheme proposed is both effective and powerful.
The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions.
In wireless systems, the communication mechanism combines features of broadcast, synchrony, and asynchrony. We develop an operational semantics for a calculus of wireless systems. We present a Reduction Semantics and a Labelled Transition Semantics and prove a correspondence result between them. We first consider a core calculus, essentially with only the primitives for communication, and then a few extensions.   A major goal of the semantics is to describe the forms of interferences among the activities of processes that are peculiar of wireless systems. Such interferences occur when a location is simultaneously reached by two transmissions.
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a promising technology which can offer high speed voice, video and data services upto the requirements at the customer's end. The objectives of this paper is the Performance evaluation of a WiMAX system under various diversity schemes (Selection combining, Maximal ratio combining and Equal gain combining), employing different adaptive transmission policies, such as Optimal power and rate adaptation policy, Optimal rate adaptation with constant transmit power policy, Channel inversion with fixed rate policy, and Truncated channel inversion policy, subjected to co-channel interference. The WiMAX system incorporates OFDM with BPSK modulation as the transmission scheme. Simulated results of the estimated spectrum efficiency shows that the implementation of Optimal power and rate adaptation policy is highly effective to combat co-channel interference in the WiMAX communication system, under Selection combining.
Solutions for monitoring and control of the digital technologies in the residential and tertiary sector are lagging in terms of data exchange and easy deployment. The question arises whether current technologies allow cross-functional integration of data. This paper explores an IoT (Internet of Things) solution in controlling the HVAC system and monitoring of environmental, electric and comfort parameters in a real building. The implemented IoT solution proved to be flexible in terms of data exchange, deployment and debugging time in small and medium-size buildings and thus the IoT integration-based approach to be more efficient. This approach opens new possibilities for a wider set of beneficiaries. As future research, we are considering both extending our solution to other buildings within the university campus premises and on developing predictive analytics services.

A deployed local cloud solution which offers storage capacity for data and also provides a self-managed observability stack tailored for enterprises.
Stereo matching of satellite images presents challenges due to missing data, domain differences, and imperfect rectification. To address these issues, we propose cascaded recurrent networks with masked representation learning for high-resolution satellite stereo images, consisting of feature extraction and cascaded recurrent modules. First, we develop the correlation computation in the cascaded recurrent module to search for results on the epipolar line and adjacent areas, mitigating the impacts of erroneous rectification. Second, we use a training strategy based on masked representation learning to handle missing data and different domain attributes, enhancing data utilization and feature representation. Our training strategy includes two stages: (1) image reconstruction stage. We feed masked left or right images to the feature extraction module and adopt a reconstruction decoder to reconstruct the original images as a pre-training process, obtaining a pre-trained feature extraction module; (2) the stereo matching stage. We lock the parameters of the feature extraction module and employ stereo image pairs to train the cascaded recurrent module to get the final model. We implement the cascaded recurrent networks with two well-known feature extraction modules (CNN-based Restormer or Transformer-based ViT) to prove the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results on the US3D and WHU-Stereo datasets show that: (1) Our training strategy can be used for CNN-based and Transformer-based methods on the remote sensing datasets with limited data to improve performance, outperforming the second-best network HMSM-Net by approximately 0.54% and 1.95% in terms of the percentage of the 3-px error on the WHU-Stereo and US3D datasets, respectively; (2) Our correlation manner can handle imperfect rectification, reducing the error rate by 8.9% on the random shift test; (3) Our method can predict high-quality disparity maps and achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing the percentage of the 3-px error to 12.87% and 7.01% on the WHU-Stereo and US3D datasets, respectively. The source codes are released at
In the digital transformation era, and particularly in Industry 5.0, humans play an active role in industrial cyber–physical systems (CPS) since they are the most flexible piece in such automated systems. However, their integration is not easy and constitutes a relevant challenge, presenting different requirements according to the activities they execute and the related integration levels, i.e., Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) and Human-in-the-Mesh (HitM). Besides the use of human-centric design approaches, the use of digital technologies, namely Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and collaborative robotics, can contribute to empower humans to perform their operations in a faster and more efficient manner. This paper discusses how emergent digital technologies can enhance a more symbiotic integration of humans in industrial CPS, contributing with the analysis of different aspects and concerns that must be considered to properly enable the HitL and HitM integration levels in CPS. Four experimental case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of using digital technologies to enhance the human-CPS integration, covering HitL and HitM levels. Furthermore, some challenges related to the human-integration factors affected by the digital technologies in such environments are briefly discussed and pointed out as research directions.                       Discuss how digital technologies can contribute to integrating humans in industrial cyber–physical systems in the context of Industry 5.0.        Four experimental examples demonstrate the feasibility of using digital technologies to empower human activities.        Discussion of the challenges for adopting digital technologies to enhance the human-CPS integration.
On-body communication technology development requires a better knowledge of antenna radiation and wave propagation along the body, in both near and far fields. Therefore, Green's functions associated with penetrable cylinders are briefly reviewed, considering frequencies at which the body is not much larger than the wavelength and with a particular attention given to the near fields. A unified approach based on current sheets is provided and an acceleration technique is proposed. This is validated with the help of an FDTD software, which also allows the analysis of non-canonical cross-sections. The properties of creeping waves launched by sources parallel and perpendicular to the body are studied, in particular from the point of view of their phase velocity, and a very simple fitting model is proposed. It is also explained how the Green function can be exploited to analyze antennas very efficiently with the help of an integral-equation approach.               La technologie de communication corporelle nécessite une meilleure connaissance du rayonnement des antennes et de la propagation le long du corps humain, tant en champs proches qu'en champs lointains. Par conséquent, les fonctions de Green associées aux cylindres pénétrables sont brièvement revues pour des fréquences où le corps n'est pas beaucoup plus grand que la longueur d'onde, avec une attention particulière portée aux champs proches. Une approche unifiée, fondée sur des nappes de courant, est adoptée, et une technique d'accélération est proposée. Ceci est validé à l'aide d'un logiciel FDTD, qui permet aussi l'analyse de sections non canoniques. Les propriétés des ondes rampantes excitées par des sources parallèles et perpendiculaires au corps sont étudiées : en particulier, leur vitesse de phase. Un modèle d'interpolation très simple est proposé. Nous expliquons également comment les antennes en présence du corps peuvent être analysées en exploitant les fonctions de Green via la résolution d'équations intégrales.
The age span of elder people is increasing and this trend may continue in near future. Elder people wish to stay as independently as possible and are keen on fulfilling lives, but self-regulating ways of life involve with risks, such as weakening, memory loss or impaired judgment and falling that limit mobility. In particular, the daily home activity involving basic functions like preparing breakfast or food, showering, walking, sleeping, watching television, reading books etc., is a key indicator in determining the performance of elder home activity. A intelligent, robust, less cost, flexible and real time home monitoring system has been developed to record the basic home activities and respond immediately when there is a change in the regular daily activity of the elder person. This paper will report our recent works based on trial work of the system to determine the behaviour of elderly person activity.
Grid computing has migrated from traditional high performance and distributed computing to pervasive and utility computing based on the advanced capabilities of the wireless networks and the lightweight, thin devices. This has as result the emergence of a new computing paradigm which is the Mobile Grid. This paper presents the simulation results in order to choose the best routing protocol to give the highest performance when implement the routing protocols in the target mobile grid application. This simulation gives the results for three ad hoc routing protocols named DSDV, DSR and AODV. In this paper these results are shown or simulated by Network Simulator (NS 2.34).The simulations have shown that the conventional routing protocols like DSR have a dramatic decrease in performance when mobility is high. However the AODV and DSDV are perform very well when mobility is high.
For sharing information between nodes in directional ad hoc networks with all-to-all broadcast scheme, the network needs an efficient solution. To enhance the transmission distance and suppress the interference in directional ad hoc networks, multi-beam adaptive array (MBAA) is proposed. In this paper, a distributed low-redundancy information sharing algorithm (DLRA) is designed based on the receiver-oriented multiple access (ROMA). However, ROMA is an efficient scheduling MAC protocol that utilizes MBAA, it cannot guarantee the efficiency of information sharing with low redundancy and low energy consumption requirements. Aiming to solve the problem, our protocol inserts sub-slots in the scheduling access phase to exchange packet information in order to reduce the redundant data and accelerate the rate of information sharing. Finally, the performance of DLRA is compared with ROMA by simulations. DLRA shows a 20% lower redundancy rate and lower delay in information sharing, which demonstrates that our algorithm is a valid way to solve the similar problems.
The IEEE 802.15.4 radio standard features the possibility for IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to run on batteries for several years. This is made possible by duty-cycling medium access control (MAC) protocols, which allow IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to leave their radios in energy-saving sleep modes most of the time. Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL’s delays by between 33.51% and 39.84%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16% and 2.03% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL’s memory requirements. SMOR’s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55% and 2.74% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks.
Mobile data offloading is a highly promising approach in mobile networks that tackles network congestion at Base Stations (BSs) and greatly improves both the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. It presents significant business opportunities for operators, particularly in light of the exponential growth in mobile data traffic and the ongoing digital transformation. To effectively uphold the desired levels of QoS and QoE in the elevation of escalating digitalization and the unprecedented surge in data traffic, this paper presents offloading through a diverse range of technologies such as data offloading through Small Cell Networks (SCNs), Wi-Fi offloading, Device-to-Device (D2D) offloading, and data offloading through Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). The SCNs and Wi-Fi offloading involve migrating data traffic to the alternative infrastructure i.e. the small BS and the Wi-Fi Access Points (AP), respectively while D2D focuses on transferring data through the device without transversing the BSs. VANETs is the process of offloading data in vehicular scenarios that consist of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Additionally, mobile data offloading from cellular BS is categorized into four main factors: energy consumption or energy awareness, economic considerations, user satisfaction, and network congestion. These factors play a crucial role in the ongoing adoption and implementation of mobile data offloading strategies. Different technologies utilize diverse techniques to tackle the challenge of offloading, aligning with their specific research objectives. This paper delves into the challenges and outlines future research directions in the field of mobile traffic offloading.
The use of the personal Internet of Things (PIoT) is rapidly expanding across a range of application areas. It is needed for real-time monitoring, wireless coverage, remote sensing, delivery, security, surveillance, and civil infrastructure inspection. Smart PIoT devices provide new opportunities in wearable, public, and home automation, making them the next significant development in PIoT technology. The study provides a comprehensive overview of PIoT systems, including their architecture, applications, technology, and future developments. This paper begins with a comprehensive overview of prior research about the PIoT network. Then, we present an overview of PIoT classification and a comprehensive explanation of the PIoT architecture. We also investigate the requirements and technology of the PIoT network. Additionally, we provide a thorough examination of several applications for PIoT networks. Moreover, we emphasize some significant challenges and ongoing problems confronting the PIoT network. Finally, we address recent research trends and outline potential future study directions.

With the drastic increase of their urban population, cities face huge challenges to maintain and update their infrastructures. Assessing in real time the effect of urban policies will be a key tool in the future of urban planning. In this paper, we discuss of mobility and its impact on air quality. We introduce a pilot project in which low cost IoT sensors are used to monitor flow of cars and pedestrians and concentration of particulate matters within the Australian city of Liverpool.
To support the mobility and low cost deployment, the wireless technology is being used for number of applications. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) is one of the evolving technology to provide un-disrupted data connectivity to mobile users. It provides high bandwidth through efficient resource sharing, specially for areas deprived of wired connectivity. These networks also offer self-configuring, self-healing and self organizing capabilities. IEEE 802.11s is a MAC standard being proposed as an enhancement for WMN. This standard includes the use of a mandatory routing protocol at MAC layer, known as Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP). However, HWMP offers weak response to congestion, especially for interactive applications. IEEE 802.11s has also proposed sharing of Congestion Control Notification Frame(CCNF) on reaching congestion threshold. In this research paper, we have proposed a congestion avoidance technique named Congestion Avoidance Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (CA-HWMP). The proposed technique offers localized re-routing based upon congestion threshold, with minimal overheads. The re-routing decision is taken by the each node using CCNF received from the next hop neighbor. The proposed algorithm do not add any overhead as the CCNF is already the design part of 802.11s. This paper also shows comparison of proposed technique against HWMP under NS3 for the validation of proposed idea. From the comparison we concluded that use of CA-HWMP as replacement of HWMP significantly improves the performance of IEEE 802.11s.
Meeting the energy goals of the European Union requires new ways of managing energy. Decentralized energy management, cross-commodity energy production and usage optimization are promising means. Future neighbourhoods will include multiple forms of energy such as electricity, heat, and cooling. According to our vision, the smart neighbourhoods, can optimize energy across different vectors by sharing resources in a controlled way.    The first contribution of this paper is a comprehensive review on market, regulatory and technological status to support the transition towards distributed cross-commodity energy management with focus on Germany and Finland. Markets disruption could lead to more decentralized structures. Mechanisms therefore have been proposed, but mostly without sector integration.    Clean Energy Package includes legislation that is supportive towards cross-commodity energy sharing solutions. Corresponding implementation in Germany and Finland may be successful in both countries even though it differs.    Regarding technology, the article identifies required technical components (IoT, AI and blockchain) focusing on their support decentralized and cross-sector energy systems. Key components of IoT are wireless communication and interoperability middleware. AI provides key technologies for modelling and optimization of sector-integrated and distributed energy systems. Even if there has been lots of research, practical implementations are still lacking. Furthermore, many technical challenges still exist for blockchain based solutions in decentralized energy systems. Moreover, organizational, and legal responsibilities need to be clarified to support the adoption of blockchains in decentralized energy systems. Finally, the article gives recommendations regarding an increasing implementation of cross-commodity sharing and how it can contribute to the energy transition.                        Giving an overview of cross-commodity energy sharing in Finland and Germany.        It is shown how recent energy market development support energy transition.        Comparing the regulatory framework for smart components in energy markets.        Combination of IoT, AI and Blockchain to enable decentralized energy markets.
With the progression of advancements in technology, several innovations has been made in the field of communications that are transiting to Internet of Things. In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. As air pollution being a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings that need to be controlled. Hence, we deployed WSN nodes for constant monitoring of the air pollution around the city and the moving public transport buses and cars. This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city. Our proposed architecture having innovative mesh network will be more efficient way of gathering data from the nodes of WSN. It will have lots of benefits with respect to the future concept of Smart Cities that will have the new technologies related to Internet of Things.
Efficient and sustainable sea transport is a key aspect to ensure cost competitive ship operation. The constant need to increase economic feasibility, energy efficiency and safety while complying with emission regulations motivates further developments and improvements in voyage optimization and weather routing systems. These systems optimize a voyage based on meteorological and oceanographic information taking into account ship characteristics and routing information. The quality of the provided route not only depends on the quality of this data, but also on the modeling of the optimization problem and the algorithm chosen to solve it. Due to the wide range of mathematical approaches and consequently challenges in decision making, this paper aims to give a comprehensive and comparative overview of the existing state-of-the-art methods by a thorough literature review and elaboration of different modeling approaches, optimization algorithms, and their application in weather routing systems. The research shows that approaches range from modeling the weather routing problem as a constrained graph problem, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem or as combination of both. Based on the formulation of the ship weather routing optimization problem different methods are used to solve it ranging from Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programing and optimal control methods to isochrone methods or iterative approaches for solving nonlinear optimization problems. However, it can be concluded that the determination whether an approach is suitable, produces sufficient results and may be recommended, strongly depends on the specific requirements concerning optimization objectives, control variables and constraints as well as the implementation.
Data items are often associated with a location in which they are present or collected, and their relevance or influence decays with their distance. Aggregate values over such data thus depend on the observing location, where the weight given to each item depends on its distance from that location. We term such aggregation        Spatially-decaying aggregation has numerous applications: Individual sensor nodes collect readings of an environmental parameter such as contamination level or parking spot availability; the nodes then communicate to integrate their readings so that each location obtains contamination level or parking availability in its neighborhood. Nodes in a p2p network could use a summary of content and properties of nodes in their neighborhood in order to guide search. In graphical databases such as Web hyperlink structure, properties such as subject of pages that can reach or be reached from a page using link traversals provide information on the page.    We formalize the notion of spatially-decaying aggregation and develop efficient algorithms for fundamental aggregation functions, including sums and averages, random sampling, heavy hitters, quantiles, and
A technique to remotely reconfigure the entire FPGA in distributed sensor nodes.        Uses small amount of reconfiguration logic, but no microcontroller or softcore processor.         Fully wireless upload of new configuration      to sensor node's flash memory.        Remote reconfiguration and wireless upload operations do not drastically increase the sensor node's power consumption.               Recently, sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) for high-speed, low-power processing and reconfigurability. Reconfigurability enables adaptation of functionality and performance to changing requirements. This paper presents an efficient architecture for full remote reconfiguration of FPGA-based wireless sensors. The novelty of the work includes the ability to wirelessly upload new configuration      to remote sensor nodes using a protocol developed to provide full remote access to the flash memory of the sensor nodes. Results show that the FPGA can be remotely reconfigured in 1.35 s using a      stored in the flash memory. The proposed scheme uses negligible amount of FPGA logic and does not require a dedicated microcontroller or softcore processor. It can help develop truly flexible IoT, where the FPGAs on thousands of sensor nodes can be reprogrammed or new configuration      uploaded without requiring physical access to the nodes.

Recently, various types of wireless networks and mobile communication technologies have emerged; particularly the Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) improving significantly the capacities of mobile communications. This paper aims to propose new insights on theoretical aspects of WMN by giving a novel modeling approach.    We lean on formal methods to show how to define a precise semantics for WMN and how to formally analyze their routing protocols. We combine the logical reflection of Maude language and the hierarchical structure of the Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS) to provide an executable formal model for WMN. This model, called Bis-WMN specifies both the WMN topology and any behavior which may be observed during its routing process. Some inherent properties have been then checked with the LTL model checker of Maude.
In dynamic nature of WMN, handoff latency is a significant parameter of research. When a mesh client leaves the range of serving mesh router and searches for accessing a new router based on good SNR (Signal to Noise) ratio, a handoff procedure takes place. Whenever a mobile client leaves the range of its Home Mesh Router (HMR) and connects to a Foreign Mesh Router (FMR), mobile (roaming) client needs to authenticate itself as a legitimate node to its FMR in order to get the network services. Several handoff authentication techniques have been suggested by different researchers but leads to certain types of drawbacks i.e. handoff latency, computational overhead, security threats and storage overhead. In order to overwhelm over these hitches, this manuscript propose a technique Fast Handoff Technique (FHT). The suggested technique is compared and evaluated over the network metrics i.e. handoff latency and computational overhead. Further the approach is proved by describing a formal analysis over parameters.
The problem of oblivious routing in fixed connection networks with a limited amount of space available to buffer packets is studied. We show that for an      processor network with a constant number of connections and a constant number of buffers any deterministic pure source-oblivious strategy realizing all partial permutations requires Ω(    ) time. The consequence of this result for well-known networks is discussed.
While IEEE 802.15.4 protocol is being considered as a promising technology for WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks), several issues are still open. In particular, how to construct a mesh topology and how the router/coordinator can save energy while being effective. This paper deals with these problems, discusses the ambiguities regarding the use of mesh topology and proposes a new collision-free beacon scheduling mechanism to construct a mesh WPAN. The details of the protocol, ADCF MAC (Adaptive and Distributed Collision-Free Medium Access Control), will be fully described and analyzed. Preliminary simulation results show the performance of this algorithm.
Honeypot technologies are becoming increasingly popular in cybersecurity as they offer valuable insights into adversary behavior with a low rate of false detections. By diverting the attention of potential attackers and siphoning off their resources, honeypots are a powerful tool for protecting critical assets within a network. However, the cybersecurity landscape constantly evolves, and professional attackers are always working to uncover and bypass honeypots. Once an adversary successfully identifies a deception mechanism in place, they may change their tactics, potentially causing significant harm to the network. Maintaining a high level of deception is crucial for honeypots to remain undetectable. This paper explores various deception techniques designed specifically for honeypots to enhance their performance while making them impervious to detection. Previous research has not provided a detailed comparison of these techniques, particularly those tailored to honeynets. Therefore, we categorize the presented techniques into relevant classes, subject them to a comparative analysis, and evaluate their effectiveness in simulation scenarios. We also present a mathematical model that comprehensively represents and compares various honeynet research endeavors. In addition, we provide insightful suggestions that highlight the existing research gaps in this field and offer a roadmap for future expansion. This includes extending deception techniques to emulate vulnerabilities inherent in 5G and software-defined networks, which address the evolving challenges of the cybersecurity landscape. The findings and insights presented in this paper are valuable to honeypot developers and cybersecurity researchers alike, providing a vital resource for advancing the field and fortifying network defenses against ever-evolving threats.
Comparison of existing route choice models: GEV, Probit, Combination of Nested Logit.        Comparison in terms of correlations taking Daganzo and Sheffi (1977) as a target.        Analysis of results on five small and medium-size networks.        Slight amelioration in performance, through a change in the error structure of Link Nested Logit (LNL) and Combination of Nested Logit (CoNL).              This paper investigates the performance – in terms of choice probabilities and correlations – of existing and new specifications of closed-form route choice models with flexible correlation patterns, namely the Link Nested Logit (LNL), the Paired Combinatorial Logit (PCL) and the more recent Combination of Nested Logit (CoNL) models. Following a consolidated track in the literature, choice probabilities and correlations of the Multinomial Probit (MNP) model are taken as targets. Laboratory experiments on small/medium-size networks are illustrated, also leveraging a procedure for practical calculation of correlations of any GEV models. Results show that models with inherent limitations in the coverage of the domain of feasible correlations yield unsatisfactory performance, whilst the specifications of the CoNL proposed in the paper appear the best in fitting both MNP correlations and probabilities. The performance of the models is appreciably ameliorated by introducing lower bounds to the nesting parameters. Overall, the paper provides guides for the practical application of tested models.
The Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) is widely used for data collection in Wireless Sensor Network applications. However its usage has been mostly limited to static networks and previous studies indicate that the performance of standard CTP drops sharply in mobile sensor networks. In this paper, we first show that CTP outperforms standard MANET routing protocols in these scenarios. Then, we propose an enhancement to CTP, named Fixed-Node Aided CTP (FNA-CTP) to further improve the performance of CTP in mobile sensor networks. We use simulation results to show the superior performance of FNA- CTP in mobile environments and discuss various design issues associated with this scheme.
This work focuses on the performance analysis of parallel bidirectional periodic peer-to-peer communication using IEEE 802.15.4 communication. The IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard forms the basis of popular communication protocols for wireless mesh networks such as the ZigBee specification, which received remarkable attention in recent years because of the growing popularity of the Internet of Things. The high rate bidirectional periodic data transfer is a commonly used traffic type in many applications on these networks, such as closed-loop networked control, sensor monitoring, and audio or video transmission. A distributed approach based on the packets received was used to monitor the performance indicators (jitter and packet loss rate) of the peer-to-peer communication in every communication node. As a performance analysis we carried out practical measurements in different cases: with and without ACK; different packet size and period; with and without parallel competitive traffic. Based on the practical results we proposed a parallel data transmission technique that increases the throughput of the sensor network.
The Open MPI library is widely employed for implementing the message-passing programming model on parallel applications running on distributed memory computer systems, such as large data centers. These applications aim to utilize the highest amount of resources required by High Performance Computing (HPC). The interconnection network is an essential part of the HPC environment, as processes on parallel applications are constantly communicating and sharing data. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a different networking approach that separates the control plane from the data forwarding plane, which can be configured depending on the network status or specific requirements of parallel application communications. Given that the communication time significantly contributes to the overall execution time of a parallel program and considering the elapsed time during Open MPI initialization of TCP connections between processes in Ethernet networks, this paper proposes the integration of a software defined networking environment into the Open MPI library. The primary objective of our contribution is to provide the network controller with information about Open MPI processes, in order to configure the network during the initialization procedure of the Open MPI library. This may facilitate the development of SDN-based routing techniques that reduce communication times, and thus execution times, using application information, such as the Open MPI endpoints participating in a parallel program execution. To demonstrate the utility of the information provided by Open MPI processes, we have implemented a routing algorithm that will calculate the optimal paths between processes based on the weighted Dijkstra algorithm, using the number of flows traversing the topology links. The evaluation of the proposed mechanism utilizing a 2-stage fat tree topology and two parallel applications - a matrix product and the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) - showed significant improvements in execution time, with reductions of up to 2.5 times for a 4096 × 4096 matrix product and 1.3 times for an 8192 × 8192 matrix product, as well as a 1.5 times reduction for MPAS in the worst network occupancy scenario. This demonstrates the improvements in communication and therefore execution time.                       Software Defined Network environment integration into Open MPI library.        Open MPI processes initialization time on Ethernet networks.        Impact of communication time in Open MPI processes.        Reduction of execution time in Open MPI processes by optimizing communication time.

After an initial push to outsource every single computation to remote data centers, the edge compute paradigm can now provide the necessary balance of scalability and timeliness for successful manufacturing deployments. By consolidating compute resources that were previously distributed across the shop floor, a major emphasis is being placed on the manufacturing network, which has adapted to its new role by converging the IT and OT domains into a scalable, timely, highly available, and secure network.    This work centers around security mechanisms to secure virtualization-based manufacturing. Our proposed concept uses only measures in the network layer, where we see the greatest benefits, while providing the possibility to deploy it in brownfield environments today. Validation is performed by challenging it with known and emerging security threats, the cyber kill chain, and IEC 62443-3-3, improving the security level in most metrics in contrast to perimeter-based legacy architectures. In future work, the validated concept can be extended to the physical, host and application layers, providing holistic IT/OT security and enabling secure edge cloud-enabled manufacturing.
Consider an undirected network with traversal times on its edges and a set of commodities with connection requests from sources to destinations and release dates. The non-stop disjoint trajectories problem is to find trajectories that fulfill all requests, such that the commodities never meet. In this extension to the           -complete disjoint paths problem, trajectories must satisfy a non-stop condition, which disallows waiting at vertices or along arcs. This problem variant appears, for example, when disjoint aircraft trajectories shall be determined or in bufferless packet routing. We study the border of tractability for feasibility and optimization problems on three graph classes that are frequently used where space and time are discretized simultaneously: the path, the grid, and the mesh. We show that if all commodities have a common release date, feasibility can be decided in polynomial time on paths. For the unbounded mesh and unit-costs, we show how to construct optimal trajectories. In contrast, if commodities have individual release intervals and turns are forbidden, then even feasibility is           -complete for the path. For the mesh and arbitrary edge costs, with individual release dates and turning abilities of commodities restricted to at most 90°, we show that optimization and approximation are not fixed-parameter tractable.
Earlier research in the field of routing protocols was extensively based on one constraint like shortest path between source to destination. There are several other parameters (such as dropping header packets in case of congestion in the network or alternate path in case of link failure) which should be considered for making efficient routing decision. In recent years, active research in the field of routing protocols has been done to make routing decision based on more than one constraint. Fuzzy inference system is one such system which offers a natural way of accepting multiple input constraints which are uncertain and imprecise in nature. This paper aims at analyzing the performance of AODV and DSR routing protocols using fuzzy inference system. Further the behavior of these protocols is analyzed in both cases (with and without fuzzy inference system).
The advent of Wi-Fi in the 1990s stimulated the creation of Community networks (CNs), a new networking paradigm deployed and maintained by their users. The non-profit and grassroots self-organization of CNs has shown significant potential in enhancing communication technologies grounded in ethical values, transcending mere Internet expansion to contribute to broader social impacts. Since its conception, hundreds of CNs have been deployed worldwide. However, many have faltered, primarily due to a lack of solid economic models and legal setup. This paper presents   Expansió Xarxa Oberta (eXO)   association, a commons Internet Service Provider (ISP). In contrast to commercial ISPs, eXO follows the same grassroots principles of CNs. Establishing a commons-based ISP is challenging, yet it is a key component for the sustainability and success of CNs. Therefore, our paper aims to dissect the complexity of a commons ISP by explaining eXO, a pioneering example that has already been in production for more than 14 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a commons ISP is described in all its components.    To describe eXO, we have proceeded in two parts. In the first one, we delineate the organizational structure, economics, funding mechanisms, activities, legal framework, and infrastructure. To gain more insight on eXO, in the second part, we conduct a technical analysis of traffic data collected from eXO’s core router, elucidating subscriber usage patterns. Our study encompasses various subscriber categories, including regular and financially subsidized users, Wi-Fi and optical fiber access, and traffic characteristics such as volume, TCP/UDP usage, services accessed, and traffic distribution across countries.
Graph embedding is an important technique that maps a guest graph into a host graph, usually an interconnection network. In this paper, we compute the dilation and wirelength of embedding circulant network into grid and vice versa.
Virtual Private LAN services (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) service that has gained immense popularity due to a number of its features, such as protocol independence, multipoint-to-multipoint mesh connectivity, robust security, low operational cost (in terms of optimal resource utilization), and high scalability. In addition to the traditional VPLS architectures, novel VPLS solutions have been designed leveraging new emerging paradigms, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), to keep up with the increasing demand.

First hop redundancy protocols (FHRP) are an essential tool for improving IP networks’ availability. FHRP are protocols used to manage and maintain the network default gateway router by using one or more redundant routers that will take over in case of default router failure. In this paper we present the first hop redundancy concept and the means for its realization in IPv6 network. We evaluate three FHRP protocols, namely, the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRPv6), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv3), and Gateway Load Balancing (GLBPv6) using GNS3 tools. The First Hop Redundancy Protocols have been implemented, tested, optimized, and compared to one another in terms of convergence time, packet loss and convergence time. The comparison indicates which protocol is the best in each scenario and which is the best overall among the three protocols.
Terahertz communications are envisioned as a key enabler for 6G networks. The abundant spectrum available in such ultra high frequencies has the potential to increase network capacity to huge data rates. However, they are extremely affected by blockages, to the point of disrupting ongoing communications. In this paper, we elaborate on the relevance of predicting visibility between users and access points (APs) to improve the performance of THz-based networks by minimizing blockages, that is, maximizing network availability, while at the same time keeping a low reconfiguration overhead. We propose a novel approach to address this problem, by combining a neural network (NN) for predicting future user–AP visibility probability, with a probability threshold for AP reselection to avoid unnecessary reconfigurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art handover mechanisms based on received signal strength are not adequate for THz communications, since they are ill-suited to handle hard blockages. Our proposed NN-based solution significantly outperforms them, demonstrating the interest of our strategy as a research line.
Neighboring radio networks are those that do not instantly supply communications infrastructure after deployment, have radio transceivers with restricted transmission range, and are unaware of possible neighbors. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is an effective means to convey information through an asymmetric vehicle ad hoc network, and it can provide high security while also reducing energy usage. A new protocol is known as energy efficiency, the D-LAR (Directed Location Assist) protocol, is used to determine a node's energy efficiency. To determine the sleep and active states of nodes, propose a sleep scheduling technique. It can also provide a more accurate location of a moving vehicle than existing location support protocols. In comparison to other current systems, the simulation results suggest that the proposed D-LAR technique has the advantages of decreasing the collision attack detection delay time and enhancing security.
In this paper, the authors propose a fault-tolerant single-source broadcast algorithm for wormhole routed two-dimensional meshes that utilizes neighbor status information to dynamically construct a broadcast spanning tree when up to      − 1 faults are present in an          two-dimensional mesh. Correctness proofs for the proposed broadcasting algorithm are presented and the algorithm is also proven to be livelock-and deadlock-free. The proposed virtual source broadcast (VSB) algorithm can be implemented alone without requiring any virtual channels. However, supporting simultaneous unicast and broadcast messages will require two additional virtual channels per physical link in addition to the virtual channels required for the unicast algorithm. The paper also compares the proposed VSB algorithm with broadcasting techniques that have been proposed by other authors.
maximal sum   of a sequence          real numbers is the greatest sum of all elements of any linearly contiguous and possibly empty subsequence of     . It can be computed in                  time by means of Kadane's algorithm. Letting                          denote the sequence which results from inserting a real number      just after element                     , we show how the maximal sum of                          can be computed in                      time for any given         , provided that an                  time preprocessing step has already been executed on     . In particular, this implies that, given                                                                     , we can compute the maximal sums of sequences                                                                              optimally in                      time, improving on the straightforward and suboptimal strategy of applying Kadane's algorithm to each sequence                                   , which takes a total of                     time. We also show that the same time bound is attainable when circular subsequences of                          are taken into account. Our algorithms are easy to implement in practice, and they were motivated by a buffer minimization problem on wireless mesh networks.
This paper focuses on a hybrid truck–drone delivery system, in which a truck carries goods and a fleet of drones around the neighborhoods of customers, while the drones are dispatched from the truck to perform the last-mile delivery. We formulate a continuous traffic equilibrium model in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the optimal drone routing and truck–drone synchronization strategies when low-altitude aerial traffic congestion arises in large-scale steady-state operations. A customized solution algorithm is then developed, using a physics-informed neural network framework and various enhancement techniques, to efficiently solve the PDEs. The PDE solution is then used to evaluate the operational cost of a truck–drone delivery system, through a dimensionless surrogate model, which further provides the basis for optimizing several service design decisions, such as truck speed, truck routing plan and delivery headway. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the applicability of the proposed modeling framework, and to draw managerial insights for logistics carriers.

Researchers are drawn to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to its versatility and possible use cases in a variety of fields, including target tracking and identification environmental sensing, industrial process tracking, and tactical systems. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on the particular issues that arise from implementing routing in sensor networks as opposed to the more conventional data routing in wireless connections. Due to the importance of energy conservation in the design of WSNs, numerous protocols for routing, power management, and data transmission have been developed for these networks. When it comes to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring, etc., routing in WSNs is crucial. The primary objective of this study is to analyse routing issues and to analyse routing-related optimization issues. Features pertaining to routing issues like energy consumption, security, speed, and dependability are explored later. Attention has been paid to the routing protocols, which might vary by use case and network design. In this study, a comprehensive review is performed on the cutting-edge approaches to routing in WSNs. A brief introduction to WSNs and a discussion of the obstacles that routing protocols must overcome throughout their creation before moving on to a thorough examination of the various routing approaches now in use is considered. The comparative analysis is performed different routing techniques like Energy-Aware Routing for Software-Defined Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks (EAR-SDMWSN), DORA: A Destination-Oriented Routing Algorithm for Energy-Balanced Wireless Sensor Networks (DORA) and Energy Proficient Load Balancing Routing Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks (EP-LBR). The benefits and drawbacks of each routing method, with an emphasis on performance is also performed.
ODMRP builds and refreshes routes by flooding Join Queries periodically. However, excessive flooding wastes the limited bandwidth of ad-hoc networks and causes high control overhead. In addition, flooding often causes congestion and collisions. Finding the optimal flooding interval is critical in ODMRP performance. Moreover, there is no such value for flooding interval that is appropriate for all various types of ad-hoc network applications. The present paper aims to reduce the high control overhead that ODMRP suffers from. We propose two schemes to improve this protocol. Both schemes use the link state prediction method that depends on the received signal power strength for predicting the exact link breakage time of an active link before the breakage actually occurs. By using link state prediction, routes are reconstructed only when they will be soon broken, and thus we utilize the bandwidth efficiently and reduce the power consumption when the mobility of nodes is low. The proposed two schemes are ODMRP-GM and ODMRP-LM. In ODMRP-GM, source nodes flood Join Queries only when the topology is changed. In ODMRP-LM, routes are updated locally by the nodes that predict future breakage time of an active route between refresh intervals. The impact of our improvements is evaluated via simulation.
In this paper we examine on-line heap construction and on-line permutation routing on trees under the matching model. Let      be an     -node tree of maximum degree     . By providing on-line algorithms we prove that:           (1) For a rooted tree of height     , on-line heap construction can be completed within (2     − 1)     routing steps.        (2) For an arbitrary tree, on-line permutation routing can be completed within 4     routing steps.        (3) For a complete     -ary tree, on-line permutation routing can be completed within 2(     − 1)     + 2              routing steps.
A Symmetric Midimew Mesh connected network (SMMN) is a hierarchical interconnection networks (HIN) that capable to interconnect vast number of nodes that could reach up to millions of nodes in the network. SMMN has multiple basic modules of 2D-mesh networks that are recursively interconnected by Midimew network to create higher-level networks. In this paper, we explain the architectural details of SMMN,we also present the a deadlock-free routing algorithm for SMMN using four virtual channels and evaluate the performance of dynamic communication of SMMN network using proposed routing algorithm under uniform traffic pattern .We also evaluate the performance of dynamic communication of TESH network using topaz simulator. It is shown that the SMMN network has high throughput and low latency, which yield higher performance of dynamic communication compare to other Hierarchical networks.
Aerial surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an on-demand and cost-effective solution to smart-city monitoring needs, owing to their three-dimensional positioning adjustment and autonomy. The optimal deployment of a UAV swarm, also known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET), to achieve on-demand coverage of mobile ground targets (MGTs) is challenging in terms of controlling UAV mobility to maximize coverage while maintaining quality of service. Data routing from UAVs to a base station (BS) without awareness of the updated topology causes link breakages, excessive retransmissions, high congestion, and energy holes. Therefore, we propose a joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol comprising three modules to perform crowd surveillance. The first JTCR module provides virtual force-based mobility control (VFMC), which controls the mobility of UAVs to track MGTs, ensuring stable bi-connectivity. The second module provides energy-efficient mobility-aware fuzzy clustering that clusters the FANET to aggregate the sensed data to each cluster head (CH) by utilizing the UAV mobility provided by the VFMC. The third module provides topology-aware Q-routing, which routes the aggregated data from CH UAVs to the BS by selecting an optimal path in terms of delay, path stability, and energy consumption. According to our performance study, the proposed JTCR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of tracking-coverage rate, connectivity rate, the number of retransmissions, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. This is mainly enabled by the realistic mobility control of the UAV swarm at the reasonable cost of control overhead.
We consider the   Capacitated Multi-Layer Network Design with Unsplittable demands   (CMLND-U) problem. Given a two-layer network and a set of traffic demands, this problem consists in installing minimum cost capacities on the upper layer so that each demand is routed along a unique “virtual” path (even using a      capacity on each link) in this layer, and each installed capacity is in turn associated a “physical” path in the lower layer. This particular hierarchical and unsplittable requirement for routing arises in the design of optical networks, including optical OFDM based networks. In this paper, we give an ILP formulation to the CMLND-U problem and we take advantage of its sub-problems to provide a partial characterization of the CMLND-U polytope including several families of facets. Based on this polyhedral study, we develop a Branch-and-Cut algorithm for the problem and show its effectiveness though a set of experiments, conducted on SNDlib-derived instances and also on real instances.
In recent years, there has been an exploration of innovative electric grid concepts centered around power routers, devices capable of controlling power flows as desired. One of which is the Power Router Grid, a novel high-controllable network design fully based on power routers. Its ability to arbitrarily change power flows inside controllable lines raises the challenge of determining the optimal operation within such systems. This paper aims to push further the analysis of the operation and benefits of such networks by proposing a novel optimization model tailored for power router grids based on the most recent literature for the convexification of optimal power flows. Moreover, it demonstrated that radial-based models can be expanded for grids meshed through power routers. The model presented is also convex in the form of a second-order cone, ensuring a global optimum for diverse grid configurations. It has been implemented in Python using the PYOMO modeling language and applied to three case studies investigating the effects of power router operation modes on the grid’s optimal operation and associated costs. Results show that the definition of the power router grid design and the ports operation mode must be carefully decided when demand uncertainty of over 25% is taken into consideration. Moreover, controlling power flow near lines of higher impedance can lead up to a 21% increase in line losses.                       A novel and linearized optimal power flow model for electric grids based on power routers.        Application of second-order cone convexification for grids meshed through power routers.        Analysis of the effects of the layout and power controllability in line losses inside the power router grid.        Implementation of the optimization model in pyomo.
We present the first open-source mobile-based system to capture nearly-synchronous frame streams from multiple handheld Augmented Reality (AR) mobiles and a software to reconstruct a captured dynamic object. Our system includes an AR-based mobile application, a data manager server and software to post-process the frame streams. The mobile application can capture the frame stream while estimating the mobile pose. The data manager server handles the communications and the synchronisation, and collects the poses and the frames streamed by the mobiles. The post-processing software uses the captured data to produce a 3D skeleton or a volumetric reconstruction of the dynamic object.                       First open-source system to create 4D videos using consumer handheld mobiles.        A system to capture nearly-synchronous frame and pose streams from multiple mobiles.        Our system can work using standard mobile networks like IEEE 802.11 and 5G.        This package includes all scripts to capture and produce 4D videos.
Route discovery in manymobile ad hoc protocols is based on flooding. However, flooding suffers from high overhead, which can increase contention and communication delays. In this paper,we propose twonewroute discovery algorithms that are aimed towards reducing these delays. Both algorithms are suitable for use with ad hoc protocols where nodes periodically broadcast Hello Messages. Using the GloMoSim simulator, the proposed algorithms were evaluated and compared to existing methods. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce routing overhead, number of broken links, average delay, and the number of dropped packets. Small improvements in message delivery ratios are also observed.
We study the problem of broadcasting a common, possibly large, content into a wireless mesh network consisting of      end-users and of one or multiple access points that act as gateways to Internet. Each end-user is characterized by a maximum possible reception rate that depends on the distance and on the interface used to communicate with the associated access point. The end-user satisfaction is proportional to the actual rate received. The overall end-user satisfaction is the sum of the satisfaction of each end-user. Our goal is to maximize the overall end-user satisfaction under the constraint that the access points can retransmit at different rates the same common content at most          We show that the problem can be solved by serving the end-users according to a suitable      segmentation, which is a      partition of the end-users that preserves a specific end-user order. When the access points and the end-users have a unique interface, the optimal segmentation can be found in                                   time by exploiting the convex Monge property of the satisfaction function. When both access points and end-users are equipped with multiple interfaces, the problem becomes computationally intractable, even for a single access point. Polynomial time algorithms are then devised for optimally solving some meaningful particular cases.
Over the years, a wireless mesh network (WMN) has been considered as a leading technology for providing Quality of Service (QoS) aware services to end users thanks to its features such as low deployment and maintenance costs. To obtain the maximum throughput in a WMN, an efficient routing and channel assignment is required. But there are certain constraints in the WMN such as end-to-end delay, interference, and available bandwidth which limits the QoS aware service availability to the end users. Moreover, predicting traffic demand is challenging due to the varying needs of the users which further limits the throughput. Hence, to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a utility-based multicast routing and channel assignment (UBMR-CA) scheme. The two main objectives of the proposed scheme are the loop free routing and minimization of the total utility from a source to a destination at any time. The problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem along with the constraints. The utility for a link is calculated using a utility weight metric (UWM) which is used for sending multicast messages from a source to destinations. Once the utility for all the links is calculated, these links are assigned to a particular channel keeping in view of various constraints such as capacity, bandwidth, and interference between different links. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using extensive simulation with respect to various parameters such as aggregate throughput, fairness, delay, packet loss and collision probabilities, and total execution time. The proposed UWM is also compared with existing routing metrics in the literature. The results obtained from our simulation show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes with respect to the above defined parameters.
Wireless power transfer has gradually become a promising way for the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and the design of a high efficiency and high stability charging system is inevitable. Inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, as one of the most important method to realize wireless power transfer, usually work under weak coupling conditions and obtain high power transmission efficiency through resonance compensation circuits. In the case of reduced power transmission distance, the IPT system will enter an over-coupled state, causing the system output power to change drastically and the system to detune, and frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting will also occur. This paper first theoretically deduces the root cause of the output power variation of several typical topological IPT systems under over-coupled conditions, and then analyzes their frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting characteristics by numerical analysis methods, which can provide a reference for the design of IPT systems. Finally, the theory of this paper is verified by simulation and a 2 kW test prototype.
The performance of traditional routing protocols for mesh networks can decrease significantly in disaster recovery situations due to dynamic changes to the network environment. A number of multi-path routing protocols have been proposed to address such issues. MMQR is a multi-path routing protocol for OFDM–TDMA mesh networks which use multiple paths that can be replaced immediately by one another in case of link failures. In this paper we extend the MMQR such that the alternative paths are reordered adaptively as the communication environment changes based on the heuristic model of attractor selection mechanism by which biological entities are known to adapt to dynamically changing environment. Simulation results show that the multi-path routing protocol with attractor selection mechanism outperforms existing multi-path routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput and QoS.
The 21      century’s booming population and escalating energy demands have driven significant efforts to enhance the Energy Hub (EH). The goal is to create a more intelligent and responsive system that can effectively cater to consumer needs while simultaneously improving the reliability and efficiency of contemporary energy infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key enabling technology for Smart Energy Hubs (SEH). While IoT offers a plethora of innovative solutions across various sectors, including critical infrastructure, it also introduces new security challenges. Since IoT devices inherently connect to the internet, SEH systems become susceptible to a wider range of cyberattacks. This vulnerability heightens as the number of integrated IoT devices increases. A single compromised device can expose the entire hub to cyber threats. Such attacks on energy sources have the potential to cripple entire cities, resulting in significant economic devastation. Therefore, robust security measures must be implemented before the widespread adoption of IoT-based devices in energy systems. This research delves into the architecture and infrastructure of IoT-enabled SEH. Following this, the focus shifts to analyzing the primary challenges and security concerns associated with their deployment. Finally, the research emphasizes cutting-edge approaches and tools that can bolster the security and resilience of IoT-enabled SEH against contemporary physical and cyber threats. Implementing secure and advanced data transmission systems based on blockchain technology holds promise in safeguarding the entire EH from cyber-physical attacks in the future.
A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to compare the clinical efficacy of immunomodulatory drug-containing regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone had a significant advantage in improving progression-free survival of patients compared with other immunomodulatory drug-containing regimens.                   Previous network meta-analyses combined studies of immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)–containing and IMiD-free regimens, despite a lack of head-to-head randomized controlled trials to robustly link them. However, patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) treated with IMiD-containing regimens differ from those treated with IMiD-free regimens, especially relating to treatment history, which is an important treatment-effect modifier requiring clinical consideration when evaluating the most appropriate subsequent treatment options. A need exists to separately assess the efficacy of treatment regimens for patients who are suitable candidates for IMiD-containing and IMiD-free regimens. The presented analyses will enable clinicians to assess the best regimens to use in patients suitable for IMiD-containing regimens.      Materials and Methods    We used a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare IMiD-containing regimens in patients with RRMM. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted stratified by previous therapy line, previous bortezomib therapy, and previous lenalidomide therapy.           The results indicated that triplet combinations are more effective than doublet combinations. Of the triplet combinations, daratumumab, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (DRd) was significantly better in improving progression-free survival in patients with RRMM than were other IMiD-containing regimens (lenalidomide, dexamethasone [Rd]: hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; carfilzomib, Rd: HR, 0.54; elotuzumab, Rd: HR, 0.54; ixazomib, Rd: HR, 0.50). Similar trends were observed for overall survival and overall response. DRd showed the greatest probability of being the best treatment for all clinical efficacy outcomes. The subgroup analyses results were consistent with the base-case results.           In patients with RRMM who are suitable for an IMiD-containing regimen, DRd showed clear advantages in survival and response outcomes compared with other IMiD-containing regimens.
Nowadays, online applications are moving to the cloud, and for delay-sensitive ones, the cloud is being extended with edge/fog domains. Emerging cloud platforms that tightly integrate compute and network resources enable novel services, such as versatile IoT (Internet of Things), augmented reality or Tactile Internet applications. Virtual infrastructure managers (VIMs), network controllers and upper-level orchestrators are in charge of managing these distributed resources. A key and challenging task of these orchestrators is to find the proper placement for software components of the services. As the basic variant of the related theoretical problem (Virtual Network Embedding) is known to be         -hard, heuristic solutions and approximations can be addressed. In this paper, we propose two architecture options together with proof-of-concept prototypes and corresponding embedding algorithms, which enable the provisioning of delay-sensitive IoT applications. On the one hand, we extend the VIM itself with network-awareness, typically not available in today's VIMs. On the other hand, we propose a multi-layer orchestration system where an orchestrator is added on top of VIMs and network controllers to integrate different resource domains. We argue that the large-scale performance and feasibility of the proposals can only be evaluated with complete prototypes, including all relevant components. Therefore, we implemented fully-fledged solutions and conducted large-scale experiments to reveal the scalability characteristics of both approaches. We found that our VIM extension can be a valid option for single-provider setups encompassing even 100 edge domains (Points of Presence equipped with multiple servers) and serving a few hundreds of customers. Whereas, our multi-layer orchestration system showed better scaling characteristics in a wider range of scenarios at the cost of a more complex control plane including additional entities and novel APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
In this paper, the traditional ant colony algorithm has a slow convergence rate for routing optimization of Mesh networks. A multi-path routing protocol based on improved ant colony algorithm, Fortified Ant protocol, is proposed. The protocol first adds a sorting algorithm based on the ant colony algorithm, and introduces the concept of elite ants to improve the speed of routing optimization. Secondly, this paper also studies the multipath transmission of self-organizing networks. The simulation results show that compared with ADOV, DSR and AOC routing algorithms, the algorithm can quickly find multiple paths with better quality, with fast convergence and overhead. Less advantage.
Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are dynamic networks populated by mobile stations. Stations in MANETs are usually laptops, PDAs or mobile phones. These devices feature Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) network interfaces and communicate in a decentralized manner. Mobility is a key feature of MANETs. Because of their high cost and their lack of flexibility of such networks, experimentation is mostly achievable through simulation. Numerous tools exist for MANETs simulation, including      and GloMoSim which are the two most popular ones. This paper provides a State of the Art of MANETs simulators and associated simulation techniques. First it gives an overview of the domain. Then it provides a map of the main characteristics that MANETs simulation tools should feature and the current support of these. Finally, a description for each simulator is provided, including an explanation of what make them appealing solutions.
Mines with heat disaster danger have been increased year by year, in order to provide basic data for mine air- conditioning design, prediction of air thermal parameters in the mine unexploited region becomes particularly important. But at present, prediction of air thermal parameters is realized mainly by empirical formula and forecast method of single-line(main trunk road method), existing many disadvantages such as strong individual subjectivity, bad theoretical property and low forecasting precision. Therefore, a kind of air temperature prediction model in whole ventilation network based on wind enthalpy equation is put forward. By the model, air temperature prediction software in whole ventilation network which can make reasonable forecast of thermal parameters for different high temperature mines is programmed by determining air thermal parameters through wind energy equation and considering the influence of natural wind pressure. Through the prediction of the air thermal parameters of the wind route in the fifth mining area in east wing of Dongtan colliery, it can be seen that air temperature prediction model in whole ventilation network is scientific, reasonable and with strong operating nature, which can meet the requirements of the prediction of air thermal parameters in unexploited region of high temperature mines.
Recently, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), enabling ad-hoc networking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is gaining importance in several military and civilian applications. The sensitivity of the applications requires adaptive; efficient; delay bounded and scalable communication network among UAVs for data transmission. Due to communication protocol complexity; rigidity; cost of commercial-off-the-shelf (COT) components; limited radio bandwidth; high mobility and computational resources; maintaining the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a daunting task. For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays. Moreover analysis ad-hoc routing protocols including two proactive (OLSR, DSDV) and one reactive (AODV) is also presented. The results shows that the proposed scheme guarantees high packet delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of latency requirements comparable with more complex and dedicatedly designed protocols in literature.
Many networks have nodes located in physical space, with links more common between closely spaced pairs of nodes. For example, the nodes could be wireless devices and links communication channels in a wireless mesh network. We describe recent work involving such networks, considering effects due to the geometry (convex, non-convex, and fractal), node distribution, distance-dependent link probability, mobility, directivity, and interference.               De nombreux réseaux sont constitués de nœuds situés dans l'espace physique, avec des liens plus fréquents entre des paires de nœuds peu distants. Par exemple, pour un réseau maillé sans fil, les nœuds représentent des appareils sans fil et les liens des canaux de communication. Nous décrivons des travaux récents impliquant de tels réseaux, en considérant les effets dus à la géométrie (convexe, non convexe et fractale), à la distribution spatiale des nœuds, à la probabilité de liaisons dépendant de la distance, à la mobilité, à la directivité et aux interférences.
This paper presents a wireless power transfer (WPT) technique based on self-resonant Conformal Strongly Coupled Magnetic Resonance (CSCMR) model. The proposed model is compared to a capacitor-loaded mode in terms of their transmission efficiency through simulations. The simulations are run using MATLAB, High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and OptiSLang. Results confirm that a self-resonant CSCMR-WPT performs better than a capacitor loaded model. To achieve an efficient WPT, a lot of resources may be required for the model which necessitates a high computational time. Hence, compared to using only a 3D simulation software as reported in many literature, a co-simulation is performed between HFSS and OptiSLang to reduce computational resources. Furthermore, using MATLAB to conceptualise the CSCMR resonators gives better guidance and satisfactory results which shortens the simulation times by providing estimated WPT system parameters for an optimal model. The study concludes that, using the co-simulation has reduced computational time by 93% compared to only using the full-wave electromagnetic simulation (HFSS) which translates to quicker design time of WPT.
This paper presents a practical multicast routing, which dynamically transforms a conventional multicast tree into a multicast mesh and increases the opportunities for coding by applying double direction network coding scheme. The simulation shows the proposed algorithm is a practical multicast routing, and it has better performances by comparing with ODMRP and MORE-M in terms of coding gain and packet delivery ratio.
When something abnormal suddenly occurs in a network, for instance, an unknown link is disconnected or give an extremely long delay, we need to immediately identify the abnormal link to remediate it. Compressed sensing-based network tomography can efficiently identify such abnormal links, by measuring packet transmission behaviors over fewer end-to-end routes. Its performance largely depends on pre-selection of measurement routes, so some algorithms have been proposed. However, when the network size is large, it takes enormous time for conventional route selection algorithms to list a huge number of all routes between transmitter and receiver nodes and select adequate measurement routes out of them.    In this paper, we propose some route selection algorithms for compressed sensing-based transmissive network tomography. The proposed algorithms make efficient use of the property of the Zero-Suppressed Binary Decision Diagram (ZDD) used in the SIMPATH algorithm, so they can efficiently not only list a limited number of measurement route candidates but also select adequate measurement routes out of them. Computer simulation results reveal that, for given networks, the proposed algorithms can efficiently select measurement routes and the delay-difference tomography schemes using the selected measurement routes can effectively identify abnormal links.
For several decades, optical networks, due to their high capacity and long-distance transmission range, have been used as the major communication technology to serve network traffic, especially in the core and metro segments of communication networks. Unfortunately, our society has often experienced how the correct functioning of these critical infrastructures can be substantially hindered by massive failures triggered by natural disasters, weather-related disruptions and malicious human activities.    In this position paper, we discuss the impact on optical networks of all major classes of disaster events mentioned above, and we overview recent relevant techniques that have been proposed to increase the disaster resilience of optical networks against the various classes of disaster events. We start by presenting some proactive methods to be applied before the occurrence of a disaster. Then we move our focus also on other preparedness methods that can be executed in the (typically short) time frame between the occurrence of an early alert of an incoming disaster and the time a disaster actually hits the network. Finally, we discuss reactive procedures that allow performing post-disaster recovery operations effectively. The analysis of disaster resilience mechanisms provided in this paper covers both wired and optical wireless communication infrastructures and also contains explicit remarks covering the role of emerging technologies (e.g., fixed-mobile convergence in the 5G era and beyond) in disaster resilience.
This paper develops an energy management system with integration of smart meters for electricity consumers in a smart grid context. The integration of two types of smart meters (SM) are developed: (i) consumer owned SM and (ii) distributor owned SM. The consumer owned SM runs over a wireless platform–ZigBee protocol and the distributor owned SM uses the wired environment–ModBus protocol. The SM are connected to a SCADA system (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) that supervises a network of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The SCADA system/PLC network integrates different types of information coming from several technologies present in modern buildings.    The developed control strategy implements a hierarchical cascade controller where inner loops are performed by local PLCs, and the outer loop is managed by a centralized SCADA system, which interacts with the entire local PLC network.    In order to implement advanced controllers, a communication channel was developed to allow the communication between the SCADA system and the MATLAB software.
In this paper the main objective is to propose an on demand Quality of Service (QoS) routing algorithm. As mobile users are extensively growing the requirements for various applications may vary time to time, and it is the need to keep presence information of each mobile user up to date hence the approach for QoS routing may not be proactive. The proposed approach has two phases namely route discovery phase and route maintenance phase. When a source node has to pass data to a destination node with QoS requirements it starts with the route discovery phase. And when the data transfer is been finished and route is found it require to maintain path to destination which is been done by route maintenance phase. This is required by the mobile services and the network such as ad-hoc. This is very much desirable and required in mobile ad hoc networks and hence is done in the route maintenance phase.
This paper provides a detailed comparison among emission efficient routing mechanisms introduced in previous works. Emission efficient routing mechanisms focus on reducing of the emission of required energy to operate optical networks such as GMPLS networks, by using green sources of energy in systemic and automatic manner without human interaction.
In the Industry 4.0 era, Digital Twins (DTs) serve as virtual representations of physical objects and intermediaries between the physical world and the digital realm. DTs require proper modeling, design, and development to ensure their seamless integration along the cloud-to-edge continuum. In particular, this work introduces a microservices-based and serverless-ready model for DTs, laying the foundation for cost-effective DT deployment and orchestration. The joint adoption of microservices and serverless computing offers significant potential to address various challenges, including accommodating variable application requirements, managing load imbalances, and mitigating network faults. The proposed DT model has been implemented in different flavors: two serverless implementations—one that relies on a serverless framework of a cloud provider and one running at the edge on-premises—and a microservices one. These implementations have been experimentally evaluated with particular emphasis on the quality of cyber–physical entanglement. This work not only discusses the advantages and drawbacks of different implementations from a qualitative perspective but also quantitatively evaluates them with the in-the-field collection of experimental performance results. Notably, we report that a serverless implementation typically performs an order of magnitude worse than a microservices one in terms of entanglement, i.e., hundreds vs. tens of milliseconds.                       We model DTs to ensure their integration in the cloud-to-edge continuum.        We propose a microservices-based and serverless-ready model for DTs.        We orchestrate and manage DTs driven by metrics designed for industrial environments.
In Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), the optimal routing of data depends on the link capacities which are determined by link scheduling. The optimal performance of the network, therefore, can only be achieved by joint routing and scheduling optimization. Although the joint      routing and scheduling optimization problem has been extensively studied, its      counterpart within wireless mesh networks has not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present an optimization architecture for joint multi-path QoS routing and the underlying wireless link scheduling in wireless mesh networks. By employing the contention matrix to represent the wireless link interference, we formulate a utility maximization problem for the joint multi-path routing and MAC scheduling and resolve it using the primal–dual method. Since the multi-path routing usually results in the non-strict concavity of the primal objective function, we first introduce the Proximal Optimization Algorithm to get around such difficulty. We then propose an algorithm to solve the routing subproblem and the scheduling subproblem via the dual decomposition. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and correctness of our algorithm.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) enables pervasive, ubiquitous, and seamless communication with the physical world. This paper investigates an optimal cross-layer joint routing and scheduling problem for WSN with periodic data collection. The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model such that a joint scheduling and routing is developed to maximize network lifetime and minimize delay. In this paper, an ILP model with multi objective cost function is proposed. The proposed ILP model represents the operation of Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations. The optimal solutions assuming different objectives are compared.
With the increasing of DC loads in the distribution networks and calls for carbon emission reduction, the hybrid AC/DC distribution network (HDN) is a profound solution to increase the efficiency of the conventional distribution networks and allow for more renewable energy resources (RESs) to integrate. The optimal operation of these networks under normal conditions with different constraints and scenarios, including the stochastic nature of the RESs, need to be addressed and investigated. Various studies concerned about the optimal power flow (OPF) of an HDN are reviewed, and consequently, different related topics and issues are documented in this report. The objective function of the OPF process includes the most influential variables that have considerable weight on the HDN efficiency. Meanwhile, a broad collection of constraints with practical limits is required to avoid system operation violations. The non-linearity of the objective function and constraints of the HDN makes solving the OPF is more complicated. Therefore, selecting the OPF method requires a deep understanding of the complexity of these equations and the practical approximations that can be assumed. The method is necessary to be compared with other methods to record its robustness and efficiency. This study helps the distribution system operator (DSO) understand the gains obtained from applying an HDN to their network architecture, with the associated OPF. Also, it shows the challenges that result from operating these networks and what kind of solutions are being applied.                       The paper provides a review of recent advances in OPF.        The paper reviews OPF in hybrid AC/DC distribution network (HDN).        It identifies the non-linearity of the objective function and constraints of the HDN.        The paper reviews the algorithms for the core optimisers.
In this paper, a home energy management (HEM) scheme based on appliances coordination has been proposed for future smart grids. This scheme is based on communication among home appliances, a central energy management unit (EMU), smart meter and the storage unit inside home. A wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN) using ZigBee protocol is employed for relaying messages among different entities involved in our proposed HEM scheme. The performance of WSHAN is analyzed with respect to different networking properties. HEM implementation will lead to socially and economically beneficial environment by addressing the consumers’ and utilities concerns. Increased savings, better peak load management and reduction in peak to average ratio are some of the benefits achieved by proposed scheme. Appropriate use of HEMs in a system integrated with distributed resources along with appliances co-ordination and dynamic pricing scheme provides the optimized solutions for energy management issues in smart grids as confirmed by simulation results.
In the process of building performance assessment, it is often necessary to resort to assumptions to fill in missing information. We address the issue of scarcity of information about the building properties by employing new sensing technology. The aim of this paper is to introduce an open-source, modular and low-cost wireless sensor network of building performance assessment, which is independent of an onsite landline internet connection. Due to its modularity, the WSN can be complemented with new sensors without altering the system. We present the design process, the deployment and monitoring results of an easily-deployable wireless sensor network (WSN) for in-situ performance assessment of occupied buildings. A case study of the deployment of the WSN in a single family home in Switzerland is presented. We demonstrate the quick installation of the WSN and live measurements over multiple months. We derive the thermal properties of the envelope (U-values) from the measured data, and compare them to the values used in the code-based assessment of the building.
Increasing need for people to remain connected while they are mobile poses several interesting challenges for today's Wireless Networks. Information sharing among vehicles can be considered as one of the most popular medium for exchanging safety and entertainment messages between mobile users. Recently data sharing has also started receiving increased attention from researchers. This paper proposes a Distributed Hash Table based File Sharing Scheme for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks using multipath routing protocol. The scheme guarantees multi-path forwarding due to its underlying property of reactiveness and its application of proactive routing protocol. The packets are transferred to distant nodes with assistance of created Distributed Hash Tables which store information about identities of sender's as well as receiver nodes. By using Multi-path Dynamic Address Routing the algorithm utilizes the best available path until it fails to switch to the next best available route in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves realistic performance of file delivery and also has comparative performance with the existing protocols.

The study advocates for the integration of disaster resilience principles into the Smart Cities Mission of India, placing particular emphasis on the necessity of developing infrastructure, establishing early warning systems, and fostering community engagement to bolster urban resilience. Furthermore, the paper draws comparisons and parallels between the components of smart cities, mitigation strategies, and disaster resilience, illuminating their interconnectedness and potential synergies. In conclusion, the study recommends the incorporation of essential network elements to establish a Smart Cities Mission that is resilient to disasters, ultimately aiming to safeguard urban communities from the adverse impacts of future calamities.
The rapid growing scale of electric vehicles (EV) has brought benefit and impact on urban traffic network and the electric power system simultaneously by integrating these two systems together into a Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) in energy. This paper presents a coordinated analysis method of the urban integrated energy-traffic network based on real-world GPS data from vehicles in Shenyang and Shenzhen, China. Case study shows that the integrated system will be affecting each other through the coupling interactions of EVs.
A handover mechanism in a vehicular network can link a mobile vehicle to the Internet. Nonetheless, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have a tendency to change their network topology frequently because of the mobility of vehicles. Since there will be many handovers, network performance will be negatively affected. A new architecture called Software Defined Network (SDN) can be used to make the vehicular network more efficient by making network devices that connect to each other programmable. This research proposes a seamless handover system in which the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Media-Independent-Handover (MIH) Framework are used to implement dynamic topology changes in VANETs. VANET as well as Internet of Things (IoT) plays a good role on the handover scheme. IoT gives a better results in the traffic management, security and connectivity. In order to demonstrate the dominance of our proposed model, network simulations are carried out from a variety of angles and perspectives. The results reveal that when a handover occurs, our solution can greatly enhance network performance. The performance can be evaluated in the form handover delay, handover failure ratio, throughput and packet loss with 5%, 40%, 10% and 2% improved with the existing methods.
Wireless multi-hop networks attracted much attention in recent years. Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) being one of such networks has its own limitations in terms of resource discovery with unstable topology and paths through the networks. So eventually traditional searching techniques are still widely used. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model is the major candidate for the internet traffic mainly due to its decentralized nature. This article evaluates classic flooding, random walk and gossip based resource discovery algorithms under mobile peer-to-peer (MP2P) networks and studied their performance. Further we suggest way to improve these algorithms to suit and work better under MANET. We compare the performance in terms of success rate, query response time, network overhead, battery power consumed, overall dropped packets, MAC load, network bandwidth, packet delivery ratio, network routing load and end to end delay. The experiments are validated through NS-2 simulations.
Digitalization and automation play essential roles in how companies create value for their customers in emerging industries, including autonomous vehicle solutions (AVSs) and automated driving. In this study, we explore digital servitization business models in the context of AVS ecosystems. We utilize publicly available company data to discuss cases that illustrate the emerging business models of AVSs in the business-to-business (B2B) context. We contribute to research on autonomous solutions by identifying four types of AVSs: (i) advanced-data-assisted solutions, (ii) semiautonomous platooning solutions, (iii) autonomous demarcated solutions, and (iv) autonomous swarmed solutions. We advance digital servitization and business model research by revealing business models associated with those AVSs, namely: (i) safety as a service, (ii) efficiency as a service, (iii) capacity as a service, and (iv) flexibility as a service. By combining these three fields of research, we enrich the digital servitization research and address the current gap in research on autonomous solutions by focusing on business models. Our analysis enables the development of novel conceptual tools for autonomous solutions and servitization driven by digitalization. Moreover, we suggest the concept of business model fluidity to explain rapid and autonomous business model changes and adaptation to different use contexts and customer contexts.                       This study explores four digital servitization business models in the context of AVSs.        Such archetypes advance AVSs in B2B context.        Digital servitization business models contribute servitization literature.        The study introduces a fluidity in digital servitization business models.
In the everyday world of computer applications, from the cloud to the Internet of Things, distributed sensor networks are essential (IoT). These computer application devices are often connected to Arduino network connection and microcontrollers such sensors and actuators. Thus, a defensive network with an IDS serves as the need for contemporary networks. The intrusion detection system has unavoidably evolved throughout the years, but despite this, it remains a difficult study topic since the current intrusion detection system uses signature-based approaches rather than anomaly detection. Therefore, improving the current intrusion detection system is challenging since it is difficult to find zero-day attacks in IoT networks when dealing with varied data sources. Filtered Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection with a Data Communication Approach is presented in this study. The five steps that make up the suggested model are Initialization of Sensor Networks, Cluster Formation and Head Selection, Connectivity, Attack Detection, and Data Broker. It was discovered that the suggested model for intrusion detection outperformed both the current Deep Learning Neural Net and Artificial Neural Network. In comparison to the most popular algorithms, experimental findings revealed a superior result of 96.12 % accuracy. The E-shaped patch antenna is a brand-new single-patch wide-band microstrip antenna that is presented in this research. A microstrip antenna's patch has two parallel slots built into it to increase its bandwidth. Investigating the behaviour of the currents on the patch allows for the exploration of the wide-band mechanism. A broad bandwidth is achieved by optimising the slot's length, breadth, and location. Finally, a 40.3 % E-shaped patch antenna is developed, made, and tested to resonate at 7.5 and 8.5 GHz for wireless communications. Additionally displayed are the reflection coefficient, VSWR, radiation pattern and directivity.
The real time verification and validation process for WLAN is becoming essential for the users whose data falls on wide characteristics requirements such as video centric and high bandwidth. Nature of channel being broadcast and presence of MAC in AP makes proper infrastructure and sharing among hosts. This makes research paper about MAC case study and research development with proper verification and validation. This enhances in DLL gives wireless data link and sustains its link with corresponding MAC address 100%, which never bottlenecks OSI layer realization. Among the entire required parameters, only selected parametric dependent layered characteristics such as codes for enhancing data rate, selection of different radio in MIMO and channel, modes of WLAN are verified and validated by constructing clouddatabase in the slottime margin of 24    hours in real-time scenario. The type of data for specific application towards effective use of network capacity under various situations in real-life scenarios are considered upon optimizing the selection of wifi device from lab testing results. This paper further develops a MAC architecture for 30% of internet traffic is video centric and its evaluation under PHY 54Mbps and 512 Mbps with 4 times better throughput than previous one.

Network tomography means to estimate internal link states from end-to-end path measurements. In conventional network tomog- raphy, to make packets      penetrate a network, a cooperation between transmitter and receiver nodes is required, which are located at different places in the network. In this paper, we propose a   reflective network tomography  , which can totally avoid such a cooperation, since a single transceiver node transmits packets and receives them after traversing back from the network. Fur- thermore, we are interested in identification of a limited number of bottleneck links, so we naturally introduce compressed sensing technique into it. Allowing two kinds of paths such as (fully) loopy path and folded path, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm for constructing reflective paths for a given network. In the performance evaluation by computer simulation, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed reflective network tomography scheme.

Rank-mapping algorithm for an icosahedral grid system is developed.        The new algorithm is applicable to the computer with a 3-D torus network topology.        Using the new algorithm, number of hops does not increase with the number of nodes.        The new algorithm achieves almost perfect weak scaling on the K computer.        The new algorithm seems to reduce the communication congestion on the K computer.               In this paper, we develop a rank-mapping algorithm for an icosahedral grid system on a massive parallel computer with the 3-D torus network topology, specifically on the K computer. Our aim is to improve the weak scaling performance of the point-to-point communications for exchanging grid-point values between adjacent grid regions on a sphere. We formulate a new rank-mapping algorithm to reduce the maximum number of hops for the point-to-point communications. We evaluate both the new algorithm and the standard ones on the K computer, using the communication kernel of the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), a global atmospheric model with an icosahedral grid system. We confirm that, unlike the standard algorithms, the new one achieves almost perfect performance in the weak scaling on the K computer, even for 10,240 nodes. Results of additional experiments imply that the high scalability of the new rank-mapping algorithm on the K computer is achieved by reducing network congestion in the links between adjacent nodes.
The rapid expansion of industrial technology necessitates the widespread use of radio frequency identification networks (RFID). Multiple (RFID) components must be installed in order to do this (readers, tags, computer systems, and so on). Networks are growing more expensive and sophisticated as a result of the requirement to add more readers. To supply strong service for (RFID) systems, figuring out the optimal quantity, position, and reader settings is a considerable task. Good planning ensures that (RFID) networks have (the coverage, load balancing, and reader overlapping they need). This problem is well-studied in literary works as a radio frequency identification network planning problem. In this paper, a number of algorithms that were used to improve the RFID Network Planning (RNP) model.
A very important problem in many wireless ad-hoc networks, including wireless sensor networks, is positioning or the determination of geographical locations of the wireless nodes. Positioning is used both in infrastructural aspects of sensor networks, like geographic routing and topology maintenance, and in applications like wildlife tracking. Connectivity-based positioning algorithms in mobile wireless systems are studied in this work. These algorithms compute node positions based only on the connectivity, i.e. the neighborhood information of each node. Many algorithms have been proposed for positioning in stationary node systems and bounds on positional error of algorithms have been derived. The design and analysis of positioning algorithms for mobile node systems is a more challenging problem. Node mobility increases the amount of positional information available to a positioning algorithm. The work in this paper establishes a bound on the positional error for connectivity-based algorithms in mobile systems. The formulation from the analysis is used to investigate the benefit of this additional positional information on reducing positional error. There is a limit to the usefulness of positional information from previous node positions due to movement. This captures an important performance tradeoff: historical positional information can yield reduced positional error but requires more connectivity information from the network which requires greater computational resources.
Community networks are a successful example of a collective where communities operate ICT infrastructure based on the principle of reciprocal sharing of network bandwidth. Cloud computing, common in today's Internet, has however not materialised within community networks. We analyse in this paper socio-technical characteristics of community networks in order to derive scenarios for community clouds. Based on an architecture for such a community cloud, we implement a prototype for the incentive-driven resource assignment component and evaluate its behaviour experimentally. In simulations of large-scale community cloud scenarios we study the behaviour of the incentive mechanism in different configurations. Our evaluation gives insight into how the developed mechanisms regulate the consumption of cloud resources. Our results suggest a further integration of this regulation component into current cloud management platforms in order to open them up for the operation of an ecosystem of collaborative cloud services in community networks.                       We analyse socio-technical characteristics of community networks to realise clouds.        We propose architecture tailored for local and federated community cloud scenarios.        We present incentive-driven resource regulation mechanism to encourage contribution.        We evaluate the mechanism with prototype implementation and simulation experiments.        Incentives improve reciprocal sharing, efficiency and fairness in community cloud.
This paper addresses the atmospheric effects on optical channel for short distance multipath communication links. The main focus is to study the performance of optical wireless system by using optimal path selection criteria using AHP algorithm. The atmospheric parameters such as air temperature, attenuation due to scattering and absorption, beam deflection, optical noise etc under varying atmospheric turbulence conditions were compared to select a best alternative optical path between transmitter and receiver. The performance degradation patterns for multiple optical links are tested to achieve maximum signal to noise ratio at every node. The multiple attribute decision method is employed at every node which involves selection from among finite number of alternatives. Different alternatives, Attributes, weight or relative importance of each attribute and measure of performance of alternatives with respect to the attributes are the main parts in each decision table of MADM methods. The simulation results are presented, base on the given finite attribute to achieve the maximum optical link availability as well as reliability of data rate in a high speed data network.
In today's world of wireless communication, the prime point of concentration lies on data security. This depends mainly on proper authentication of users who are intended to connect to the network. with modern day technology, the credentials (password), which the legitimate user send to the access points for his/her authorization, can be sniffed and used to enter the system, compromising the system security. WPA2/PSK (Wireless Protected Access/Pre-Shared Key) has a vulnerability which allows an attacker to perform Man-in-the-middle attack by capturing the handshake sent by the legitimate user for authentication. The captured handshake can be used to recover the password using dictionary attack or can be brute forced. To overcome the short comings of the current system, the proposed method uses Frequency Hopping Technique to secure the MIC(Message Integrity Code) before transmitting it. This method reduces the possibility of brute forcing the password, even if the handshake is captured.
The multidimensional Manhattan street networks constitute a family of digraphs with many interesting properties, such as vertex symmetry (in fact they are Cayley digraphs), easy routing, Hamiltonicity, and modular structure. From the known structural properties of these digraphs, we determine their spectra, which always contain the spectra of hypercubes. In particular, in the standard (two-dimensional) case it is shown that their line digraph structure imposes the presence of the zero eigenvalue with a large multiplicity.
Emergent application domains (e.g., Edge Computing/Cloud/B5G systems) are complex to be built manually. They are characterised by high variability and are modelled by large   Variability Models   (VMs), leading to large configuration spaces. Due to the high number of variants present in such systems, it is challenging to find the best-ranked product regarding particular   Quality Attributes   (QAs) in a short time. Moreover, measuring QAs sometimes is not trivial, requiring a lot of time and resources, as is the case of the energy footprint of software systems — the focus of this paper. Hence, we need a mechanism to analyse how features and their interactions influence energy footprint, but without measuring all configurations. While practical, sampling and predictive techniques base their accuracy on uniform spaces or some initial domain knowledge, which are not always possible to achieve. Indeed, analysing the energy footprint of products in large configuration spaces raises specific requirements that we explore in this work. This paper presents             nalyser of         equirements in         paces), an approach for sampling and dynamic statistical learning without relying on initial domain knowledge of large and partially QA-measured spaces. SAVRUS reports the degree to which features and pairwise interactions influence a particular QA, like energy efficiency. We validate and evaluate SAVRUS with a selection of likewise systems, which define large searching spaces containing scattered measurements.                       Statistical sampling with smart learning can derive insights of partially unknown spaces.        3% readings can statistically describe the quality of highly configurable systems.        Any 0.25% of the samples can potentially detect strong features-quality interactions.         Partially unknown spaces of 5.3 * 10      solutions can be analysed under 7 min.        SAVRUS suggests Edge/Cloud/B5G changes to reduce up to a 90% the energy requirements.
Recently, mega Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Network (LSN) systems have gained more and more attention due to low latency, broadband communications and global coverage for ground users. One of the primary challenges for LSN systems with inter-satellite links is the routing strategy calculation and maintenance, due to LSN constellation scale and dynamic network topology feature. In order to seek an efficient routing strategy, a Q-learning-based dynamic distributed Routing scheme for LSNs (QRLSN) is proposed in this paper. To achieve low end-to-end delay and low network traffic overhead load in LSNs, QRLSN adopts a multi-objective optimization method to find the optimal next hop for forwarding data packets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively discover the initial routing strategy and provide long-term Quality of Service (QoS) optimization during the routing maintenance process. In addition, comparison results demonstrate that QRLSN is superior to the virtual-topology-based shortest path routing algorithm.
In this work an air-based sensor network for the localization of persons at extensive areas is presented. The developed network consists of a localization device which the person is wearing (BodyGuard-System), a mobile relay station in the air, and a base station. All three parts communicate with the same radio chip. The BodyGuard-System is an inertial navigation system which was developed for localization in difficult environments with high accuracy and low measurement uncertainty. To increase the range of the system, a multi-hop network was built up. The measured data of the BodyGuard-System and the mobile relay station is visualized on a PC in the base station. This multi-hop network is necessary for example for fire department missions.
Graphical abstract                               Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of zinc-dependent endoproteases known to exert multiple regulatory roles in tumor progression. A variety of chemical classes have been explored for targeting individual MMP isoforms. In the present study, we further developed our isatin based scaffold      capable of binding to and inactivating MMP-2 in a zinc-independent manner (Agamennone et al., 2016). Forty four new compounds were synthesized based on the modified     . All compounds were tested in enzyme inhibition assays against MMP-2, −8 and −13. SAR studies demonstrated that 5-het(aryl)-3-aminoindolin-2-ones (        ) were active toward MMP-2 and MMP-13. The most potent compounds          displayed an IC      of 3 µM against MMP-13 and showed a negligible activity toward MMP-8; almost all new compounds were inactive toward MMP-8. Replacement of the isatin ring with a biaryl system (compound     ) did not decrease the potency against MMP-13 but reduced the selectivity. Structure-based computational studies were carried out to rationalize the inhibitory activity data. The analysis of binding geometries confirmed that all fragments occupied the S1′ site in the three enzymes while no ligand was able to bind the catalytic zinc ion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of 3-aminoindolin-2-one-based MMP inhibitors that, based on the computer modeling study, do not coordinate the zinc ion. Thus, the het(aryl)-3-aminoindolin-2-one derivatives emerge as a drug-like and promising chemotype that, along with the hetaryl variations, represents an alternative and thrifty tool for chemical space exploration aimed at MMP inhibitor design.
We describe routing algorithms on networks composed of optical busses. Using networks with short busses and small degree we are able to give very fast routing algorithms. First, we describe a leveled optical network and a routing algorithm for it. Next, we show how to simulate this network on high-dimensional meshes of optical busses (MOBs). We present algorithms for routing, e.g.,     -relations with runtime being linear in     , doubly logarithmic in size and polynomial in the dimension of the mesh. Previous results are exponential in the dimension. E.g., routing an     -relation on a     -dimensional MOB of size                                             ) steps, with high probability.
In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to the most diverse types of applications, highlighting their use in Smart Grids (SGs), such as smart metering, demand response, fault detection and renewable energy integration, as well as in Smart Cities, such as smart lighting, smart parking and environmental monitoring. A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes’ preferred parents. We evaluate the FRR mechanism by simulations and experiments. The results indicate that FRR can reduce the network formation time by up to 50% in certain network scenarios.                       Explores the high formation time issue of last-mile wireless networks.        Proposing a novel mechanism to reduce the recovery time in Smart Grid networks.        Investigates the influence of various configuration parameters of the RPL protocol.
We introduce Fluidity, a framework enabling the flexible and adaptive deployment of serverless and modular applications in systems comprising cloud, edge, and mobile nodes. Based on a declarative description of application requirements, a custom placement policy, and a formal system infrastructure description, Fluidity plans and executes an initial deployment of application components in the cloud–edge–mobile continuum. Furthermore, at runtime, Fluidity monitors resource availability and the position of mobile nodes, and adapts the deployment of the application accordingly, without any manual intervention from the application owner or system administrator. These characteristics render Fluidity an enabler for serverless applications, allowing the application developers to focus on the application code itself while abstracting out the infrastructure management. Notably, Fluidity permits developers to provide their own deployment and adaptation policies as well as to switch between different policies while the application is running. We discuss the design and implementation of Fluidity in detail and provide a realistic evaluation using a lab testbed in which the mobile node is represented as a simulated drone. In addition, we evaluate the scalability of the proposed mechanisms. Our results show that the core mechanisms of Fluidity can support flexible application execution at a reasonable overhead and experimentation with different deployment policies with minimal effort.

High level of availability can be expensive to maintain, but lack of availability may also increase cost as it may damage the reputation of the business. Which led to the development of techniques that reduce downtime until it became transparent to the user. The first hop redundancy protocols are protocols used to manage and maintain network default gateway router by using one or more redundant routers that will take over in case of default router failure.    The First Hop Redundancy Protocols (HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP) will be implemented, tested, optimized, and compared to one another in terms of convergence time, packet loss and CPU utilization, by using GNS3 simulator and Wireshark the results of comparison will be provided and analyzed. The comparison indicates that which protocol is best in which scenario and which is best among the three protocols.
IEEE 802.15.4 protocol is intended to accomplish the characteristics of low power and low rate Wireless Sensor Network. It employs carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol to access the network using either unslotted or slotted mode. This paper concentrates on the unslotted CSMA/CA where the node tends to wait for a very limited backoff exponent value, and cannot perform clear channel assessment until backoff procedure is completed. Therefore, the collision probability and the average delay are high.    To enhance the unslotted CSMA/CA performance, this paper proposes a modified unslotted CSMA/CA that divides the backoff delay into Main Backoff and Secondary Backoff. The Markov model for the modified CSMA/CA is presented to assess a single hop IEEE 802.15.4 behavior, and derive expressions for average delay, energy consumption and reliability. An optimization problem is also presented to minimize the delay while guaranteeing energy consumption and reliability constraints for the modified CSMA/CA. OPNET simulation tool is applied to compare the modified to the standard unslotted CSMA, and to validate the Markov model proposed. The results demonstrate that the modified CSMA improves the reliability, while reducing the average delay significantly.
Graphical abstract                                       Study used nickel-free β-titanium alloy with E (58.5 GPa) and strain limit (20%).        Hybrid manufacturing achieved complex design with 4.5 mm overhanging struts.        Parameters optimized for minimal defects and better dimensional accuracy.        Stent integrity was validated using standard 3-point bending testing.        Stent deployment modelling showed 74% diameter reduction, close to Nitinol.              Biomedical β Ti-alloys possess an interesting combination of mechanical properties, including an elastic modulus lower than 60 GPa. In this study, a hybrid manufacturing route for Ti-34Nb-13Ta-5Zr-0.3O (TNTZO) alloy stents was developed and assessed. The route involves using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) to manufacture thin-walled tubes, which are then laser micro-machined to directly produce customised stents, cutting short the laborious process and overcome the design limitations for stents manufacturing. Different post processing techniques were used to improve the surface finish and cell attachment properties of the tubes. Finite Element (FE) modelling was used to simulate stent crimping and deployment. The study identified the key parameters that control the performance of the final product, including the optimum laser scanning strategies during L-PBF to achieve smooth thin-walled tubes, and the use of electropolishing to improve the surface finish and cell attachment. FE simulations showed that TNTZO can achieve crimping ranges up to 74% following the optimisation of the strut diameter, which brings us one step closer to a Ni-free alternative to nitinol in manufacturing stents that require significant deformation.
Ad hoc networks are highly dynamic networks where the nodes are battery-powered. Routing in such networks is an issue of upcoming concern due to the possibility of frequent link breakage as a result of node mobility and/or high rate of energy depletion of nodes. Also to fulfill certain quality parameters, presence of multiple node disjoint paths become essential. Such paths aid in the optimal traffic distribution and reliability in case of path breakages. In this paper we propose a fuzzy controlled power aware multicast routing (FPMR) protocol that takes into account estimated network evolution in terms of residual energy of nodes w.r.t. approximated energy required to complete the multicast operation, link stability, geographical positions of multicast receivers etc. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of FPMR with other state-of-the –art multicast protocols. The results w.r.t. a wide range of parameters show that FPMR attains significantly high packet delivery ratio at much lesser cost than its competitors, thereby improving the lifetime of nodes.
Manufacturing industries are moving from mass production towards customized production, aiming for high-quality products with innovative technologies, low prices, and high reliability. A reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) is an attractive approach to facilitate the movement toward such flexible manufacturing systems. However, reconfiguration and programming of RMS are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Industry 4.0 technologies (such as robotics, digital twin technology, and IoT solutions) decrease human interaction in the preparation phase of a new production series. One challenge that industry 4.0 does not address is a flexible electrification of the system. The lack of electrical outlets limits the available space on the shop floor, and extensive cabling constrains the motion of humans and machines in the same area. This paper solves these challenges by proposing a highly flexible RMS system with advanced robotics, a digital twin programming interface, and a wireless power transfer (WPT) solution. Experimental results, through simulations and verification by laboratory experiments, show great potential in the reduction of human interaction and time to set up a new manufacturing line.       Graphical Abstract                                           Proposing a new RMS in which a mobile robot can reconfigure the system.        Rearranging, and monitoring the proposed system using a digital twin solution.        Proposing static and dynamic WPT as industry 4.0 technology for RMS.

A novel simulation method is proposed to realize microwave heating of liquids under stirring.        Simulations were carried out to predict the temperature rise with microwave exposure time.        The effect of stirring on temperature uniformity was studied.        The effect of microwave power on coefficient of variation in temperature discussed.              Microwave-assisted chemical reactions present potentially more sustainable routes for process intensification compared with traditional approaches, due to the reduction of reaction times, temperatures, and side reactions. Despite the common misconception that microwave heating is uniform, many processes can be expected to show temperature distributions that vary significantly over the volume, even at length scales far below the operating wavelength. Numerical methods are often employed in the design and optimization phase of a given process, however, due to the multitude of interdependent physics required; the fast and efficient modelling of microwave heating in liquids remains a significant challenge, particularly with respect to computational resources. Here, we report a new multi-physics simulation methodology that models microwave heating of liquids during agitation, requiring less computational resources and delivering temperature predictions within 2.78 % of relative root mean square error. By applying the frozen rotor approach, near-perfect temperature profiles are predicted at approximately 600 times faster convergence time compared to the conventional sliding mesh method. Our proposed model can be used to mimic real reaction systems in a fast and resource-efficient way.
In the context of today's information explosion, how to extract useful information from a large amount of image data and convey it to users is a challenging problem.

This method provides a new solution for the field of image data visualization communication, which helps to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data communication.
In this paper we study an interconnection network topology based on the radix representation of integers and modulo arithmetic. The multiplicative circulant graph             ) consists of              vertices. Two vertices          are connected by an edge if and only if      ¦x − y¦= r            for some integer     , 0 ⩽          − 1. Multiplicative circulant graphs can be considered as a kind of “twisted” torus graphs. We prove that for even      > 2 the diameter of the             ) network is               − ⌊             ⌋ which is smaller than the diameter of the corresponding torus. We also determine the average distance in the             ) graphs. The multiplicative circulant graphs are vertex symmetric and have Hamiltonian cycles, one of them being 0, 1, …,      − 1. The             ) graph can be recursively decomposed into                  − 1) graphs and the later Hamiltonian cycle. Hypercubes and complete binary trees are embedded in         ) graphs with dilation and expansion 1. A (    )-dimensional hypercube can be embedded into               ) graph with expansion 1 and dilation 2        . Multiplicative circulant graphs have simple optimal routing and broadcasting algorithms. These algorithms are deadlock free for      = 2 and      = 3. A simple parallel semigroup and prefix computation algorithm for the multiplicative circulant networks are described.
In this paper a heuristic algorithm is proposed for assigning light trail in a WDM mesh topology. For the given network and connection requests, a minimum number of light trail is to be assigned such that all the given connection requests are satisfied. The approach is divided into three parts. First a Hamiltonian path is found and two light trails are set up along this path, one in the direct direction and other in the reverse direction. Next the traffic matrix (connection request) is divided into two matrices, called downstream matrix and upstream matrix. Next the traffic flow of the downstream matrix using direct light trail is satisfied. Then the upstream matrix using the reverse light trail is satisfied. This minimises the flow time and the number of light trail assigned to be two. The time complexity of the heuristic is computed to be O(n     ), where n is the number of nodes in the network. Major limitation of the presented heuristic is that it works only for topologies which have a Hamiltonian path in it.
The need to preserve the environment has become a real societal and economic challenge. There are many sources of pollution, and identifying these sources, the different polluting substances, and their effects on ecosystems is complex. They can arise from natural disasters or as a result of human activity. The need to preserve the environment has become a real societal and economic challenge. The preservation of the environment can also be done by better management of human activities. However, these solutions require several human and technological resources, and they are expensive. However, such applications are usually deployed in large areas, not accessible and without pre-existing infrastructure, or that would require substantial redevelopment costs) In addition, they have to work for months (or even years) without human intervention. Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used to implement such applications. In this context, we introduce not only the notion of IoT but also Edge/Cloud Computing for environmental monitoring. The proposed solution represents a solution that is both financially and energy-efficient. This paper also focuses on accessing issues to IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) sensors using Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).
