A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes\u2019 preferred parents.

To tackle this issue, the optimization of selecting a content-cached satellite and routing is jointly performed, using the example of Earth observation data cached across multiple satellites. In this paper, we first formulate a dynamic power minimization problem constrained by the queue stability of all LEO satellites, where the control variables are the selection of content-cached satellite and routing in every satellite. To solve this long-term time-averaged problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization framework to transform the original problem into a series of slot-by-slot problems.

This is made possible by duty-cycling medium access control (MAC) protocols, which allow IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to leave their radios in energy-saving sleep modes most of the time. Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL\u2019s delays by between 33.51% and 39.84%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16% and 2.03% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL\u2019s memory requirements. SMOR\u2019s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55% and 2.74% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks."}]}]}]}}}

However, network congestion caused by overlapping routers poses challenges in WMN optimization. To address these issues, researchers have explored metaheuristic algorithms to strike a balance between coverage and connectivity in WMNs. This study introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, namely Transient Trigonometric Harris Hawks Optimizer (TTHHO), specifically designed to tackle the optimization problems in WMNs. The primary objective of TTHHO is to find an optimal placement of routers that maximizes network coverage and ensures full connectivity among mesh routers. Notably, TTHHO's unique advantage lies in its efficient utilization of residual energy, strategically placing the sink node in areas with higher energy levels. The effectiveness of TTHHO is demonstrated through a comprehensive comparison with seven well-known algorithms, including Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Transient Search Optimizer (TSO). The proposed algorithm is rigorously validated using 33 benchmark functions, and statistical analyses and simulation results confirm its superiority over other algorithms in terms of network connectivity, coverage, congestion reduction, and convergence. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed TTHHO algorithm in optimizing WMNs, making it a promising approach for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems."}]}]}]}}}

From the perspective of communication and data collection, the success rate of collaborations between nodes in mobile ad hoc networks and reliability of data collection mainly depend on whether the nodes in the network operate normally, namely, according to the established network rules. However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed.

Wireless sensor nodes are now used as the foundation for the higher-level industrial internet of things applications. Any type of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) application, as long as the data is collected utilizing the device's sensors. WSN are severely limited in terms of energy. Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09% to 68.13%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23% to 29.12%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33% to 82.38% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience."}]}]}]}}}

The behavior of the MANET is analyzed for Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) that maintenances communication among 150 nodes for NCS. The simulation is carried out in Network Simulator (NS2) software with different nodes cluster to estimate the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and control overhead. The benefit of MANET is that it has a fixed topology, which permits flexibility since mobile devices may be used to construct ad-hoc networks anywhere, scalability because more nodes can be added to the network, and minimal operating expenses in that no original infrastructure needs to be developed. AODV routing is a flat routing system that does not require central routing nodes. As the network grows in size, the network can be scaled to meet the network design and configuration requirements.

To obtain the maximum throughput in a WMN, an efficient routing and channel assignment is required. But there are certain constraints in the WMN such as end-to-end delay, interference, and available bandwidth which limits the QoS aware service availability to the end users. Moreover, predicting traffic demand is challenging due to the varying needs of the users which further limits the throughput. Hence, to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a utility-based multicast routing and channel assignment (UBMR-CA) scheme. The two main objectives of the proposed scheme are the loop free routing and minimization of the total utility from a source to a destination at any time. The problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem along with the constraints. The utility for a link is calculated using a utility weight metric (UWM) which is used for sending multicast messages from a source to destinations. Once the utility for all the links is calculated, these links are assigned to a particular channel keeping in view of various constraints such as capacity, bandwidth, and interference between different links. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using extensive simulation with respect to various parameters such as aggregate throughput, fairness, delay, packet loss and collision probabilities, and total execution time. The proposed UWM is also compared with existing routing metrics in the literature. The results obtained from our simulation show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes with respect to the above defined parameters."}]}]}]}}}

A number of methods have been proposed to address this issue; while some have made promises, they all need substantial amounts of computational resources. With this technology, channels based on trust can be set up. The security of the system is built utilizing a family relationship-based method, which makes use of measures that may be used to gauge a node's originality. Additionally, the power consumption and signal strength of the node are taken into account. The complexity and extent of the network need the development of new types of smart grid communication. Finding a way to detect and thwart major assaults on routing protocols is another design challenge. Smart grids rely on these protocols in its data system for efficient interchange of renewable energy. A unique secure energy routing mechanism is developed in this proposed model for secure data communication.

Due to the importance of energy conservation in the design of WSNs, numerous protocols for routing, power management, and data transmission have been developed for these networks. When it comes to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring, etc., routing in WSNs is crucial. The primary objective of this study is to analyse routing issues and to analyse routing-related optimization issues. Features pertaining to routing issues like energy consumption, security, speed, and dependability are explored later. Attention has been paid to the routing protocols, which might vary by use case and network design. In this study, a comprehensive review is performed on the cutting-edge approaches to routing in WSNs. A brief introduction to WSNs and a discussion of the obstacles that routing protocols must overcome throughout their creation before moving on to a thorough examination of the various routing approaches now in use is considered.

The experiments establish that Maxprop routing delivery probability is highest than the others. It has been also observed that the ratio of packet dropped and relayed has been decreased according to buffer size increased.

This article aims to propose a Machine Learning-based Proactive Re-routing Scheme (MLPRS) that aims to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) by dynamic load balancing in real-time network topology. The proposed scheme applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify applications and assign flow priorities based on their type. The betweenness centrality algorithm is used to identify the importance of each link in the network, and the links are ordered in the betweenness set. The proposed method monitors the load on each link and if the critically important links are overloaded, then the flow is routed in real-time to avoid congestion. The idea of MLPRS has been simulated in Mininet with an OpenDaylight controller, and the results show that it effectively improves QoS and network performance. The MLPRS approach contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing intelligent and dynamic load-balancing techniques using machine learning algorithms. The performance of MLPRS has been improved by 3.7\u00a0% and 3.6\u00a0% in terms of Throughput and Bandwidth respectively when compared with the default SDN."}]}]}]}}}

The communication requirements of many-core embedded systems are addressed by the Networks on Chip (NoC) paradigm. In this paper, a minimal and fault tolerant routing algorithm is proposed so as to route packets adaptively through the shortest path in the presence of faulty nodes. Using fault-tolerant routing algorithm to reroute packets around faulty nodes will increase latency. Besides, the performance of NoC is heavily affected by network congestion. Congestion in the network increases the time to traverse a packet from a source to a destination. The proposed routing algorithm adaptively chooses the next node where to send packet, so as to avoid packet drop in presence of congestion.

Nodes are mobile systems or gadgets that are a part of the network, like a mobile phone, laptop, personal digital assistant, MP3 player, or personal computer. Apart from this, the paper also discusses the most important results from 2000 to 2022 from various authors. In addition, the paper contrasts mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks in terms of their uses, limitations, issues, characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of routing protocols. The most important things for ad hoc networks are that the different types of nodes (end-to-end nodes, intermediate nodes, and wireless antennas) are safe and respond quickly."}]}]}]}}}

A marching memory arbitrator is deployed in the path that is prone to congestion which computes the port as a buffer. The static degradation of energy power utilization in the router is solved by using a Marching memory buffer. The secure communication of data can be deployed with hash, identity, and address verification blocks.

The performance of wireless ad-hoc networks depend on the efficiency of routing protocols, especially the routing metric operating within it. In this paper, the performance of the recently proposed routing metric Interference Bandwidth Adjusted Expected transmission count (IBETX) metric is compared with two prominent existing metrics, the Expected transmission count (ETX) and the Inverse Expected Transmission count (InvETX) over the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. The performance differentials are analysed using varying packet rates and node densities. From the simulations results, IBETX metric outperforms the ETX and InvETX metric because it implements the bandwidth sharing mechanism and makes use of the information available at the MAC layer. It can also be noted that it is very sensitive to data traffic rate. It performs well in low and medium node densities."}]}]}]}}}

Two types of robustness are focused in this paper. One is the topology-related network robustness, which mainly assesses the effect of attacks or faults on satellites and links. The other is the network function robustness related to routing mechanisms, which mainly assesses how resource allocation mechanisms affect network robustness. To this purpose, two satellite constellation network models based on physical network topology and traffic are proposed, along with a new satellite importance index and the robustness metrics. Based on the newly proposed satellite importance index, three different types of attacking strategies are implemented in this paper, i.e., random attacks, selective attacks based on the initial state of the network, and selective attacks based on the current state of the network. The routing methods involved in function robustness mainly include different local state routing algorithms, which we summarize into a brand-new routing model with tunable parameters. Simulation results show that the removals by the selective attacks based on the current state of the network are often more harmful than the other attack strategies. Constellation networks almost collapse for the above attack strategies as the attack ratio are nearly 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 respectively. Meanwhile, the larger constellation is more robust than the smaller one against the attacks before collapses. However, the larger constellation collapses earlier for the selective attack strategies. In addition, local-state routing algorithms with a certain level of state awareness capability can be used to improve the network function robustness."}]}]}]}}}

While numerous classic operations research solvers ensure optimal solutions, they often struggle with real-time dynamic objectives and environments, such as dynamic routing problems, which require periodic algorithmic recalibration. To deal with dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential with its capability as a self-learning and optimizing mechanism. However, the real-world applications of reinforcement learning are relatively limited due to lengthy training time and inefficiency in high-dimensional state spaces. In this study, we introduce two methods to enhance reinforcement learning for dynamic routing optimization. The first method involves transferring knowledge from classic operations research solvers to reinforcement learning during training, which accelerates exploration and reduces lengthy training time. The second method uses a state\u2013space decomposer to transform the high-dimensional state space into a low-dimensional latent space, which allows the reinforcement learning agent to learn efficiently in the latent space.

Therefore it is necessary to minimize the overall energy consumption of mobile nodes by minimizing both transmission cost and reception cost and which results in prolonging the life time of the entire network.

The optimal deployment of a UAV swarm, also known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET), to achieve on-demand coverage of mobile ground targets (MGTs) is challenging in terms of controlling UAV mobility to maximize coverage while maintaining quality of service. Data routing from UAVs to a base station (BS) without awareness of the updated topology causes link breakages, excessive retransmissions, high congestion, and energy holes. Therefore, we propose a joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol comprising three modules to perform crowd surveillance. The first JTCR module provides virtual force-based mobility control (VFMC), which controls the mobility of UAVs to track MGTs, ensuring stable bi-connectivity. The second module provides energy-efficient mobility-aware fuzzy clustering that clusters the FANET to aggregate the sensed data to each cluster head (CH) by utilizing the UAV mobility provided by the VFMC. The third module provides topology-aware Q-routing, which routes the aggregated data from CH UAVs to the BS by selecting an optimal path in terms of delay, path stability, and energy consumption. According to our performance study, the proposed JTCR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of tracking-coverage rate, connectivity rate, the number of retransmissions, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. This is mainly enabled by the realistic mobility control of the UAV swarm at the reasonable cost of control overhead."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput.

Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market.

This paper proposes a multicast routing scheme in 2D torus networks. The proposed scheme is a Tree-based Algorithm which Splits torus Networks into two Equally Meshes, hence it is called TASNEM. TASNEM algorithm is a tree-based technique, in which the router simultaneously sends incoming flits on more than one outgoing channel. It requires at most two start-up times, one for each mesh subnetwork. For each mesh subnetwork, the source node delivers a message to the destination nodes along one main path and different horizontal paths branched from the main path. TASNEM algorithm can achieve high degree of parallelism and low communication latency over a wide range of traffic loads.

This paper quantifies the reliability gain of combining classes for reliable multicast in the wireless mesh network. We define the delay as the performance metric for reliability. We then provide an analytical analysis to study the impact of group size, packet loss rate and depth of the multicast tree on the performance improvement achieved by combining classes.

Based on the network function virtualization (NFV) technology, network services can be flexibly provisioned as service function chain (SFC) deployed at edge servers. In some scenarios, such as the vehicular or UAV-assisted edge computing, the network topology varies rapidly due to the mobile edge servers, which changes the routing path between adjacent VNFs in an SFC. Migrating SFC to adapt to the frequent topology change can reduce the SFC latency, and improve the quality of users\u2019 experience. However, frequent SFC migration will unavoidably increase the operation cost. In this paper, to optimize the system performance in a cost-efficient manner, we study the SFC migration problem in dynamic networks with a long-term cost budget constraint. We then propose the Topology-aware Min-latency SFC Migration (TMSM) method to strike a desirable balance between the SFC latency and the migration cost. Specifically, we first apply the Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of real-time optimization sub-problems. Since the decomposed problem is still NP-hard, a Markov approximation based heuristic is proposed to seek a near-optimal solution for each sub-problem. Compared with the rerouting-only strategy, which does not migrate any VNF, our TMSM reduces the latency by at least 21% on average in each time slot.

The simulated results shows that a combination of proper channel model together with an efficient routing protocol enhance the link throughput of the VANET for a fixed network size. Further, performance evaluation also demonstrate the impact of network sizes and routing protocols on packet loss, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and overhead transmission."}]}]}]}}}

Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) is one of the evolving technology to provide un-disrupted data connectivity to mobile users. It provides high bandwidth through efficient resource sharing, specially for areas deprived of wired connectivity. These networks also offer self-configuring, self-healing and self organizing capabilities. IEEE 802.11s is a MAC standard being proposed as an enhancement for WMN. This standard includes the use of a mandatory routing protocol at MAC layer, known as Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP). However, HWMP offers weak response to congestion, especially for interactive applications. IEEE 802.11s has also proposed sharing of Congestion Control Notification Frame(CCNF) on reaching congestion threshold. In this research paper, we have proposed a congestion avoidance technique named Congestion Avoidance Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (CA-HWMP). The proposed technique offers localized re-routing based upon congestion threshold, with minimal overheads. The re-routing decision is taken by the each node using CCNF received from the next hop neighbor. The proposed algorithm do not add any overhead as the CCNF is already the design part of 802.11s. This paper also shows comparison of proposed technique against HWMP under NS3 for the validation of proposed idea. From the comparison we concluded that use of CA-HWMP as replacement of HWMP significantly improves the performance of IEEE 802.11s."}]}]}]}}}

In this approach, numerous nodes share their resources and increase the bandwidth available to end-users. This research investigates the practicality of a new algorithm that optimizes resources based on load for Cooperative Communications in 5\u202fG WANETs. The algorithm consists of two components. Initially, a distributed algorithm for forming a topology is suggested. This algorithm employs a load-based approach to explore network conditions and efficiently choose the most suitable topology. An optimization algorithm that relies on a greedy strategy is suggested. In this approach, the chosen nodes send their bits to the receiver to maximize the attainable system throughput. A thorough simulation study is conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in assessing existing methods. The proposed model obtained 94.72\u202f% energy efficiency, 91.69\u202f% network throughput, 94.72\u202f% spectrum utilization, 27.47\u202f% network delay, 24.08\u202f% packet loss rate, 94.38\u202f% signal-to-noise ratio, 93.91\u202f% data transfer rate, 95.87\u202f% error detection rate, and 94.28\u202f% link reliability rate.

However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %."}]}]}]}}}

Inefficient routing protocol leads to more re-transmission of data which consume more energy.Thus, a careful and comprehensive performance analysis of the routing protocols used in any wireless sensor network is required.

This paper addresses the challenges related to coverage range in outdoor monitoring systems utilizing LoRa, where the network performance is affected by the density of gateways (GWs) and end devices (EDs), as well as environmental conditions. To mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption, the proposed spreading factor (SF) and hybrid (data rate|SF) models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters. The orchestration of concurrent data modifications within the network server (NS) is crucial for uninterrupted communication between GWs and EDs, especially in monitoring electric vehicle (EV) stations to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Employing K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms optimizes ED allocation, averts data congestion, and improves the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR). These methods ensure seamless information reception by meticulously allocated EDs across various GW combinations. To estimate the free-space losses (FSL), a log-distance path loss model (log-PL) is used. Exploring various bandwidths (BWs), bidirectional communications, and duty cycles (DCs) helps to prevent saturation, thus prolonging the operational lifespan of EDs. Empirical findings reveal a notable packet rejection rate (PRR) of 0% for the DBSCAN (hybrid model). In contrast, the K-means exhibits a PRR ranging from 5% (hybrid model) to 35.29% (SF model) for the ten GWs combination. Notably, the network saturation is reduced to 10.185% and 9.503%, respectively, highlighting an improvement in the average efficiency of slotted ALOHA (91.1%) and pure ALOHA (90.7%).

The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved."}]}]}]}}}

Some of the important issues of the FiWi network are ONU placement and energy saving. ONU placement issue affects the deployment cost and network performance while energy saving is the need for green technology. On taking consideration of these two issues we propose a whale optimization algorithm for ONU placement for FiWi network. The proposed algorithm optimizes the position of ONUs in such a manner that all deployed wireless routers can connect to their primary ONUs with minimum possible average communication distance. Simulation is performed for varying number of wireless routers to check the worthiness of the proposed algorithm.

This is done by employing link failure recovery strategies or mechanisms. A desirable recovery mechanism is one that enhances the reliability of the network, maintains low communication latency, and reduces the memory utilization of switching devices. In the common traditional network, it is a challenging task to determine the backup paths since the topology is static. Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture separates the control plane from the data plane, thus enabling dynamic network configuration and programmability. Hence, SDN enables network engineers to create both proactive and reactive backup paths in the network controller. Link failure is considered one of the most current research challenges in computer networks. This review paper analyse and compares the literature on recent SDN link failure recovery strategies. The existing link failure recovery techniques, their challenges, limitations, performance criteria, technologies/tools mostly adopted, and also the outline of how they can be improved is discussed."}]}]}]}}}

Traditional flow-guided nanonetworks rely on nanonodes to transmit packets if they possess sufficient energy, irrespective of their proximity to the nanorouter. In this paper, we present an extended model for legacy flow-guided nanonetworks that offers substantial throughput improvements while reducing the required number of nanonodes compared to the baseline blind transmission approach. By allocating transmission energy to allow more than one transmission during a charging cycle, our proposed model significantly enhances network throughput, facilitating the deployment of nanocommunication-supported medical applications.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap using anomaly detection techniques to discern hardware failure events in wireless community networks. For this purpose we use 4 unsupervised machine learning, ML, approaches based on different principles. We have built a dataset from a production wireless community network, gathering traffic and non-traffic features, e.g. CPU and memory. For the numerical analysis we investigated the ability of the different ML approaches to detect an unprovoked gateway failure that occurred during data collection. Our numerical results show that all the tested approaches improve to detect the gateway failure when non-traffic features are also considered. We see that, when properly tuned, all ML methods are effective to detect the failure. Nonetheless, using decision boundaries and other analysis techniques we observe significant different behavior among the ML methods."}]}]}]}}}

This study addresses the critical challenge of cell scheduling within TSCH MAC, emphasising the importance of selecting scheduling mechanisms based on application-specific quality of service parameters. Despite numerous proposals and evaluations, the lack of standardised scheduling methods and comprehensive performance metrics remains a significant obstacle. Traditional network metrics often fail to capture key issues in TSCH-based mesh networks, potentially overlooking indicators of network stability. To address this gap, we examine both application and network metrics from a mesh network perspective and propose a set of complementary metrics tailored to the characteristics of TSCH. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of how scheduling impacts network reliability and efficiency. Given the diverse applications and configurations in industrial environments, this study offers insights into employing these complementary metrics for a more accurate assessment of the impact of TSCH scheduling. Ultimately, our approach aims to improve TSCH scheduling evaluation and contribute to advancing industrial wireless communication systems."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, we propose a wireless backhaul solution for UDN deployment by considering MultiPath-MultiHop (MPMH) backhaul architecture in mmWave frequency band. In addition, we propose a distributed routing scheme to forward the backhaul traffic over the multihop network. Backhaul capacity and line-of-sight probability of the proposed backhaul architecture for various picocell densities were compared with direct, multiple-association, and multihop backhaul schemes under interference limited scenarios in outdoor and indoor small cell deployments.

When a connection request arrives at a node, the high speed data are routed through the readily available optimal lightpath thereby reducing the processing time. The low speed data are first tried to groom over the existing low speed data, else routed through the readily available lightpath. As opposed to the reactive protocols, our proposed protocol is proactive in the sense that it proactively updates the changes in the network status using the concept of ant colony optimization. Further for survivability backup lightpath is maintained.

Through a wide-scale measurement campaign, we show that many autonomous systems in both access networks and the core of the Internet do permit the traversal of packets that include options, and that the path traversal currently depends on the type of network, size of the option and the transport protocol used, but does not usually depend on the type of included option.

We show that packets that include an extension header can also impact the function of load balancing network devices, and present evidence of equipment mis-configuration, noting that a different path to the same destination can result in a different traversal result.

In August 2019, we examined the relationship between the estimated transportation modes and the hourly wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which was calculated by the Ministry of the Environment using values measured by the Tokyo Regional Meteorological Observatory. The results indicated that as WBGT increases, fewer pedestrians walk and more remain stationary. Sensitivity to WBGT was four times greater at 20:00 p.m. than at 08:00 a.m., despite similar WBGT levels. This may be because fewer people go out during the hottest part of the day, and the sum of those who go out during the day, i.e., those who return home, is greatly reduced. However, this trend was not observed on weekdays. The results suggest that the impact of summer heat is latent during weekdays due to the demands of work and errands but becomes more pronounced during free time, such as holidays and nighttime."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Proposed methodology can extract highly detailed modes of human transportation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Pedestrian responses to weather based on land use and time of day were estimated."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "High WBGT leads to decreased walking activity, especially on holidays."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Reduction in pedestrian numbers due to WBGT rise is greater at night than in morning."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

The primary limitations of the FANET, which is used by the UAV swarm, are discussed. The radio link range between FANET nodes is based on a power budget and various propagation models. Whereas, for determining the UAV flight trajectories, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm based on the modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). This modification of the base RRT algorithm allows for planning the flight of several UAVs with meeting indicated restrictions, e.g., the minimum distance between individual UAVs ensuring communication between them at any time of the flight.

The aim of this protocol is minimizing the energy dissipation of the Mobile Ad-hoc network. This M-EEMC protocol is a combination of tree and mesh based routing scheme. This protocol is used to establish and maintain an active multicast tree surrounded by a passive mesh within a mobile ad hoc network. The multicast mesh is created by using route discovery concept. Pruning mechanism is used to eliminate the redundancies of mesh that is created by route discovery approach and it creates the multicast tree. M-EEMC effectively uses the knowledge of neighborhood node density and mobility so that they complement each other in discovering stable routes in a more energy-efficient fashion.

The proposed router is based on an associative scheme that uses the attributes of the routing algorithm and the interconnection network topology. In this approach routing algorithms are mapped (or programmed) onto a set of bit-patterns that are matched in parallel. To show the applicability of this router, we have selected oblivious and fault-tolerant routing algorithms for ten different tree interconnection network topologies; however, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to accommodate other network topologies and routing algorithms. For the studied topologies, the number of required bit-patterns is of the same order as the topology degree. The proposed organization requires only one comparison and one read delays. This in turn yields a high-speed port assignment that is comparable to single topology routers (non-flexible routers). In the context of flexible router schemes, the proposed approach not only is one of the fastest but also requires a very small amount of hardware for its implementation."}]}]}]}}}

The quality of the provided route not only depends on the quality of this data, but also on the modeling of the optimization problem and the algorithm chosen to solve it. Due to the wide range of mathematical approaches and consequently challenges in decision making, this paper aims to give a comprehensive and comparative overview of the existing state-of-the-art methods by a thorough literature review and elaboration of different modeling approaches, optimization algorithms, and their application in weather routing systems. The research shows that approaches range from modeling the weather routing problem as a constrained graph problem, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem or as combination of both. Based on the formulation of the ship weather routing optimization problem different methods are used to solve it ranging from Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programing and optimal control methods to isochrone methods or iterative approaches for solving nonlinear optimization problems.

Although the proposed methods can mitigate the problem of rapid battery depletion to some extent, the lifespan of sensor nodes is still a biggest constraint. Many studies conducted so far have shown continuous network functions with the help of external harvesting techniques. However, these provide low output because of the limitation on the energy capturing devices. Therefore, energy limitation strongly restricts the usage of wireless sensor nodes. This paper aims to provide high recharging rates and better energy efficiency by proposing a three-step mechanism, which is an extension of our existing proposed work J-ERLB (Joint Energy Replenishment and Load Balancing). In a three-step mechanism, topology selection followed by recharging and load balancing are combined together to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes. Topology selection is performed by implementing J-ERLB on various topologies like ring, star, and cluster. Further, taking advantage of Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) we focus on data collection and high-rate recharging. We have implemented System on Chip (SoC) integrated chip on UAV to achieve goal of perpetual network operations. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed mechanism is tested by comparing its numerical outcomes with existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG (Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering) techniques. The overall throughput for 3SM is doubled in comparison with the existing techniques, whereas the average remaining energy shows 6 times better savings for the proposed solution in comparison to the existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG when varying data rates is applied."}]}]}]}}}

Many researches have been studied to suppress the SI and IUI, to design the medium access control (MAC) protocol, and to propose resource management techniques for realizing the FD system and truly achieving the double transmission capacity in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel FD MAC protocol with a mixture of concurrent and sequential transmission scheme, namely FD-MCST, for maximizing the transmission capacity in multihop wireless networks. Through FD-MCST, the transmitting node can cooperatively share the transmission capacity status for maximizing the network capacity. As a result, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed FD-MCST can accomplish a higher achievable network capacity of up to 1.7 times and nearly twice the achievable throughput with a reasonable amount of achievable transmission overhead about 7.7%, compared to the existing FD MAC protocols."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e418", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e419"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e421", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e422", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e424"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e425"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e428", "view": "all"}, "_": "Cooperative mixture of concurrent and sequential transmission (MCST) scheme"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e430"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e433", "view": "all"}, "_": "Basic relaying flow transmission with the idea of the relaying node concept"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e435"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e438", "view": "all"}, "_": "FD medium access control protocol with MCST scheme"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

Hence, we deployed WSN nodes for constant monitoring of the air pollution around the city and the moving public transport buses and cars. This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city. Our proposed architecture having innovative mesh network will be more efficient way of gathering data from the nodes of WSN.

Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques."}]}]}]}}}

This paper aims to investigate an optimal location for the sink node in such a way that the sum of distances from all the sensor nodes to the sink node is minimized. In an effort to place the sink node within the network our algorithm finds the geometric median of all the location associated with the sensor nodes.

Substantial work has been done by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to optimize the IPv6-ND protocol, known as IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network - Neighbor Discovery Protocol (6LoWPAN-NDP). Despite these improvements, full implementation is yet to be achieved in commercial, open-source, or proprietary sectors. In this article, we debate both Neighbor Discovery Protocols (NDPs), examining various aspects. We implemented 6LoWPAN-NDP in a well-known ns3 simulator. We discuss the complexity of 6LoWPAN-NDP and see why open-source, commercial, or proprietary sectors have not widely adopted it. We present how both protocols function optimally in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios. We present results and analysis of both NDPs control messages\u2019 behavior. At the same time, data traffic is turned on and off, and we demonstrate the operational behavior of Link-local Unicast Address (LUA) and Global Unicast Address (GUA) in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios.

The main objective of WSN is to sense the crucial information from the environment depending on the type of application for which it is deployed and send this information to its Base Station(BS) so that it can take corrective action. These Sensor Nodes ommunicate with each other through various protocols. The problem of the conventional method is, during gathering of sensed data each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station for which it will deplete its power quickly. In this project, we propose PEGASIS(Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System),a near optimal chain-based protocol for extending the lifetime of network. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbour, performing a chain, elect a leader from the chain who collects the data from the neighbours to be transmitted to the base station. As a result the average energy spend by each node per round is reduced and to lower the bandwidth requirement. By using certain algorithm we can propose the shortest path of transmission of data to the base station. As a result less power consumption can be achieved to increase efficiency and life time of the network."}]}]}]}}}

This paper proposes Flooding Factor based Framework for Trust Management (F3TM) in MANETs. True flooding approach is utilized to identify attacker nodes based on the calculation of trust value. Route Discovery Algorithm is developed to discover an efficient and secure path for data forwarding using Experimental Grey Wolf algorithm for validating network nodes. Enhanced Multi-Swarm Optimization is used to optimize the identified delivery path. Simulations are carried out in ns2 to assess and compare the performance of F3TM with the state-of-the-art frameworks: CORMAN and PRIME considering the metrics including delay, packet delivery ration, overhead and throughput.

This paper investigates the minimization of total power consumption by reducing the decoding power consumption. For achieving a desired Bit Error Rate (BER), we introduce some fundamental results on the basis of iterative message-passing algorithms for Low Density Parity Check Code (LDPC). To reduce energy dissipation in decoder, LDPC based coded communications between sensors are considered. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of LDPC at different code rates and introduce Adaptive Itera- tive Decoding (AID) by exploiting threshold on the number of iterations for a certain BER (10\u22124). In iterative LDPC decoding, the total energy consumption of network is reduced by 20 - 25%."}]}]}]}}}

Furthermore, at runtime, Fluidity monitors resource availability and the position of mobile nodes, and adapts the deployment of the application accordingly, without any manual intervention from the application owner or system administrator. These characteristics render Fluidity an enabler for serverless applications, allowing the application developers to focus on the application code itself while abstracting out the infrastructure management. Notably, Fluidity permits developers to provide their own deployment and adaptation policies as well as to switch between different policies while the application is running. We discuss the design and implementation of Fluidity in detail and provide a realistic evaluation using a lab testbed in which the mobile node is represented as a simulated drone.

However, the deployment process of these smart wireless devices when delivered to customer premises is slow and error prone as each of them needs to be provisioned with authentication credentials to access the corporate network. In this paper, we propose HANNA, a human-friendly provisioning and configuration framework for smart devices, that extends the zero-touch paradigm to large IoT deployments by introducing voice assisted configuration in combination with large scale ad-hoc communications to overcome the initial installation effort of IoT deployments. The most prominent role in HANNA is played by the assisting device, which includes a voice assistant capable of correctly understanding a minimum number of keywords required for initial provisioning and configuration of the devices. The device\u2019s role is to interact with the user and ensure that all provisioning details are received. These are then converted into appropriate machine instructions for further use by the mass provisioning mechanism. We provide an example prototype implementation of HANNA and evaluate the performance of the assisting device in the human-to-machine communication phase and the performance of the selected communication technique in the machine-to-machine communication phase. Our results show the potential of existing speech-to-text engines for this application area and also reveal shortcomings with respect to the robustness of the engines in office-like working environments as well as with respect to user\u2019s gender and language proficiency level. Additionally we show that the proposed machine-to-machine provisioning approach is always faster compared to manual provisioning for cases with more than ten devices."}]}]}]}}}

The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming.

Second, the communication strategy shall allow an easy identification of the current factory layout and the interconnection of factory resources.

We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity.

The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer.

This paper contributes to building a new dataset for the aid of machine learning tools to detect the presence of Bluetooth mesh networks. The dataset is extracted from a simulated Bluetooth mesh network with 52 BT network traffic attributes, using the Bridgefy application.

The WSN measurements are frequently contaminated and altered by noise. The noise in the signal increases the sensor node\u2019s computation and energy utilization, resulting in less longevity of the sensor node. The Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is commonly employed in WSN to pre-process sensed signals to remove noise from the sensed signals using delay elements, multipliers, and adders. Traditional multiplier-based FIR filter designs result in hardware-intensive multipliers that consume a lot of energy, and area and have low computation speed. These drawbacks make them unsuitable for IoT-based WSN systems with stringent power efficiency necessities. Approximate computing enhances the energy efficiency of an FIR filter. Arithmetic circuits utilizing approximate computing improve the hardware performance, with some loss of accuracy to save energy utilization and boost speed. A novel approximate multiplier architecture employing a fast and straightforward approximation adder is proposed in this study. Approximate multiplier M1 using OR gate and approximate multiplier M2 using proposed approximate adders are compared. The proposed approximate adder is suited for building an adder tree to accumulate partial product (PP) because it is less complicated than traditional adders. Compared to a one-bit-full adder, the critical path delay (CPD) is reduced significantly in the proposed methods. The accuracy comparison of M1. M2 and Wallace tree using the normalized mean error distance (NMED), the mean relative error distance (MRED), the maximum error (ME), and the error rate (ER) with the number of bits utilized for reducing error. For the area (delay) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.4\u00a0ns for M1, 0.43\u00a0ns for M2, and 1.08\u00a0ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. For the delay (area) optimized circuit, when the bit used is 4, the delay is 0.16\u00a0ns for M1, 0.16\u00a0ns for M2, and 0.40\u00a0ns for the Wallace tree multiplier. To more accurately evaluate performance at the circuit level, the PDP and ADP are computed. The NMED, MRED, ME, and ER versus PDP and ADP are computed. The proposed multipliers M1 and M2 are compared with existing approximate multipliers. When an equivalent MRED, NMED, or ER is taken into account, M1 has the smallest ADP and PDP among other multipliers. The very low likelihood of a significant ED occurring is indicated by the small values of NMED and MRED in M1 and M2. The proposed solutions effectively reduce delay, area, and power while maintaining increased accuracy and performance."}]}]}]}}}

This algorithm improves the safety performance of positioning process of nodes in WSN by using the threshold idea and vote with sensor nodes. The advantage of this algorithm is that no additional hardware is needed, easy integration with other localization algorithms, and the safety performance of localization algorithm is improved obviously. From the simulation of this algorithm, we get the expected results."}]}]}]}}}

Analyzing the impact of each replacement level (replacement of conventional DOCRs by DS-DOCRs) on the protection performance/efficacy of individual network lines is challenging as each deployment level leads to different primary and backup relay protection pairs, which may lead to miscoordination. Also, the random and uncertain nature of faults leads to numerous possible scenarios, which need to be rigorously considered during the analysis. As a more complete and accurate analysis approach, we propose to utilize probabilistic model checking, which is a formal verification technique, for the performance verification of DS-DOCRs-based protection schemes. A formal analysis methodology to determine the optimal deployment of DS-DOCRs. The proposed analysis requires formal models of the behavior of fault, C-DOCRs, and DS-DOCRs-based protection systems, and these models are developed as part of our work. Moreover, we also formalize the quantitative properties to determine the impact of various relay deployment scenarios on the performance of the protection system. For illustration purposes, we use formal models for the quantitative verification of a state-of-the-art DS-DOCRs-based protection scheme for power distribution networks using the probabilistic model checker.

However, most applications of UAVs for wireless communication provisioning are not feasible as researchers fail to consider some vital aspects of their deployment, especially the energy requirements of both the UAV and communication system. The considerable energy consumption overhead involved in flying or hovering UAVs makes them less appealing for green wireless communications. Therefore, in this work, we examine the feasibility of an alternative energy-efficient deployment scheme where UAVs can be made to land-on designated locations, also known as landing stations (LSs). The idea of LS makes the UAV-based wireless communication more durable and advantageous, since the total energy consumption is reduced by minimizing the flying/hovering energy consumption, which, in turn, enables diverse set of applications including emergency and pop-up networking. We evaluate the impact of the separation distance between these LSs and the Optimal Hovering Position (OHP) on the network performance. Specifically, we develop mathematical frameworks to model the relationship between UAV power consumption, coverage probability, throughput, and separation distance. Numerical results reveal that a significant energy reduction can be achieved when the LS concept is exploited with a slight compromise in coverage probability and throughput. However, the choice of a suitable LS location depends on the users\u2019 service requirements, transmit power, and frequency band utilized."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper the hierarchical structuring is done using clustering approach based on efficient data aggregation process. The aggregation process is defined into two phases. The first phase defines the arrangement of the nodes in the cluster using uniform distribution and second phase defines the selection of the cluster head and aggregation of the data using linear programming.

Specifically, RSS-based weights are dependent on the change in RSS of communication links to remove improbable target locations. To ensure robust tracking performance, distance-based weights are assigned to probable target locations. Angle-based weights are used to ensure the correct direction of motion.

Each cell in a schedule is identified with the tuple (time slot, channel offset). A group of time slots constitutes a slot-frame. The number of time-slots with in a slot-frame is termed as slot-frame length. This paper investigates the effect of slot-frame length on energy consumption using 6TiSCH simulator and ANOVA method. A cubic regression equation best fits the simulation results and the predicted values were in good agreement with the simulation results.

Channel modeling provides the information about channel such as path loss, Probability density function of channel fading, path gain and probability density function of gain. Later, threshold selection model is implemented to compute the threshold of video packet. With the help of threshold, channel is selected through which video packet has to be transmitted and finally queuing model is developed to reduce communication delay in mobile ad hoc network.

In that, an attacker can replace the legitimate software with a malicious software with an intent to get control over the vehicle. In this work, we are motivated to address this problem. We develop an enhanced uptane framework for detection of malicious OTA software updates in autonomous vehicles. For enhancing security, we incorporate convolutional neural network (CNN) in the uptane framework. The proposed framework is able to distinguish between malicious and benign software executables with high accuracy. For training and testing, we create two datasets by collecting executables of Windows and Linux operating system. We encourage the use of transfer learning by exploiting the developed CNN models in order to detect malicious executable designed for autonomous vehicles.

However, one of the main issues yet to be solved is how it scales with an increasing number of Wi-Fi devices injecting location-specific traffic in the shared medium. While the recently released IEEE 802.11az standard will still take time before being integrated in COTS devices, this paper aims at assessing the impact of the burst size on the ranging performance of COTS Wi-Fi Android devices running release 12. While increasing the burst size is expected to bring higher stability in the observed distance, on the other hand a longer transmission period for location-only purposes may jeopardize the transmission of data traffic among Wi-Fi users. Several models of smartphones and APs, and different frequency bands, have been considered in order to evaluate the behavior of the FTM procedure in real devices, showing that not always the newest or most expensive ones perform better. Also, it is shown that using the minimum burst size significantly decreases the performance and it is thus not recommended. While bursts longer than 8 may no be always supported by all the models and/or frequency bands, the small improvements in ranging estimations obtained when they are used do not always justify the increased location traffic injected in the network."}]}]}]}}}

Despite its various advantages, LoRaWAN employs an Aloha-based MAC, which in terms of performance cannot guarantee high packet delivery ratio and low latency. To overcome this issue, we propose a time-slotted scheme, called TS-VP-LoRa, which supports multiple transmission times and packet sizes at the same time. In TS-VP-LoRa, scheduling is coordinated by the LoRa gateway, broadcasting beacon frames periodically for the synchronization of LoRa end-devices. A channel hopping mechanism is also proposed in order to minimize the occurrence of collisions and to evenly split the transmission load among all channels. TS-VP-LoRa is evaluated and compared to three other MAC-layer schemes in single gateway simulation scenarios with up to 500 nodes. The proposed scheme has proven to achieve low latency with high packet delivery ratios, significantly minimize collisions and maintain a relatively low energy consumption despite the scaling of the LoRa network."}]}]}]}}}

In this work, we design, develop and demonstrate high power density nonlinear wideband energy harvesters using novel tapered spring architectures in an autonomous wireless sensor node system. These spring structures exhibit a nonlinear restoring force arising from the atypical stress distribution that can be additionally tuned by changing the taper-ratio in the structure. We investigate different tapering designs in order to achieve optimal spring hardening nonlinearities.

We argue that the large-scale performance and feasibility of the proposals can only be evaluated with complete prototypes, including all relevant components. Therefore, we implemented fully-fledged solutions and conducted large-scale experiments to reveal the scalability characteristics of both approaches. We found that our VIM extension can be a valid option for single-provider setups encompassing even 100 edge domains (Points of Presence equipped with multiple servers) and serving a few hundreds of customers.

However, excessive flooding wastes the limited bandwidth of ad-hoc networks and causes high control overhead. In addition, flooding often causes congestion and collisions. Finding the optimal flooding interval is critical in ODMRP performance. Moreover, there is no such value for flooding interval that is appropriate for all various types of ad-hoc network applications. The present paper aims to reduce the high control overhead that ODMRP suffers from. We propose two schemes to improve this protocol. Both schemes use the link state prediction method that depends on the received signal power strength for predicting the exact link breakage time of an active link before the breakage actually occurs. By using link state prediction, routes are reconstructed only when they will be soon broken, and thus we utilize the bandwidth efficiently and reduce the power consumption when the mobility of nodes is low. The proposed two schemes are ODMRP-GM and ODMRP-LM. In ODMRP-GM, source nodes flood Join Queries only when the topology is changed. In ODMRP-LM, routes are updated locally by the nodes that predict future breakage time of an active route between refresh intervals. The impact of our improvements is evaluated via simulation."}]}]}]}}}

For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays. Moreover analysis ad-hoc routing protocols including two proactive (OLSR, DSDV) and one reactive (AODV) is also presented.
