A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes\u2019 preferred parents.

This is made possible by duty-cycling medium access control (MAC) protocols, which allow IEEE 802.15.4 nodes to leave their radios in energy-saving sleep modes most of the time. Yet, duty-cycling MAC protocols usually incur long routing delays since it may take a while until a particular forwarder becomes available for forwarding a packet. Opportunistic routing alleviates this problem by opportunistically using a currently available forwarder, rather than waiting for a particular forwarder. Among all opportunistic routing schemes, so-called dynamic switch-based forwarding (DSF) schemes are most promising from a security and practical perspective, but some security and reliability issues with them persist. In this paper, we propose secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR), a DSF scheme that improves on current DSF schemes in three regards. First, SMOR builds on a denial-of-sleep-resilient MAC layer. Current DSF schemes, by comparison, rest on MAC protocols that put the limited energy reserves of battery-powered IEEE 802.15.4 nodes at risk. Second, SMOR operates in a distributed fashion and efficiently supports point-to-point traffic. All current DSF schemes, by contrast, suffer from a single point of failure and focus on convergecast traffic. Third, SMOR duplicates packets on purpose and routes them along disjoint paths. This makes SMOR tolerant of compromises of single IEEE 802.15.4 nodes, whereas current DSF schemes lack intrusion tolerance. We integrated SMOR into the network stack of the Contiki-NG operating system and benchmarked SMOR against the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) with the Cooja network simulator. Indeed, SMOR turns out to improve on RPL\u2019s delays by between 33.51% and 39.84%, depending on the exact configurations and network dynamics. Furthermore, SMOR achieves between 0.16% and 2.03% higher mean packet delivery ratios (PDRs), thereby attaining mean PDRs of 99.999% in all simulated scenarios. Beyond that, SMOR has only a fraction of RPL\u2019s memory requirements. SMOR\u2019s intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, increases the mean energy consumption per IEEE 802.15.4 node by between 1.55% and 2.74% compared to RPL in our simulations. SMOR specifically targets IEEE 802.15.4 networks with a network diameter of 2, such as body area networks."}]}]}]}}}

From the perspective of communication and data collection, the success rate of collaborations between nodes in mobile ad hoc networks and reliability of data collection mainly depend on whether the nodes in the network operate normally, namely, according to the established network rules. However, mobile ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks targeting transmission channels and nodes owing to their dynamic evolution, openness, and distributed characteristics. Therefore, during the network operation, it is necessary to classify and detect the behavior and characteristics of each node. However, most existing research only analyzes and considers responses against a single or small number of attacks. To address these issues, this article first systematically analyzed and classified common active attacks in MANETs. Then, a node trust model was proposed based on the characteristics of various attacks; subsequently, a new secure routing protocol, namely, TC-AODV, was proposed. This protocol has minimal effect on the original communication dynamics and can effectively deal with Packet drop, wormhole, Session hijacking, and other main attacks in MANETs. The NS3 simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol attains good transmission performance, can effectively identify various attacks and bypass malicious nodes, and securely complete the communication process."}]}]}]}}}

Wireless sensor nodes are now used as the foundation for the higher-level industrial internet of things applications. Any type of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) application, as long as the data is collected utilizing the device's sensors. WSN are severely limited in terms of energy. Routing is one of the most challenging components of WSNs. Unbalanced energy utilization during data packet routing operations is one of the most serious difficulties with WSNs. This issue must be considered because the energy levels of sensor nodes are limited. We used WSNs multipath routing to save energy, improve scalability, and balance load. Many investigations are being undertaken to increase sensor node energy efficiency and network lifetime. More attention must be devoted to the clustering and routing components of communication in order to conserve energy. Clustering, also known as node clustering is a network organizing approach which helps with energy efficiency, workload distribution, data collection, and a connected hierarchy. The network is made up of numerous sensor nodes that must connect with one another in order for data to reach its goal, and when messages are not sent to intermediary nodes, problems arise. With multipath routing, numerous paths between the source and destination can be created, improving the possibility of data reaching the target and providing additional copies via alternate paths. The proposed routing solution uses less energy and extends the life of the network while compared with well-known approaches i.e., LEACH, ECPF, CHEF, UCR, DFLC, ACAWT, and Gupta. According to the simulation results and overall analysis, the proposed technique is much better than all the previous approaches under different number of nodes and simulation time in terms of end-to-end time reduced by 17.09% to 68.13%, energy consumption reduced by 13.23% to 29.12%, packet loss rate declined by 16.33% to 82.38% and drop rate of alive sensor nodes are much better shows high network resilience."}]}]}]}}}

The simulation is carried out in Network Simulator (NS2) software with different nodes cluster to estimate the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and control overhead. The benefit of MANET is that it has a fixed topology, which permits flexibility since mobile devices may be used to construct ad-hoc networks anywhere, scalability because more nodes can be added to the network, and minimal operating expenses in that no original infrastructure needs to be developed.

To obtain the maximum throughput in a WMN, an efficient routing and channel assignment is required. But there are certain constraints in the WMN such as end-to-end delay, interference, and available bandwidth which limits the QoS aware service availability to the end users. Moreover, predicting traffic demand is challenging due to the varying needs of the users which further limits the throughput. Hence, to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a utility-based multicast routing and channel assignment (UBMR-CA) scheme. The two main objectives of the proposed scheme are the loop free routing and minimization of the total utility from a source to a destination at any time. The problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem along with the constraints. The utility for a link is calculated using a utility weight metric (UWM) which is used for sending multicast messages from a source to destinations. Once the utility for all the links is calculated, these links are assigned to a particular channel keeping in view of various constraints such as capacity, bandwidth, and interference between different links. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using extensive simulation with respect to various parameters such as aggregate throughput, fairness, delay, packet loss and collision probabilities, and total execution time. The proposed UWM is also compared with existing routing metrics in the literature. The results obtained from our simulation show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes with respect to the above defined parameters."}]}]}]}}}

A number of methods have been proposed to address this issue; while some have made promises, they all need substantial amounts of computational resources. With this technology, channels based on trust can be set up. The security of the system is built utilizing a family relationship-based method, which makes use of measures that may be used to gauge a node's originality. Additionally, the power consumption and signal strength of the node are taken into account. The complexity and extent of the network need the development of new types of smart grid communication. Finding a way to detect and thwart major assaults on routing protocols is another design challenge. Smart grids rely on these protocols in its data system for efficient interchange of renewable energy. A unique secure energy routing mechanism is developed in this proposed model for secure data communication.

In this context, Software Defined Networks (SDNs) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution with a programmable centralized controller for managing complex networks. This article aims to propose a Machine Learning-based Proactive Re-routing Scheme (MLPRS) that aims to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) by dynamic load balancing in real-time network topology. The proposed scheme applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify applications and assign flow priorities based on their type. The betweenness centrality algorithm is used to identify the importance of each link in the network, and the links are ordered in the betweenness set. The proposed method monitors the load on each link and if the critically important links are overloaded, then the flow is routed in real-time to avoid congestion. The idea of MLPRS has been simulated in Mininet with an OpenDaylight controller, and the results show that it effectively improves QoS and network performance. The MLPRS approach contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing intelligent and dynamic load-balancing techniques using machine learning algorithms. The performance of MLPRS has been improved by 3.7\u00a0% and 3.6\u00a0% in terms of Throughput and Bandwidth respectively when compared with the default SDN."}]}]}]}}}

Using fault-tolerant routing algorithm to reroute packets around faulty nodes will increase latency. Besides, the performance of NoC is heavily affected by network congestion. Congestion in the network increases the time to traverse a packet from a source to a destination.

The performance of wireless ad-hoc networks depend on the efficiency of routing protocols, especially the routing metric operating within it. In this paper, the performance of the recently proposed routing metric Interference Bandwidth Adjusted Expected transmission count (IBETX) metric is compared with two prominent existing metrics, the Expected transmission count (ETX) and the Inverse Expected Transmission count (InvETX) over the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. The performance differentials are analysed using varying packet rates and node densities. From the simulations results, IBETX metric outperforms the ETX and InvETX metric because it implements the bandwidth sharing mechanism and makes use of the information available at the MAC layer.

While numerous classic operations research solvers ensure optimal solutions, they often struggle with real-time dynamic objectives and environments, such as dynamic routing problems, which require periodic algorithmic recalibration. To deal with dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential with its capability as a self-learning and optimizing mechanism. However, the real-world applications of reinforcement learning are relatively limited due to lengthy training time and inefficiency in high-dimensional state spaces. In this study, we introduce two methods to enhance reinforcement learning for dynamic routing optimization. The first method involves transferring knowledge from classic operations research solvers to reinforcement learning during training, which accelerates exploration and reduces lengthy training time.

The optimal deployment of a UAV swarm, also known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET), to achieve on-demand coverage of mobile ground targets (MGTs) is challenging in terms of controlling UAV mobility to maximize coverage while maintaining quality of service. Data routing from UAVs to a base station (BS) without awareness of the updated topology causes link breakages, excessive retransmissions, high congestion, and energy holes. Therefore, we propose a joint topology control and routing (JTCR) protocol comprising three modules to perform crowd surveillance. The first JTCR module provides virtual force-based mobility control (VFMC), which controls the mobility of UAVs to track MGTs, ensuring stable bi-connectivity. The second module provides energy-efficient mobility-aware fuzzy clustering that clusters the FANET to aggregate the sensed data to each cluster head (CH) by utilizing the UAV mobility provided by the VFMC. The third module provides topology-aware Q-routing, which routes the aggregated data from CH UAVs to the BS by selecting an optimal path in terms of delay, path stability, and energy consumption. According to our performance study, the proposed JTCR outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of tracking-coverage rate, connectivity rate, the number of retransmissions, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. This is mainly enabled by the realistic mobility control of the UAV swarm at the reasonable cost of control overhead."}]}]}]}}}

In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput.

Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market. Under these circumstances, our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode. Therefore, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming.

Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) is one of the evolving technology to provide un-disrupted data connectivity to mobile users. It provides high bandwidth through efficient resource sharing, specially for areas deprived of wired connectivity. These networks also offer self-configuring, self-healing and self organizing capabilities. IEEE 802.11s is a MAC standard being proposed as an enhancement for WMN. This standard includes the use of a mandatory routing protocol at MAC layer, known as Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP). However, HWMP offers weak response to congestion, especially for interactive applications. IEEE 802.11s has also proposed sharing of Congestion Control Notification Frame(CCNF) on reaching congestion threshold. In this research paper, we have proposed a congestion avoidance technique named Congestion Avoidance Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (CA-HWMP). The proposed technique offers localized re-routing based upon congestion threshold, with minimal overheads. The re-routing decision is taken by the each node using CCNF received from the next hop neighbor. The proposed algorithm do not add any overhead as the CCNF is already the design part of 802.11s. This paper also shows comparison of proposed technique against HWMP under NS3 for the validation of proposed idea. From the comparison we concluded that use of CA-HWMP as replacement of HWMP significantly improves the performance of IEEE 802.11s."}]}]}]}}}

But traffic filtering and traffic analysis are costly activities for the limited resources of mesh nodes, so a trade-off must be reached limiting the number of nodes that enforce them. This work shows how, using the OLSR protocol, the centrality of groups of nodes with reference to traffic can be estimated with high accuracy independently of the network topology or size.

However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %."}]}]}]}}}

This paper addresses the challenges related to coverage range in outdoor monitoring systems utilizing LoRa, where the network performance is affected by the density of gateways (GWs) and end devices (EDs), as well as environmental conditions. To mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption, the proposed spreading factor (SF) and hybrid (data rate|SF) models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters. The orchestration of concurrent data modifications within the network server (NS) is crucial for uninterrupted communication between GWs and EDs, especially in monitoring electric vehicle (EV) stations to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Employing K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms optimizes ED allocation, averts data congestion, and improves the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR). These methods ensure seamless information reception by meticulously allocated EDs across various GW combinations. To estimate the free-space losses (FSL), a log-distance path loss model (log-PL) is used. Exploring various bandwidths (BWs), bidirectional communications, and duty cycles (DCs) helps to prevent saturation, thus prolonging the operational lifespan of EDs. Empirical findings reveal a notable packet rejection rate (PRR) of 0% for the DBSCAN (hybrid model). In contrast, the K-means exhibits a PRR ranging from 5% (hybrid model) to 35.29% (SF model) for the ten GWs combination. Notably, the network saturation is reduced to 10.185% and 9.503%, respectively, highlighting an improvement in the average efficiency of slotted ALOHA (91.1%) and pure ALOHA (90.7%).

The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved."}]}]}]}}}

Operating in challenging environments with stringent computational and power constraints within human vascular systems, these nanonetworks face significant hurdles. Successful transmissions between in-body nanonodes and on-body nanorouters are infrequent, requiring novel approaches to enhance network throughput under such circumstances. Traditional flow-guided nanonetworks rely on nanonodes to transmit packets if they possess sufficient energy, irrespective of their proximity to the nanorouter. In this paper, we present an extended model for legacy flow-guided nanonetworks that offers substantial throughput improvements while reducing the required number of nanonodes compared to the baseline blind transmission approach. By allocating transmission energy to allow more than one transmission during a charging cycle, our proposed model significantly enhances network throughput, facilitating the deployment of nanocommunication-supported medical applications. For example, with only two transmissions, it is possible to increase throughput by around 46% with the same number of nanonodes or, equivalently, reduce the number of nanonodes by the same amount to achieve the same throughput."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e1947", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1948"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1950", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1951", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e1955", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S2542660524000799/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1956", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1957"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1959", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1960", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1962"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1963"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1966", "view": "all"}, "_": "Transmission power allocation in flow-guided nanonetworks increases transmission throughput."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1968"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1971", "view": "all"}, "_": "Transmission power allocation in flow-guided nanonetworks allows the definition of enhanced nanomedical applications."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1973"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1976", "view": "all"}, "_": "Legacy flow-guided nanocommunication networks performance gets significantly improved through transmission power allocation."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

This study addresses the critical challenge of cell scheduling within TSCH MAC, emphasising the importance of selecting scheduling mechanisms based on application-specific quality of service parameters. Despite numerous proposals and evaluations, the lack of standardised scheduling methods and comprehensive performance metrics remains a significant obstacle. Traditional network metrics often fail to capture key issues in TSCH-based mesh networks, potentially overlooking indicators of network stability. To address this gap, we examine both application and network metrics from a mesh network perspective and propose a set of complementary metrics tailored to the characteristics of TSCH. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of how scheduling impacts network reliability and efficiency. Given the diverse applications and configurations in industrial environments, this study offers insights into employing these complementary metrics for a more accurate assessment of the impact of TSCH scheduling. Ultimately, our approach aims to improve TSCH scheduling evaluation and contribute to advancing industrial wireless communication systems."}]}]}]}}}

The resiliency is the network's ability to survive against attacks and other component failures. This paper focuses on a comparison of different data forwarding algorithms currently supported by the POX standards for protection and restoration. Understanding existing approaches or standards in SDN plays a crucial role in network resiliency or protection and restoration. We also provide the extension of one of the components in POX for improvement.

The optimal and sub-optimal lightpaths are found by the ants (control agents) depending upon the number of free wavelengths available, the length of the lightpath (hop count) and number of conversion required from source to destination. When a connection request arrives at a node, the high speed data are routed through the readily available optimal lightpath thereby reducing the processing time. The low speed data are first tried to groom over the existing low speed data, else routed through the readily available lightpath. As opposed to the reactive protocols, our proposed protocol is proactive in the sense that it proactively updates the changes in the network status using the concept of ant colony optimization. Further for survivability backup lightpath is maintained. The selection of backup lightpath is done in such a way that there is no shared link between the primary and backup lightpath but it can be shared with another backup lightpath.

By conducting route searches based on each user's data, we calculated the traffic volume for each mode of transportation, linking the estimated population data to network data and confirming accuracy against official census data. In August 2019, we examined the relationship between the estimated transportation modes and the hourly wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which was calculated by the Ministry of the Environment using values measured by the Tokyo Regional Meteorological Observatory. The results indicated that as WBGT increases, fewer pedestrians walk and more remain stationary. Sensitivity to WBGT was four times greater at 20:00 p.m. than at 08:00 a.m., despite similar WBGT levels. This may be because fewer people go out during the hottest part of the day, and the sum of those who go out during the day, i.e., those who return home, is greatly reduced. However, this trend was not observed on weekdays. The results suggest that the impact of summer heat is latent during weekdays due to the demands of work and errands but becomes more pronounced during free time, such as holidays and nighttime."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Proposed methodology can extract highly detailed modes of human transportation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Pedestrian responses to weather based on land use and time of day were estimated."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "High WBGT leads to decreased walking activity, especially on holidays."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Reduction in pedestrian numbers due to WBGT rise is greater at night than in morning."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}}

In this approach routing algorithms are mapped (or programmed) onto a set of bit-patterns that are matched in parallel. To show the applicability of this router, we have selected oblivious and fault-tolerant routing algorithms for ten different tree interconnection network topologies; however, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to accommodate other network topologies and routing algorithms. For the studied topologies, the number of required bit-patterns is of the same order as the topology degree. The proposed organization requires only one comparison and one read delays. This in turn yields a high-speed port assignment that is comparable to single topology routers (non-flexible routers). In the context of flexible router schemes, the proposed approach not only is one of the fastest but also requires a very small amount of hardware for its implementation."}]}]}]}}}

The constant need to increase economic feasibility, energy efficiency and safety while complying with emission regulations motivates further developments and improvements in voyage optimization and weather routing systems. These systems optimize a voyage based on meteorological and oceanographic information taking into account ship characteristics and routing information. The quality of the provided route not only depends on the quality of this data, but also on the modeling of the optimization problem and the algorithm chosen to solve it. Due to the wide range of mathematical approaches and consequently challenges in decision making, this paper aims to give a comprehensive and comparative overview of the existing state-of-the-art methods by a thorough literature review and elaboration of different modeling approaches, optimization algorithms, and their application in weather routing systems. The research shows that approaches range from modeling the weather routing problem as a constrained graph problem, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem or as combination of both. Based on the formulation of the ship weather routing optimization problem different methods are used to solve it ranging from Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programing and optimal control methods to isochrone methods or iterative approaches for solving nonlinear optimization problems. However, it can be concluded that the determination whether an approach is suitable, produces sufficient results and may be recommended, strongly depends on the specific requirements concerning optimization objectives, control variables and constraints as well as the implementation."}]}]}]}}}

Although the proposed methods can mitigate the problem of rapid battery depletion to some extent, the lifespan of sensor nodes is still a biggest constraint. Many studies conducted so far have shown continuous network functions with the help of external harvesting techniques. However, these provide low output because of the limitation on the energy capturing devices. Therefore, energy limitation strongly restricts the usage of wireless sensor nodes. This paper aims to provide high recharging rates and better energy efficiency by proposing a three-step mechanism, which is an extension of our existing proposed work J-ERLB (Joint Energy Replenishment and Load Balancing). In a three-step mechanism, topology selection followed by recharging and load balancing are combined together to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes. Topology selection is performed by implementing J-ERLB on various topologies like ring, star, and cluster. Further, taking advantage of Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) we focus on data collection and high-rate recharging. We have implemented System on Chip (SoC) integrated chip on UAV to achieve goal of perpetual network operations. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed mechanism is tested by comparing its numerical outcomes with existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG (Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering) techniques. The overall throughput for 3SM is doubled in comparison with the existing techniques, whereas the average remaining energy shows 6 times better savings for the proposed solution in comparison to the existing J-ERLB and J-MERDG when varying data rates is applied."}]}]}]}}}

Energy conservation is one of the main constraints, and the traditional IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (IPv6-NDP) was neither designed nor suitable to cope with it. This inefficiency arises from non-transitive wireless links and heavy multicast transmission, sometimes rendering it impractical in LLNs. Substantial work has been done by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to optimize the IPv6-ND protocol, known as IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network - Neighbor Discovery Protocol (6LoWPAN-NDP). Despite these improvements, full implementation is yet to be achieved in commercial, open-source, or proprietary sectors. In this article, we debate both Neighbor Discovery Protocols (NDPs), examining various aspects. We implemented 6LoWPAN-NDP in a well-known ns3 simulator. We discuss the complexity of 6LoWPAN-NDP and see why open-source, commercial, or proprietary sectors have not widely adopted it. We present how both protocols function optimally in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios. We present results and analysis of both NDPs control messages\u2019 behavior. At the same time, data traffic is turned on and off, and we demonstrate the operational behavior of Link-local Unicast Address (LUA) and Global Unicast Address (GUA) in meshunder and non-meshunder scenarios.

This paper proposes Flooding Factor based Framework for Trust Management (F3TM) in MANETs. True flooding approach is utilized to identify attacker nodes based on the calculation of trust value. Route Discovery Algorithm is developed to discover an efficient and secure path for data forwarding using Experimental Grey Wolf algorithm for validating network nodes. Enhanced Multi-Swarm Optimization is used to optimize the identified delivery path. Simulations are carried out in ns2 to assess and compare the performance of F3TM with the state-of-the-art frameworks: CORMAN and PRIME considering the metrics including delay, packet delivery ration, overhead and throughput. The performance assessment attests the reliable security of F3TM compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks."}]}]}]}}}

In that way, users determine their transmit power and data rate based on their local observations (coupled interference). Pricing mechanism is employed in PRIM to restrict users from self-interest behaviours. It is demonstrated theoretically that PRIM satisfies the conditions of the super-modular games such that the local optimality is always the global optimality.

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail.

There are two main requirements, which we consider for the communication design. First, the communication shall be wireless in order to reduce the effort for changing the factory structure. Second, the communication strategy shall allow an easy identification of the current factory layout and the interconnection of factory resources.

The abundant spectrum available in such ultra high frequencies has the potential to increase network capacity to huge data rates. However, they are extremely affected by blockages, to the point of disrupting ongoing communications. In this paper, we elaborate on the relevance of predicting visibility between users and access points (APs) to improve the performance of THz-based networks by minimizing blockages, that is, maximizing network availability, while at the same time keeping a low reconfiguration overhead. We propose a novel approach to address this problem, by combining a neural network (NN) for predicting future user\u2013AP visibility probability, with a probability threshold for AP reselection to avoid unnecessary reconfigurations.

This scheme is performed at both sides of communication: (1) LoRa nodes are designed to sleep periodically to save more power; (2) LoRa gateway must send packets with long preamble to maintain the reliability of downlink communication. In addition, an energy model is built to prove that an optimal cycle period exists for LoRa nodes to save more energy.

However, one of the main issues yet to be solved is how it scales with an increasing number of Wi-Fi devices injecting location-specific traffic in the shared medium. While the recently released IEEE 802.11az standard will still take time before being integrated in COTS devices, this paper aims at assessing the impact of the burst size on the ranging performance of COTS Wi-Fi Android devices running release 12. While increasing the burst size is expected to bring higher stability in the observed distance, on the other hand a longer transmission period for location-only purposes may jeopardize the transmission of data traffic among Wi-Fi users. Several models of smartphones and APs, and different frequency bands, have been considered in order to evaluate the behavior of the FTM procedure in real devices, showing that not always the newest or most expensive ones perform better. Also, it is shown that using the minimum burst size significantly decreases the performance and it is thus not recommended. While bursts longer than 8 may no be always supported by all the models and/or frequency bands, the small improvements in ranging estimations obtained when they are used do not always justify the increased location traffic injected in the network."}]}]}]}}}

We consider two complete DisCSP algorithms: asynchronous backtracking (ABT) and asynchronous weak commitment search (AWC), and perform performance comparison for these algorithms on both satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances of SensorDCSP. We found that random delays (due to network traffic or in some cases actively introduced by the agents) combined with a dynamic decentralized restart strategy can improve the performance of DisCSP algorithms. In addition, we introduce GSensorDCSP, a plain-embedded version of SensorDCSP that is closely related to various real-life dynamic tracking systems.

In TS-VP-LoRa, scheduling is coordinated by the LoRa gateway, broadcasting beacon frames periodically for the synchronization of LoRa end-devices.

The sensitivity of the applications requires adaptive; efficient; delay bounded and scalable communication network among UAVs for data transmission. Due to communication protocol complexity; rigidity; cost of commercial-off-the-shelf (COT) components; limited radio bandwidth; high mobility and computational resources; maintaining the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a daunting task. For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays. Moreover analysis ad-hoc routing protocols including two proactive (OLSR, DSDV) and one reactive (AODV) is also presented. The results shows that the proposed scheme guarantees high packet delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of latency requirements comparable with more complex and dedicatedly designed protocols in literature."}]}]}]}}}

Through analyzing and comparing with DSR, TORA, ABR, AODV, it researched on-demand routing protocol for Ad Hoc networks. It introduces AODV routing protocol in details. It presents an optimized protocol: B-AODV, based on the shortage of routing finding and routing repair of AODV. In B-AODV, first through reverse request by sending BRREQ replace of RREP, it reduces the time of routing finding. Second, two hops IP record in control messages and route table can improve the rate of routing repair and reduces the times of routing findings. And it improves the function of Ad Hoc network. This simulation experiment is based on NS2 and compared the performance of AODV and B-AODV. And it compared the differences of control packets, ratio of packets, end to end delay for AODV and B- AODV. It shows that B-AODV is better than AODV."}]}]}]}}}
