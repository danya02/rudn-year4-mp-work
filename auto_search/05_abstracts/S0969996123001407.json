In these aggregates, Tau is modified by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation as well as by proteolytic cleavage. Here we identify a novel Tau cleavage site at aspartate 65 (D65) that is specific for caspase-2. In addition, we show that the previously described cleavage site at D421 is also efficiently processed by caspase-2, and both sites are cleaved in human brain samples.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that caspase-2 cleavage significantly improves the recognition of Tau by the ubiquitin E3 ligase CHIP, leading to increased ubiquitination and faster degradation of Tau fragments. Taken together our data thus suggest that CHIP-induced ubiquitination is of particular importance for the clearance of caspase-2 generated Tau fragments "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vitro"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vivo"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0075", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Caspase-2 cleaves Tau at D65 and D421."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "In vivo"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " overexpression leads to low steady-state protein levels for caspase-2 generated Tau fragments."}]}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "CHIP specifically co-immunoprecipitates with Tau fragments "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vivo"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Caspase-2 generated Tau fragments are preferentially ubiquitinated by CHIP."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "CHIP is linked to accelerated degradation of caspase-2 generated Tau fragments "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vitro"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
