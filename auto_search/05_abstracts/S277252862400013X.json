The proposed methodology, Epilepsy Tracking META-Set Analysis, establishes portability rules that identify similar patients, enabling the transfer of these detection models from one patient to another. Main issue is to identify clusters of patients analyzing a set of meta-features of each patient in terms of clinical descriptors, performance metrics of a machine learning model for seizure detection, and data complexity measures. The investigation of complexity measures represents a novelty in such a medical field, allowing to compare patients and to support automated seizure detection methods. The proposed methodology is validated using the well-known Epileptic Seizure EEG Database from the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg and demonstrates promising results in transferring detection models to new cases."}]}]}]}}
