A sketch based system is an efficient method which does not require the user to have a high skill to draw the query sketch. Sketch-to-image matching system on a large-scale image database should ensure that the system always tries to find correct matches for a given sketch query. In this paper, we present an efficient method for image retrieval from large database using sketch as a query image. Features are extracted from the image by placing a non-overlapping grid and overlapping grid over the image, respectively. Using a weighted similarity approach, the most similar images to the query are then retrieved from the image dataset. For performing experiments images of flickr15k dataset are used. The proposed method shows excellent retrieval performance in comparison to methods available in the literature."}]}]}]}}
