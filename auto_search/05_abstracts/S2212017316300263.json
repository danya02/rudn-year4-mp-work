In developed system, data is sent from the transmitter node to the receiver node through a customized hopping method. The data received at the receiver node is monitored and recorded in an excel sheet in a personal computer (PC) through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), made in LabVIEW. An Android application has also been developed through which data is transferred from LabVIEW to a smartphone through which data is remotely monitored."}]}]}]}}
