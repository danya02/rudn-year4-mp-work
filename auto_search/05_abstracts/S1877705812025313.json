The two possible techniques of localization, namely the RSSI based and the hop count based, were investigated. For RSSI based technique, the principle and methodology was presented. The experiment was carried out to investigate the performance between the RSS and hop count technique. A set of nesC programme was designed to review the structural requirement. The performance analyses of both techniques in localization were investigated."}]}]}]}}
