In order to minimize the interferences caused by TDoA in WMNs, the optimal starting point of FFT window at the receiver side of a node is derived by maximizing the effective SINR for each subcarrier. Also, a signal detection technique, called two dimensional ordered successive interference cancellation (TD-OSIC), is proposed for WMNs with TDoAs. It was shown via simulation that the proposed technique can achieve effective SINR and BER performances similar to the ideal case (no TDoA), even in WMNs with large TDoAs."}]}]}]}}
