In this paper, we focus on rooted, unordered, uniquely-labelled trees such as taxonomies and other hierarchies. For trees as these, we introduce the intuitive concept of a \u2018local move\u2019 operation as an atomic edit of a tree. We then introduce SuMoTED, a new edit distance measure between such trees, defined as the minimal number of local moves required to convert one tree into another. We show how SuMoTED can be computed using a scalable algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Finally, we demonstrate its use on a collection of music genre taxonomies."}]}]}]}}
