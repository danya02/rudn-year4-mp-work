In this paper, we first delve into the representation learning of deep hashing and surprisingly find that deep hashing could be a double-edged sword, "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "i.e."}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", deep hashing can accelerate the query speed and decrease the storage cost in the nearest neighbor search progress, but it greatly sacrifices the discriminability of deep representations especially with extremely short target code lengths. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step deep hashing learning framework. The first step focuses on learning deep discriminative representations with metric learning. Subsequently, the learning framework concentrates on simultaneously learning compact binary codes and preserving representations learned in the former step from being sacrificed. Extensive experiments on two general image datasets and four challenging image datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework. Moreover, the side effect of deep hashing is successfully mitigated with our learning framework."}]}]}]}]}}
