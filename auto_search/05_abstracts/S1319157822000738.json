However, the short voyaging reach and the lack of charging lattice have impeded the large-scale application of EVs. A choice of a particular route for EV is largely dependent on the availability of charging stations on that route as well as the ease of charging facility offered by the charging station (including state of the charging station, user convenience, etc.). Hence, it is vital to delve into the challenge of locating a charging station that offers the utmost user convenience in charging EVs. This paper attempts to present a solution to this very problem.

This distributed architecture employs the proposed agile charging slot reservation approach for the EVs that wish to get recharged at a particular charging station. Besides, to delineate the interactive mechanism of EVs recharging, three non-identical objective functions are formulated to minimize the overall energy consumption of EVs, waiting time at charging station, and total charging expenditure.
