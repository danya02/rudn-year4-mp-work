Continued progress in this field of medicine will require (1) improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of neural control over organ function and (2) advances in technologies for precisely modulating these functions in a programmable manner. This review presents recent research on devices that are relevant to both of these goals, with an emphasis on multimodal operation, miniaturized dimensions, biocompatible designs, advanced neural interface schemes, and battery-free, wireless capabilities. A future that involves recording and modulating neural activity with such systems, including those that exploit closed-loop strategies and/or bioresorbable designs, seems increasingly within reach."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Rogers and colleagues review the advances in developing implantable devices to control neural activity, summarizing the major modes of modulation, sensing, and operation.
