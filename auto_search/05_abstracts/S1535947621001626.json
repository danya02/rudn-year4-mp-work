Still, not much is known about the fetal mechanisms that predispose these individuals to disease. Using a previously validated mouse model of fetal hypoxia and bottom-up proteomics, we characterize the response of the fetal kidney to chronic hypoxic stress. Fetal kidneys exhibit a dichotomous response to chronic hypoxia, comprising on the one hand cellular adaptations that promote survival (glycolysis, autophagy, and reduced DNA and protein synthesis), but on the other processes that induce a senescence-like phenotype (infiltration of inflammatory cells, DNA damage, and reduced proliferation). Importantly, chronic hypoxia also reduces the expression of the antiaging proteins klotho and Sirt6, a mechanism that is evolutionary conserved between mice and humans. Taken together, we uncover that predetermined aging during fetal development is a key event in chronic hypoxia, establishing a solid foundation for Barker\u2019s hypothesis of fetal programming of adult diseases. This phenotype is associated with a characteristic biomarker profile in tissue and serum samples, exploitable for detecting and targeting accelerated aging in chronic hypoxic human diseases."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical Abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S1535947621001626/fx1", "id": "aep-link-id10"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Chronic fetal hypoxia induces widespread changes in protein expression."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Repressed replication and translation constrain the formation of new nephrons."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Multiple pathways predetermine an aging phenotype already during development."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Synergy of inflammatory damage, ineffective repair, and altered metabolism."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "Reduced abundance of antiaging proteins klotho and sirtuin 6 in mice and humans."}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0025"}, "_": "In Brief"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Using bottom-up proteomics and the kidney as a paradigm, we report an integrative perspective of the cellular responses to chronic fetal hypoxia, uncovering fundamental mechanisms of the fetal programming of adult diseases theory that are principally applicable to all other organs in the body.
