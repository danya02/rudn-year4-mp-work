The cross-system analysis of collaborative work is challenging because of the nature of the log files that are stored in heterogeneous formats and at different levels of log granularity. These challenges cannot easily be overcome with the help of existing approaches for data preprocessing. In this paper, approaches and frameworks for data mining, data preprocessing and SCA are adapted to design a special method for "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Social"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " Process Mining (SPM).
