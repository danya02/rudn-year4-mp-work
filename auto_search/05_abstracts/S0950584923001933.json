Regarding RQ2 we found that bug reports and source code are the typical data sources of bug reproduction and localization. Also, most studies include experiments with historical data but do not investigate ongoing projects. Regarding RQ3 we found that many studies adapt or combine existing approaches for bug reproduction and localization to improve their accuracy or applicability (e.g., combine requirements-related information and bug reports to increase information-retrieval-based techniques). Regarding RQ4 we found that existing solutions for bug reproduction and localization have rarely been integrated into the workflow of developers."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e964", "role": "conclusion", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e965"}, "_": "Conclusion:"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e967", "view": "all"}, "_": "Although bug reproduction and localization have been studied in quite some detail, new challenges and gaps emerge due to the evolution of software technologies and practices and the practical needs of software developers.
