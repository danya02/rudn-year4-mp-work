Despite notable progress, several inadequacies still persist in the field of Pdots, including the development of simplified near-infrared (NIR) optical nanoprobes, elucidation of their inherent biological behavior, and integration of information processing and nanotechnology into biomedical applications. This review aims to comprehensively elucidate the current status of Pdots as a classical nanophotonic material by discussing its advantages and limitations in terms of biocompatibility, adaptability to microenvironments in vivo, etc. Multifunctional integration and surface chemistry play crucial roles in realizing the intelligent application of Pdots. Information visualization based on their optical and physicochemical properties is pivotal for achieving detection, sensing, and labeling probes. Therefore, we have refined the underlying mechanisms and constructed multiple comprehensive original mechanism summaries to establish a benchmark. Additionally, we have explored the cross-linking interactions between Pdots and nanomedicine, potential yet complete biological metabolic pathways, future research directions, and innovative solutions for integrating diagnosis and treatment strategies. This review presents the possible expectations and valuable insights for advancing Pdots, specifically from chemical, medical, and photophysical practitioners\u2019 standpoints."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "caption", "$": {"id": "pc_zsMeFRYfsU"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "fspara0065", "view": "all"}, "_": "We summarize the situation of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) in the field of classical nanophotonic materials, discuss the development and application progress of functionalized designs based on substrate detection purposes, and the development of diagnosis and treatment integrated nanotechnology platforms for biomedical applications.
