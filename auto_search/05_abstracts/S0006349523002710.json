However, using multiple F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors together is challenging due to toxicity and the need for orthogonal fluorophores. Here we generate a biosensor component that binds selectively to the activated conformation of three different proteins. This enabled multiplexed FRET with fewer fluorophores, and reduced toxicity. We generated this MultiBinder (MB) reagent for the GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by combining portions of the downstream effector proteins Pak1 and Rhotekin. Using FRET between mCherry on the MB and YPet or mAmetrine on two target proteins, the activities of any pair of GTPases could be distinguished. The MB was used to image Rac1 and RhoA together with a third, dye-based biosensor for Cdc42. Quantifying effects of biosensor combinations on the frequency, duration, and velocity of cell protrusions and retractions demonstrated reduced toxicity. Multiplexed imaging revealed signaling hierarchies between the three proteins at the cell edge where they regulate motility."}]}]}]}}
