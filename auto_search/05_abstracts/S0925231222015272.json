Kinship verification is an important research field in computer vision with many applications such as finding missing persons, family album organization, and online image search. Although substantial progress has been made in kinship verification in the past decade, there are still challenges such as intrinsic (face "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "i.e."}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", differences in facial appearance) and extrinsic (acquisition "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "i.e."}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", varying imaging conditions) problems.

The survey starts with the definition of kinship verification and its corresponding intrinsic and extrinsic challenges. Then, an overview of kinship verification methods and datasets is given. Finally, a new multi-modal dataset (Nemo-Kinship Dataset) is proposed as a benchmark dataset addressing large inter-subject age variations consisting of 4216 videos of 248 persons from 85 families. The newly collected dataset is used to systematically test and analyze state-of-the-art methods."}]}]}]}}
