This paper discusses the efficient process monitoring of pipelines that carry oil, gas, water, and other important resources for an essential infrastructures. A Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) should be designed to obtain maximum throughput of data to efficiently monitor the health condition of the system and obtain timeliness for handling critical events in case of emergency. A real-time Multichannel Process Control Monitoring System is designed to monitor and control large network. For any real time system timeliness and throughput are equally important but are obtained on the compromise of each other. This paper proposes a Multichannel Process Monitoring Algorithm (MPMA) which brings a balance between timeliness and throughput by increasing in number of operating channels. The protocol has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on a testbed using nodes with standard IEEE 802.15.4. It has been observed that the proposed algorithm has shown an increase in timeliness and throughput compared with the standard algorithm."}]}]}]}}
