These data happen to be very useful to transport planners, because of the valuable spatial and temporal information they contain. This paper is a synthesis of a workshop on passive data streams held in Australia in November 2014. Many issues are discussed here: definitions, data collection and processing, privacy, how to use these data for transport planning, how to integrate these data with traditional and more \u201cactive\u201d data sources, such as household travel surveys that respondents are explicitly asked to participate in, and how to cope with the absence of socio-demographic attributes in passive data streams."}]}]}]}}
