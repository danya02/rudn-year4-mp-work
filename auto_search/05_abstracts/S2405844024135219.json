Communication networks are advancing, as well as logistics networks, or even networks for the transportation and distribution of natural resources. One of the key benefits of the evolution of these networks is to bring consumers closer to the source of a resource or service. However, this is not a straightforward task, particularly since networks near final users are usually shaped by heterogeneous nodes, sometimes even in very dense scenarios, which may demand or offer a resource at any given moment. In this paper, we present DEN2NE, a novel algorithm designed for the automatic distribution and reallocation of resources in distributed environments. The algorithm has been implemented with six different criteria in order to adapt it to the specific use case under consideration. The results obtained from DEN2DE are promising, owing to its adaptability and its average execution time, which follows a linear distribution in relation to the topology size."}]}]}]}}
