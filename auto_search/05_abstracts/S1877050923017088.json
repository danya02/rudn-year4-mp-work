Additionally, it has substantial applications in many fields, including healthcare, security, entertainment, and education. There are a lot of techniques to estimate age, but the most popular one is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which offers high accuracy but needs a lot of training time and much more labeled data to achieve it. Another popular technique is transfer learning with feature extraction, which can provide higher accuracy with faster training time because it uses a pre-trained model rather than building one from scratch but has limited flexibility and a substantial risk of overfitting. Due to the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, this study analyzes and compares the effectiveness of transfer learning and CNN methods for age estimation from facial images. Using R-squared and RMSE as test metrics, the results show that the CNN method offers a better process and accuracy than the transfer learning method, with a higher R-squared value and a lower RMSE value."}]}]}]}}
