This practice, however, is hindered by the large quantity of collected opinions which are often overloading and hard to value. This is referred to as information overload. As a way to mitigate this challenge for policy-makers, this article develops a prioritization framework for citizens\u2019 ideas collected through e-participation. The framework builds on Design Science Research and is validated on a real-world case in collaboration with the European Commission. The resulting contributions are threefold. First, theoretical criteria, popularity and polarization, are developed to prioritize citizens\u2019 proposals. Then, automated and quantitative metrics are proposed to measure these criteria. Finally, a prioritization matrix is developed to visually assess the relative priority of these citizens\u2019 proposals."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e366", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e367"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e369", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e370", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e372"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e373"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e376", "view": "all"}, "_": "Information Overload is a problem for e-participation data analytics."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e378"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e381", "view": "all"}, "_": "Design Science Research is used to build a Data-Driven Prioritization Framework."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e383"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e386", "view": "all"}, "_": "Quantitative and automated metrics are proposed to produce a prioritization matrix."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e388"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e391", "view": "all"}, "_": "This matrix is based on two dimensions: polarization and popularity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e393"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e396", "view": "all"}, "_": "The framework is validated in collaboration with the European Commission."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
