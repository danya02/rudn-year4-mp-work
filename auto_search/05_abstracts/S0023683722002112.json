Working with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMAC), we undertook a validation study, assessing concordance across a dozen serial sections of a tissue microarray of 21 samples that were independently processed and imaged by MIBI-TOF or single-plex immunohistochemistry (IHC) over 12 days. Pixel-level features were highly concordant across all 16 targets assessed in both staining intensity ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "R"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "2"}]}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " = 0.94 \u00b1 0.04) and frequency ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "R"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "2"}]}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " = 0.95 \u00b1 0.04).
