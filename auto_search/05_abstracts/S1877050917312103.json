With the proposed method, it is possible to predict user satisfaction of a product, happiness with some particular environment or destroy situation after disasters. Recently, deep learning is able to solve problems in computer vision or voice recognition, and convolutional neural network (CNN) works good for image analysis and image classification. The biggest reason to adopt CNN in image analysis and classification is due to CNN can extract an area of features from global information, and it is able to consider the relationship among these features. The above solution can achieve a higher accuracy in analysis and classification. For natural language processing, texts data features also can be extracted piece by piece and to consider the relationship among these features, but without the consideration of context or whole sentence, the sentiment might be understood wrong. And currently, convolutional neural network is one of the most effective methods to do image classification, CNN has a convolutional layer to extract information by a larger piece of text, so we work for sentiment analysis with convolutional neural network, and we design a simple convolutional neural network model and test it on benchmark, the result shows that it achieves better accuracy performance in twitter sentiment classification than some of traditional method such as the SVM and Naive Bayes methods."}]}]}]}}
