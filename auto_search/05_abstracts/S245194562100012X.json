The phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries not only represents an attractive approach to identify compounds that may serve as drug leads but also serves as an opportunity to uncover compounds with novel mechanisms of action (MoAs). However, a major bottleneck of phenotypic screens continues to be the ID of pharmacologically relevant target(s) for compounds of interest. The field of chemoproteomics aims to map proteome-wide small-molecule interactions in complex, native systems, and has proved a key technology to unravel the protein targets of pharmacological modulators. In this review, we discuss the application of modern chemoproteomic methods to identify protein targets of phenotypic screening hits and investigate MoAs, with a specific focus on the development of chemoproteomic-enabled compound libraries to streamline target discovery."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "href": "pii:S245194562100012X/fx1", "type": "simple", "id": "aep-link-id3"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Phenotypic screening is a powerful approach in drug discovery; however, target identification (ID) remains a significant hurdle.
