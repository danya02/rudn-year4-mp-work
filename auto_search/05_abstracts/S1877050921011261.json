The sensor platform under development allows traditional electrochemical techniques to be executed with a low Size, Weight, and Power (low SWaP) system that is deployable using an autonomous or remote-controlled vehicle. Once in the field, the sensors communicate target chemical concentrations to a centralized gateway through LoRa to an Internet of Things (IoT) network. Researchers are currently deploying the prototype network for field testing of each node\u2019s sensing, meshing, and communication capabilities throughout all weather climates. Developing a robust and dynamic sensor network to monitor the environment and provide a live data feed to detect chemicals of interest in the environment eliminates the need for direct human interaction. The low power consumption of LoRa allows the network nodes to be deployed for an extended amount of time on a single battery supply."}]}]}]}}
