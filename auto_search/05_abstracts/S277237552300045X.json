Considering this kind of need, this paper aims to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart drip irrigation system by applying Web/Android applications that will provide a solution for continuous monitoring and controlling the drip irrigation system to avoid the problems of constant human vigilance and waste of water. It also facilitates prevention by giving automatic water to plants relying on water necessities. It can also convince be capable in Agricultural fields, Parks, Lawns, etc. With the advancement of technology, there are always reducing risks and making work simpler. The embedded system provides a solution for solving this kind of problem. In this paper, a smart drip irrigation system is established which is driven by IoT and web-based applications. The web application is also designed for taking appropriate action for the user during drip irrigation. This application provides the appropriate amount of water from the pump for gardening. It can be accomplished by incorporating different sensors within the system to observe the humidity, temperature, and soil moisture conditions which transmit the data to the micro-controller for proper estimating the water needs of the plants. This kind of system can be controlled and visualized in the android mobile phone through a web application anywhere."}]}]}]}}
