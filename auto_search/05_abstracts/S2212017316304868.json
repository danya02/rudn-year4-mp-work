Our solution contains two types of nodes Wireless Sensor Node and Border Router/Gateway Node. Wireless Sensor Node: These nodes have sensors integrated and are used to gather the information and send to the Border Router/Gateway Node. They create a mesh network among them, forwarding the packets of other nodes in order to make the information reach the Border Router/Gateway Node. Each Wireless Sensor Node is equipped with a 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio, sensors and a battery. It can be either a microcontroller based or Linux based embedded platforms. Border Router/Gateway Node: This node takes the information sent by the Wireless Sensor Nodes and sends it to the Tunneling IPv4 / IPv6 server by using the Ethernet IPv4 interface. Each Border Router/Gateway Node is equipped with a Linux based Single Board Computer, 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio and an Ethernet interface and a battery."}]}]}]}}
