Additionally, immobilized enzyme particle (IEP) fabrication and digestion within the 96-well plate allows for flexibility in protocol where different enzyme-coupler combinations can be employed simultaneously. By enabling the digestion of entire microplates and reducing manual labor, the proposed method enhances reproducibility and offers a more efficient alternative to classical in-gel techniques. Furthermore, pepsin IEPs were noted to favor cleavage at leucine residues which represents an interesting finding when compared to the literature that warrants further study. The capability of immobilized enzyme microreactors (IMER) for rapid digestion (in as little as 15\u00a0min) demonstrated the system's efficiency and potential for rapid proteomic analysis. This advancement in BUP not only improves efficiency, but also opens avenues for a fully automated, mass spectrometry-integrated proteomics workflow, promising to expedite research and discoveries in complex biological studies."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0050", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0040"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0040"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0040", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S1874391924001477/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0055", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Utilized silicon-based molecules as novel enzyme coupling agents."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Developed an automated liquid handling method for proteomics using an Agilent Bravo."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Trypsin IEPs achieved comparable results to in-gel while being faster and automatable."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Pepsin IEPs favored cleavage at Leu (>50%) over Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Met residues."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Demonstrated the potential of IMERs for 15-min high-throughput digestions."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
