The standardized protocols and existing algorithms for path attributes and service level agreement parameters negotiation are studied in this paper and shortcomings of each are identified. A thorough study of the priority-aware and service level agreement based mechanisms including the existing mechanisms, their advantages and disadvantages, and the remedy for the shortcomings is provided. The mathematical models for availability analysis of different routing mechanisms, protection schemes, and network resources are discussed. Different routing strategies and wavelength assignment approaches are studied as well."}]}]}]}}
