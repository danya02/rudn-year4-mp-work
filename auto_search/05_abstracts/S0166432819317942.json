Thereby, the evolution of the human NGI behaviourome underlies similar features as genetically based evolution. However, specific mechanisms of mutation and selection work largely independent (orthogonal) from genetic/epigenetic mechanisms. We suggest a mechanism of how adaptive changes (mutations) in the NGI behaviourome work target-directed and how selection works on an ultra-fast time scale. Selection results are mostly not fatal for the individual which allows for a much increased mutation rate.

Altogether, this model of human behavioural reproduction and accumulation of behaviour may provide a base for better understanding and prediction of uniquely human cultural development."}]}]}]}]}}
