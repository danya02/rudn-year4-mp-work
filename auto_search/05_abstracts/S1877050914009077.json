As sensor nodes used in most of the applications are generally battery-powered devices, the challenges focus on how to increase the lifetime of each sensor node and how to reduce the energy consumption of each node, so that the network energy efficiency (EE) can be maintained to deliver the data for a reasonable time. In this paper, we analyze to enhance the energy conservation approach which reduces the energy consumption, cost and complexity. In this research, combination of routing and solar power is analyzed as enhancement of energy conservation technology (EECT) which increases the lifetime of the sensor node as well as the battery. Even though, solar power concept is not new for the WSN, EECT can be used for where some selected applications such as monitoring air condition in large organizations are directly involved with the sun light and heat."}]}]}]}}
