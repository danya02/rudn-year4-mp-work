Ribosome profiling recently revealed that many short sequences previously thought to be noncoding are pervasively translated. To identify protein-coding genes in this noncanonical translatome, we combine an integrative framework for extremely sensitive ribosome profiling analysis, iRibo, with high-powered selection inferences tailored for short sequences. We construct a reference translatome for "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " comprising 5,400 canonical and almost 19,000 noncanonical translated elements.

Our results suggest that most translated elements are not conserved protein-coding genes and contribute to genotype-phenotype relationships through fast-evolving molecular mechanisms."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "S.\u00a0cerevisiae"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " translates over 18,000 unannotated open reading frames"}]}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Only a few translated unannotated sequences are conserved genes"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Almost all unannotated coding sequences are likely evolutionarily short lived"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Evolutionarily transient coding sequences provide fitness benefits"}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Ribosome profiling experiments show widespread translation of unannotated sequences, but it is unknown how many encode biologically significant proteins.
