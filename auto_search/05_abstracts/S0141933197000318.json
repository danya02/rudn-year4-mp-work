Correctness proofs for the proposed broadcasting algorithm are presented and the algorithm is also proven to be livelock-and deadlock-free. The proposed virtual source broadcast (VSB) algorithm can be implemented alone without requiring any virtual channels. However, supporting simultaneous unicast and broadcast messages will require two additional virtual channels per physical link in addition to the virtual channels required for the unicast algorithm. The paper also compares the proposed VSB algorithm with broadcasting techniques that have been proposed by other authors."}]}]}]}]}}
