By classifying the hydrolysate types and coding them into numerical values, two robust mathematical models with five selected attributes from molecular docking were established based on LogitBoost and partial least squares regression with overall accuracy of 83.3% and 100%, respectively. Then, they were adopted for efficient screening the potential mutagenesis library of \u03b2-1,3-xylanases that only product oligosaccharides. The virtually designed AncXyl10 was selected and experimentally verified to produce only \u03b2-1,3-xylobiose (60.38%) and \u03b2-1,3-xylotriose (39.62%), which facilitated the preparation of oligosaccharides with high purity. The underlying mechanism of AncXyl10 may associated with the gap processing and ancestral amino acid substitution in the process of ancestral sequence reconstruction. Since many carbohydrate-active enzymes have highly conserved active sites, the strategy and their biomolecular basis will shield a new light for engineering carbohydrates hydrolase to produce specific oligosaccharides."}]}]}]}]}}
