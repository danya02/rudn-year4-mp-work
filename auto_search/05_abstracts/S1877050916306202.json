As mobile users are extensively growing the requirements for various applications may vary time to time, and it is the need to keep presence information of each mobile user up to date hence the approach for QoS routing may not be proactive. The proposed approach has two phases namely route discovery phase and route maintenance phase. When a source node has to pass data to a destination node with QoS requirements it starts with the route discovery phase. And when the data transfer is been finished and route is found it require to maintain path to destination which is been done by route maintenance phase. This is required by the mobile services and the network such as ad-hoc. This is very much desirable and required in mobile ad hoc networks and hence is done in the route maintenance phase."}]}]}]}}
