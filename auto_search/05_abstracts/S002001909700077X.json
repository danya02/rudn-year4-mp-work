The problem of finding an optimal assignment of wavelengths to requests is of fundamental importance in bandwidth utilization. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem on fixed constant-size topologies. We combine this algorithm with ideas from Raghavan and Upfal (1994) to obtain an optimal assignment of wavelengths on constant degree undirected trees. Mihail, Kaklamanis, and Rao (1995) posed the following open question: what is the complexity of this problem on directed trees? We show that it is NP-complete both on binary and constant depth directed trees."}]}]}]}}
