Detection of aggressive driving, e.g. speeding and driving with smaller safety distance than recommended, is currently in the domain of law enforcement services. We propose a novel approach for aggressive driving detection using received signal strength indicator value measurement in vehicular ad hoc networks. We present an introduction to vehicular social networks, cluster formation and a short description of our method. Proposal is critically discussed in terms of implementation and privacy issues, and is followed by guidelines for future work in that field."}]}]}]}}
