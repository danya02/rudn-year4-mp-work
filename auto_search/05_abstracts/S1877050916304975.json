Nature of channel being broadcast and presence of MAC in AP makes proper infrastructure and sharing among hosts. This makes research paper about MAC case study and research development with proper verification and validation. This enhances in DLL gives wireless data link and sustains its link with corresponding MAC address 100%, which never bottlenecks OSI layer realization. Among the entire required parameters, only selected parametric dependent layered characteristics such as codes for enhancing data rate, selection of different radio in MIMO and channel, modes of WLAN are verified and validated by constructing clouddatabase in the slottime margin of 24"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "hours in real-time scenario.
