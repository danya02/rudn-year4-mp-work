The authors consider the creation of a software model for an imitation system for managing logistics production, taking into account the study of the behaviour line and the class of belonging of the user of the system in relation to the spatial aspect of the configuration of placements. The generalization of the Markov chain in the applied aspect is considered in the article. A new paradigm for organizing the distribution line of goods is formalized through the introduction of software algorithms for the classification and optimization of the trajectory of movement. The results of dynamic simulation of the developed system and optimal ratios for predicting the optimal lighting route with adaptive correlation of the distributed lighting system of the route within the framework of the Mesh network are presented."}]}]}]}}
