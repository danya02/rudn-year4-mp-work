Inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, as one of the most important method to realize wireless power transfer, usually work under weak coupling conditions and obtain high power transmission efficiency through resonance compensation circuits. In the case of reduced power transmission distance, the IPT system will enter an over-coupled state, causing the system output power to change drastically and the system to detune, and frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting will also occur. This paper first theoretically deduces the root cause of the output power variation of several typical topological IPT systems under over-coupled conditions, and then analyzes their frequency bifurcation and frequency splitting characteristics by numerical analysis methods, which can provide a reference for the design of IPT systems. Finally, the theory of this paper is verified by simulation and a 2\u00a0kW test prototype."}]}]}]}}
