They gather traces about the learner (course view, wiki view, quiz attempt, etc.) in event logs. These logs offer the opportunity to provide dashboards and analysis on learners. There are several techniques that analyze event logs for different purposes (adaptation, recommendation, performance detection, etc.). Within this framework, our central focus is upon Educational Process Mining technique which generates process models for improving learning resource recommendation."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spara0076", "view": "all"}, "_": "We set forward an architecture leading to discover process models and recommend to the learner not only learning resource but also process models, each of which is relative to a specific learning resource. These models exert a certain influence on the result of learning resource recommendation. One of the reason that endows our work with an original aspect is that it automatically analyses event logs based on multi-features extracted from the learner\u2019s profiles. However, the state of the art works require a manual analysis step based on learning results uniquely. We evaluated the discovered process models grounded on the event logs of Moodle LMS. These event logs contain 42,438 traces of 100 students who learned a course over one semester. Results corroborate the good performance of our work."}]}]}]}}
