In order to optimize solar energy generation, particular focus must be paid to both application and maintenance. IoT-based solar monitoring system proposals have been made in order to collect and analyze solar data, which will allow for performance prediction and reliable power output. Demand-side energy management's primary objective is to maximize the economical utilization of renewable resources without sacrificing overall energy efficiency. In areas where energy use is strongly reliant on the grid, an intelligent energy management system may effectively regulate energy usage. With cloud computing, the opportunities and problems driven out by growing energy grids may be successfully handled."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "This study examines the role that energy management systems play in both research and practical industrial practises, acknowledging both as stakeholders in this undertaking. The research investigation closely looks at a number of IoT-related topics in relation to solar energy production. In addition to providing guidance for upcoming academics in the field, it also lists possible future uses for IoT, inspiring them to further the field's present understanding and provide new ideas. Providing a thorough analysis of energy management in smart architecture is the purpose."}]}]}]}}
