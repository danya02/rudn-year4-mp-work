Use has been made of Markov model in order to predict the wavelength congestion. A routing algorithm is developed based on the Markov modeling. The results are compared with existing algorithms\u2014ASP, WSP and OTGA. Validation results have shown that the performance of the system is significantly improved in terms of bandwidth blocking ratio, network utilization and fairness."}]}]}]}}
