Thus, minimizing the total energy consumption of such a system is important. We investigate the problem of offline scheduling for streaming applications composed of non-preemptible periodic dependent tasks on homogeneous Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoCs) such that their total energy consumption is minimized under memory constraints. We propose a novel unified approach that integrates task-level software pipelining with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to solve the problem. Our approach is supported by a set of novel techniques, which include constructing an initial schedule based on a list scheduling where the priority of each task is its approximate successor-tree-consistent deadline such that the workload across all the processors is balanced, a retiming heuristic to transform intra-period dependencies into inter-period dependencies for enhancing parallelism, assigning an optimal discrete frequency for each task and each message using a Non-Linear Programming (NLP)-based algorithm and an Integer-Linear Programming (ILP)-based algorithm, and an incremental approach to reduce the memory usage of the retimed schedule in case of memory size violations. Using a set of real and synthetic benchmarks, we have implemented and compared our unified approach with two state-of-the-art approaches, RDAG+GeneS ("}, {"#name": "cross-ref", "$": {"id": "d1e479", "refid": "b36"}, "_": "Wang et al., 2011"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") , and JCCTS ("}, {"#name": "cross-ref", "$": {"id": "d1e484", "refid": "b37"}, "_": "Wang et al., 2013a"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ").
