Many companies implementing Lean Manufacturing start with a series of 5S events to remove the workplace and improve workflows between processes. Predominantly used in the manufacturing sector, they can now be found deployed in diverse industries such as banking, mining, construction and many other industries. The S pillars are available in order to improve because waste must be made visible. When it is visible, we must learn to see. Part of a Lean Manufacturing organization is to expose waste and then to systematically attack it. 5S is used to manage the work area more effectively and should not be confused with other programs such as TPM (total productive maintenance) that are more machine and equipment focused, even though the concepts are similar."}]}]}]}}
