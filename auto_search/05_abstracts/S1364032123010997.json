According to research, among lighting systems, public lighting systems (PLSs) have significant potential for such energy projects. It can be realized through smart dimming, installing light-emitting diode (LED) luminaries, using renewable energy, etc. Accordingly, this work reviews the E-saving, E-efficiency, and E-cost reduction schemes for real-world PLSs by giving related techno-economic formulation. In this regard, smart control/dimming approaches via combined Internet of Things and wireless technologies, installing LED luminaires, optimal layout design, reactive power compensation, etc., are discussed by reporting the saving potentials, the payback period of the investment, and carbon reduction effects. Moreover, the use of renewable energy (including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, pump-"}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "as"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-turbine systems, biomass plants, etc.) integrated with batteries to power PLSs is discussed by giving the E-cost reduction potential. Moreover, the pros/cons of previous works, the key findings of this review work, and recommendations for future works are outlined. This work shows future research directions, identifies high-potential energy projects for energy planners, and outlines the importance of renewable energy in making PLSs more environmentally friendly. Moreover, the role of energy policymakers\u2019 financial support in expediting the widespread enforcement of energy projects is outlined by studying the payback period of projects, which is about 5\u20137 years (on average 5.8 years, 6.9 years, 4.9 years, and 5.6 years for E-saving, E-efficiency, combined E-saving/E-efficiency, and E-cost reduction schemes, respectively)."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "alttext0010"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S1364032123010997/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id13"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "In-depth literature review of energy policies in real-world public lighting systems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Current and critical solutions for energy saving and efficiency."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The role of renewable/battery systems in powering public lighting."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "The importance of LED lighting and smart control in reducing carbon emissions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "Pros and cons of the previous works, and key findings of the study."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
