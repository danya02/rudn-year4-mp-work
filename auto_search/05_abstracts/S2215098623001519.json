The proposed compact-sized CSRR structure exhibits notable characteristics such as high absorption coefficients and polarization-insensitive behaviours across a wide range of angles. The results demonstrate a notably high absorption efficiency of 97%, 99%, and 98% at 3.7275\u00a0GHz, 4.7075\u00a0GHz, and 5.9325\u00a0GHz. A 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 array is designed and verified by experimental results. The proposed design exhibits superior performance compared to previously published designs, which suffer from significant limitations such as a large metamaterial structure, reduced absorption frequency bands, and a lower fraction of absorption bands. The proposed design exhibits potential for utilization in developing wireless sensor network applications that require compact and highly efficient harvesting systems."}]}]}]}]}}
