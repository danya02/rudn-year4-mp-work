The modeling framework suggests a maximum daily mean contribution of the stubble-burning fires to the air pollution in Delhi in the months of October\u2013November 2021 to be around 30\u201335%. We find that the contribution from stubble burning activities to the air quality in Delhi is maximum (minimum) during the turbulent hours of late morning to afternoon (calmer hours of evening to early morning). The quantification of this contribution is critical from the crop-residue and air-quality management perspective for policymakers in the source and the receptors regions, respectively."}]}]}]}]}}
