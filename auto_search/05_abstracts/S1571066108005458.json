In particular, we look at cross-lingual information retrieval, multimedia information retrieval and semantic-based information retrieval. Cross-lingual information retrieval deals with asking questions in one language and retrieving documents in one or more different languages. With an increasingly globalized economy, the ability to find information in other languages is becoming a necessity. Multimedia information retrieval deals with finding media other than text, i.e. music and pictures. With the explosion of digital media that is available on the Internet and present on users' computers techniques for quickly and accurately finding desired media is important. Semantic based information retrieval goes beyond classical information retrieval and uses semantic information to understand the documents and queries in order to aid retrieval. Semantic based information retrieval goes beyond standard surface information by using the concepts represented in documents and queries to improve retrieval performance."}]}]}]}}
