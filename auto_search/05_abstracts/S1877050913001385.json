Mining online opinion is a form of sentiment analysis that is treated as a difficult text classification task. In this paper, we explore the role of text pre-processing in sentiment analysis, and report on experimental results that demonstrate that with appropriate feature selection and representation, sentiment analysis accuracies using support vector machines (SVM) in this area may be significantly improved. The level of accuracy achieved is shown to be comparable to the ones achieved in topic categorisation although sentiment analysis is considered to be a much harder problem in the literature."}]}]}]}}
