During an earthquake, furniture and mobile equipment can either become obstacles or act as passive life safety systems by providing safe shelter for people involved in the event. The combination of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and anti-seismic furniture could serve as a means to transform them into intelligent protection systems to protect people in case of an earthquake, facilitating their detection and localization during the rescue operations through the integration of a supportive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. In this article, we report about the design and development of the SAFE ICT Platform which comprises wireless IoT devices integrated into anti-seismic furniture that activate in response to earthquakes to signal the presence of individuals needing rescue. The SAFE ICT Platform also includes local and cloud computing systems for device management and monitoring, alongside a localization and support system to assist rescuers in pinpointing and aiding individuals. A comprehensive evaluation scenario of the proposed solution is also discussed."}]}]}]}}
