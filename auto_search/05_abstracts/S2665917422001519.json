Quality of Services in Healthcare Systems may be characterised broadly through parameters such as accuracy of data, speed of decision-making, timely treatment, security of data, real-time monitoring and controlling of the health systems, failure handling and quality of life. In this research work, an attempt is made to achieve the Quality of Services in Healthcare through IoT and Fog Computing, considering optimization of one or more of these parameters. An integrated hardware system with software programs is developed for EHS safety using microcontroller. The Processing Packages are designed to communicate through the Internet of Things (IoT) based on the Accident Reduction Model (ARM) and Augmented Data Recognition (ADR) system.When ECG signals are sensed through IoT and sent to the cloud for the analysis purpose, delays are caused by the time results reach the medical staff. This delay in decision making is due to the transmission delay and processing delays. To overcome these issues, Fog Computing can be used."}]}]}]}}
