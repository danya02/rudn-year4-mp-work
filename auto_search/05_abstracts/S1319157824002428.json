NCCE involves longer span detection and more complicated rules for relation decisions, making it more difficult than previous chain extraction tasks, such as coreference resolution. Current methods achieve certain progress on the NCCE task, but they suffer from insufficient syntax information utilization and incomplete mention relation mining, which are helpful for NCCE. To fill these gaps, we propose a syntax-guided model using a triaffine interaction to improve the performance of the NCCE task. Instead of solely relying on the text information to detect compound mentions, we also utilize the noun-phrase (NP) boundary information in constituency trees to incorporate prior boundary knowledge. In addition, we use biaffine and triaffine operations to mine the mention interactions in the local and global context of a document. To show the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct a series of experiments on a human-annotated NCCE dataset. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline systems. Moreover, in-depth analyses reveal the effect of utilizing syntactic information and mention interactions in the local and global contexts."}]}]}]}}
