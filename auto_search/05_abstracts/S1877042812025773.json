A total of 237 Secondary Four biology students with three different trait anxiety levels were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions: (a) text with static graphics (TSG), (b) text with animated graphics (TAG) and (c) text with segmented animation (TSG). Analysis of t-tests and ANCOVA were conducted by using intelligent quotients as a covariate. The results showed that segmented animation is more effective than continuous animation and static graphics for improving learning across all levels of anxiety. Seemingly, a continuous animation does not provide sufficient time for optimal cognitive processing of information, thus inhibiting effective learning. Segmented animation helps high anxiety students overcome the threat of extraneous cognitive load thus optimizing their information-processing abilities."}]}]}]}}
