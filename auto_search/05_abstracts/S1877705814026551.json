The developed network consists of a localization device which the person is wearing (BodyGuard-System), a mobile relay station in the air, and a base station. All three parts communicate with the same radio chip. The BodyGuard-System is an inertial navigation system which was developed for localization in difficult environments with high accuracy and low measurement uncertainty. To increase the range of the system, a multi-hop network was built up. The measured data of the BodyGuard-System and the mobile relay station is visualized on a PC in the base station. This multi-hop network is necessary for example for fire department missions."}]}]}]}}
