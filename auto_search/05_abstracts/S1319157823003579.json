To address this issue, a new multi-objective clustering approach is introduced in this work for grouping the sensor nodes of WSNs. Moreover, a multi-objective hybrid optimisation technique called Election based Aquila Optimizer (EAO) which is the combination of Aquila Optimizer (AO) and the Election-Based Optimisation Algorithm (EBOA) is proposed in this work to make sure that the Cluster Head (CH) selection process in WSNs to identify the best CH. In addition, the proposed method incorporates the newly developed optimization technique with convolutional neural network (CNN) as an Optimized CNN (O-CNN) to improve the clustering algorithm's precision and also enhance the training accuracy and testing accuracy. The proposed approach is evaluated through experiments and proved as better than other approaches by obtaining 99.23% as classification accuracy, 76.92% as throughput, 99% as packet delivery ratio, 98.24% as network lifetime and 50% as maximum energy consumption and it resolves a significant difficulty in precision agriculture."}]}]}]}}
