Competition is no longer conceived as it was in traditional markets. In this global market, knowledge is considered an asset that has an economic value for an organization and a strategic resource used to increase productivity and offer stability in dynamic competitive environments. Such significance of knowledge implies the need for protecting this vital resource by safeguarding the right access, its persistence over time, and its adequate retrieval. In this work, we propose an organizational memory architecture, and annotation and retrieval information strategies based on domain ontologies that take in account complex words to retrieve information through natural language queries. To test these strategies, we implemented a flexible framework to experiment with knowledge retrieval approaches. Finally, experimental results are evaluated and analyzed through standard measures."}]}]}]}}
