Since not all sites have production, it is essential to transport products between sites. The order of pumping operations is determined by the scheduling plan. The scheduling plan includes the type and quantity of products to be delivered, the start of deliveries, and routes. The type and quantity of products to be delivered, the start of deliveries and routes are included in the scheduling plan. A scheduling plan is feasible if it does not contain inconsistencies. Checking a one-month schedule is a complex task in real multi-source mesh-like pipeline networks, thus it is advisable to use a discrete event simulation system. This work presents improvements on our previous simulation model. In the improved simulation model, it is possible to reroute, split, and reverse the flow direction of the products in the pipe, amongst other things."}]}]}]}}
