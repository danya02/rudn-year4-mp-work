First, we provide a comparison of existing scheduling algorithms and classify them based on the degree of fairness, the scheduling techniques and their implementation frameworks. Then we propose a fair scheduling approach using multiple gateways. The proposed scheduling approach consists of four important steps, namely, requirement tables, requirement propagation, clique generation and schedule generation. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of fair scheduling with the method that does not use fair scheduling. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheduling has better performance with respect to the metrics used for performance evaluation."}]}]}]}}
