It is very energy efficient, can transmit wireless data over long distances, and supports mesh networking. In the process of distributed energy harvesting, the wireless sensor network composed of LoRa can effectively monitor the environmental information and wireless energy harvesting system, and the battery requirement is very low, and the data can be distributed with very little power consumption, which can be used in harsh environment and remote mountainous areas. In this paper, the composition of the distributed energy harvesting system is discussed first, then the energy situation of LoRa in low-power wireless energy transmission is analyzed, and finally the wireless low-power sensor network is tested."}]}]}]}}
