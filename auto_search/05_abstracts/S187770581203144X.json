Under the metal mining environment, use the sensing technology of wireless sensor networks and Radio Frequency IDentification(RFID) technology, to collect relevant information in real time in the mine production process and reach the intelligent perception of the environment, personnel and equipment safety. Build a cloud platform to carry out cloud services, improve the utilization of information resources and construct the integrated management and control of the metal mines Internet of Things(IOT) platform to realize the real-time information and integrated information intelligent collaboration, intelligent decision-making, management and control integration. This system has been applied in Nanjing Meishan Mining Company."}]}]}]}}
