We combine the logical reflection of Maude language and the hierarchical structure of the Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS) to provide an executable formal model for WMN. This model, called Bis-WMN specifies both the WMN topology and any behavior which may be observed during its routing process. Some inherent properties have been then checked with the LTL model checker of Maude."}]}]}]}}
