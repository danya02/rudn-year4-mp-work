AGORA has been developed in partnership with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes and validated in the police and medical domains. This tool allows to export both anonymized texts and identified entities to structured files, thus, simplifying its exploitation for analysis purposes. Also, AGORA is capable of plotting the location entities identified in the documents, as well as obtaining and displaying relevant information from their geographical surroundings. Thus, it simplifies the task of generating comprehensive datasets for subsequent data analysis or predictive tasks. Its main goal is to foster cooperation between public institutions and research centers by easing document sharing as well as serving as a foundation for addressing succeeding phases in data science."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e2030"}, "_": "The paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of the literature on Named Entity Recognition methodologies and technologies.
