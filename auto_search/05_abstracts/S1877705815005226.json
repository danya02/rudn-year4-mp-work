Lower cost services, as well as increased link capacity will justify introduction of new technologies onboard ships. Implementation of new technologies is important, but also the appropriate implementation of processes and the awareness and motivation of the people on board that ensures the value of such a service. In order to realize more convenient link, the development of a mathematical model is proposed as basis for decision making optimization of data traffic route in communication of maritime vessels. In addition to the presentation of previous research, the paper also shows the optimization of data traffic route by the example of authentic maritime communications within the organizational environment."}]}]}]}}
