In computer vision, this image segmentation is one of the vital works and it is relatively complicated than other vision undertakings as it needs low-level spatial data. Especially, Deep Learning has impacted the field of segmentation incredibly and gave us today different successful models. The deep learning associated Generated Adversarial Networks (GAN) has presenting remarkable outcomes on image segmentation. In this study, the authors have presented a systematic review analysis on recent publications of GAN models and their applications. Three libraries such as Embase (Scopus), WoS, and PubMed have been considered for searching the relevant papers available in this area. Search outcomes have identified 2084 documents, after two-phase screening 52 potential records are included for final review. The following applications of GAN have been emerged: 3D object generation, medicine, pandemics, image processing, face detection, texture transfer, and traffic controlling. Before 2016, research in this field was limited and thereafter its practical usage came into existence worldwide. The present study also envisions the challenges associated with GAN and paves the path for future research in this realm."}]}]}]}}
