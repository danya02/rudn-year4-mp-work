These functions are often disturbed by anthropogenic influences, such as urbanization and habitat fragmentation, yet the effects of long-term exposures to environmental contaminants on movement have yet to be examined. The long lifespans and broad diets of crocodilians often lead to bioaccumulation of persistent contaminants and confer a marked vulnerability to consequent physiological effects. In this study, we investigate the relationships between blood concentrations of mercury (Hg), a widespread contaminant with well characterized neurotoxicity, and movement patterns in free living, naturally exposed American alligators ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Alligator mississippiensis"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "). We sampled adult male alligators from two former nuclear cooling reservoirs with different Hg contamination histories and placed GPS transmitters on a subset of individuals from each reservoir (13 total). Data collected over the ensuing two years were analyzed using a linear mixed effects framework combined with AICc model selection to resolve the relationships linking seasonal alligator movement (daily activity (s) and daily distance (m)) and home range to climate conditions, individual traits, and blood Hg concentrations (mg/kg; wet weight). We found that climate conditions, alligator size (snout-vent-length), and blood Hg concentrations all influence alligator daily activity but do not contribute to alligator daily movement (distance). Furthermore, we found that blood Hg concentrations were strongly correlated with seasonal home range size where individuals with elevated Hg had larger home ranges in spring, fall, and winter. These findings provide insight into how climate, anthropogenic contaminants, and individual traits relate to alligator movement patterns across seasons."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0070", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0050"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0030", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S0048969724009987/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0075", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Mercury can have negative effects on movement behavior but is understudied in long-lived top predators."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Mercury blood concentrations, alligator size, and climate collectively shape alligator daily activity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Alligators with elevated mercury levels exhibited reduced activity, potentially indicating negative consequences."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Blood mercury concentrations were strongly correlated with seasonal home range size of adult male alligators."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
