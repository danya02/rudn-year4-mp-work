The results also show that at a longer delay, medical students and physicians are more inclined to infer unstated, but script-typical information. With regard to the RTs, the interaction between typicality and textual presence on RTs could be replicated: RTs for prototypical unstated items were longer than for any of the other types of information. Apart from this, RTs for different statements did not show a consistent pattern."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0025", "role": "discussion", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0025"}, "_": "Discussion"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0070", "view": "all"}, "_": "The superior memory discrimination for script atypical, compared with script prototypical, information, and at immediate retention, compared to delayed retention supports theoretical notions as well as previous research on illness scripts as general event representations with actual case information \u201ctagged\u201d to these stored representations.
