The purpose of this design is to avoid the isolated information island in an industrial system, and allow devices with different types of communication protocol to form one industrial network. It has realized by hardware and software. On the hardware side, the device is composed of MCU, power supply module, two rs232 communication modules, one rs485 communication module, two ethernet communication modules and the watchdog. On the software side, the adapter integrates the protocols of Modbus TCP, Modbus RTU, rs232 transparent transmission, rs485 transparent transmission, TCP server transparent transmission, TCP client transparent transmission and UDP transparent transmission. Because the device has realized the calibration algorithm, it can control rs232-HART protocol converter to achieve interconnection of the HART equipment. One of the rs232 port is used to interconnection of a wireless communication module. The wireless communication module is designed by ourselves, the wireless modules can automatically form a network of each other and communication with the host. Now the multifunctional industrial wireless network adapter has been tested and verified that it can make multiple equipments with different communication protocols form one network and works steadily."}]}]}]}}
