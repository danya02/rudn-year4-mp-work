The proposed framework uses ontology structure for automatic image annotation. It supports semantic retrieval by combining ontological concepts, visual and textual features automatically extracted from images and their textual descriptions. The Ontology-driven analysis module automatically generates annotation for domain objects. This paper also reports a new dataset designed for its evaluation. The dataset consists of images displayed in various galleries of Allahabad museum along with their textual description. We have collected 1200 images and extracted their visual and textual features for the purpose of retrieval."}]}]}]}}
