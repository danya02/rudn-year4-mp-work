Thus, accurate and fast fault prediction and location in distribution networks are essential for increasing reliability, fast restoration, optimal electrical energy consumption, and customer satisfaction. This study reviews and investigates fault prediction and fault location topics. To this end, the existing methods and views in the context of fault prediction are reviewed first; then, fault location is investigated. This paper investigates various methods, their advantages, disadvantages, technical reports, and patents in conventional distribution networks, smart-grids, and micro-grids. Comparison of this study with other surveys indicates that it is more comprehensive and despite others covers fault prediction. In addition, it includes an up to date review of the methods for distance measurement and fault location considering different network types (AC/DC), presence of DG, communication and automation standards, synchronous and unsynchronous measurement, magnetic measurement, and state estimation-based fault location methods."}]}]}]}}
