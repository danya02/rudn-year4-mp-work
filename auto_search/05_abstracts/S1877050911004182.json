With the availability of WiMAX, a large number of these peers will be ubiquitous and located on WiMAX based mobile nodes across the Internet. This chapter proposed a framework for providing quality of service (QoS) to the overlay P2P network over a WiMAX infrastructure. The work integrates traffic engineering and analytical based approach and has been validated with results from experiments."}]}]}]}}
