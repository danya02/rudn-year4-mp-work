In this paper, a new QoS-aware routing protocol based on AODV named QAODV (QoS- AODV) is proposed. Under the premise of the delay and available bandwidth meeting the QoS demands, the protocol defines a new route metric with the hop count and load rate so as to select the best route according to it. Simulation results show that, compared with AODV, the performance of QAODV is better on both network throughput and end-to-end delay with small increase of control overhead. As a whole, the protocol improves the QoS guarantee capability in the WMN."}]}]}]}}
