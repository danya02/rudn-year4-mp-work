Presently, the extent of the involvement of these plentiful sEVs in the onset and progression of ischemic stroke remains an unresolved question. Our study systematically identified the characteristics of sEVs derived from neurons under hypoxic conditions (HypEVs) by physical characterization, sEV absorption, proteomics and transcriptomics analysis.

Knockdown of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to validate FUS-mediated HypEV neuroprotection and mitochondrial mRNA release. Hypoxia promoted the secretion of sEVs, and HypEVs were more easily taken up and utilized by recipient cells. The MRI results illustrated that the cerebral infarction volume was reduced by 45% with the application of HypEVs, in comparison to the non- HypEV treatment group. Mechanistically, the FUS protein is necessary for the uptake and neuroprotection of HypEVs against ischemic stroke as well as carrying a large amount of mitochondrial mRNA in HypEVs. However, FUS knockdown attenuated the neuroprotective rescue capabilities of HypEVs. Our comprehensive dataset clearly illustrates that FUS-mediated HypEVs deliver exceptional neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke, primarily through the maintenance of neurite integrity and the reduction of mitochondria-associated apoptosis."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "Neurons release more sEVs after being stimulated by hypoxia and promote the entry of FUS into sEVs.
