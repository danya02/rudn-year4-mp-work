A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes\u2019 preferred parents. We evaluate the FRR mechanism by simulations and experiments. The results indicate that FRR can reduce the network formation time by up to 50% in certain network scenarios."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1447", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1448"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1450", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1451", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1453"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1454"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1457", "view": "all"}, "_": "Explores the high formation time issue of last-mile wireless networks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1459"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1462", "view": "all"}, "_": "Proposing a novel mechanism to reduce the recovery time in Smart Grid networks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1464"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1467", "view": "all"}, "_": "Investigates the influence of various configuration parameters of the RPL protocol."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
