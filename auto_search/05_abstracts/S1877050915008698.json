In this paper, we present a novel encoding scheme at data link layer with the characteristic of cut-through switch. By using the proposed technique, we can increase throughput by reducing re-transmissions in the network. We have verified our proposed method by simulation in NS3. The simulation results indicate that in-spite of high interference, we can achieve improved throughput and less delay with proposed model."}]}]}]}}
