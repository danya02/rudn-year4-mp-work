The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model such that a joint scheduling and routing is developed to maximize network lifetime. An ILP model for Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol is proposed. The main objective of the ILP model is to build an energy efficient joint routing tree and TDMA scheduling framework considering the EEDS assumptions. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations. The results obtained by the ILP model are compared with the EEDS protocol simulation results."}]}]}]}}
