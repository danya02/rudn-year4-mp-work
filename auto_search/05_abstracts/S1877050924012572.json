Collecting data from various nodes, extracting the necessary fields, correlating the data according to system needs, storing the data and reporting the required information are the main functions of such Analytics Platforms in Telecommunication Systems. Emergency calls are mostly made from cell phones and location information can be sent along with them. With Big Data Analytics, it is possible to use the emergency call systems more effectively and make improvements to save lives. In this study, as an industry experience, the structure and working principles of an Analytics Platform which is used to measure and report the location information accuracy of Emergency 911 (E911) calls are going to be provided."}]}]}]}}
