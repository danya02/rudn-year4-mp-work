ELVs are valuable resources in urban mining, and a 95% ELV recovery rate will be required by law. In this research, a smart dismantling monitoring system and smart trolley system have been developed for an ELV recycling center. The smart trolley handles each ELV and is equipped with a weighing load cell, RFID tag for ELV identification, and Zigbee wireless communication device. When a trolley is loaded with a target ELV to be dismantled, the trolley is registered with the ELV. When arriving at a workstation, the trolley is identified by the station's RFID reader and delivers the current ELV weight via the Zigbee device. The required dismantling instructions are displayed on the station's PC monitor based on the corresponding vehicle part database. The developed system was implemented at a recycling center in central Korea. It facilitates remote real-time monitoring via Internet of each workstation's dismantling status and of vehicles currently being processed. The part dismantling results are stored in a computer server for future verification."}]}]}]}}
