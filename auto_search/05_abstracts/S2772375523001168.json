Through soil survey, we confirmed the existence of a large channel beneath one of the liquefaction plots, suggesting considerably high spatial heterogeneity of soil salinity across the greenhouse. Secondly, the high salinity level could not be controlled by drip irrigation at all. Finally, 1-week flooded leaching treatments were carried out; the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey indicated that the salinity level decreased significantly except around the channel plot. The combination of the flooded leaching and natural rainfall was more effective for salt leaching in macropores and channels. Our analysis using the WSNS highlighted three management strategies that may help reduce a polder's salinity level."}]}]}]}]}}
