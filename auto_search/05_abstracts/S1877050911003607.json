The DREAMS architecture simplifies WSN software development for applications with strict requirements for energy harvesting as an alternative power source to conventional batteries. Each software module has a set of features including an energy stamp (ES) and associated priority level (PL) required for the module execution management unit (MEMU) to carry forward a dynamic execution model in compliance with the current harvested energy level. In order to accommodate various design requirements addressing inherent difficulties in industrial equipment monitoring applications, software modules can be selected and configured at compile-time or remotely upgraded at run-time based on the low energy stamps or stringent application requirements. Loosely coupled software modules add increasing level of software architecture flexibility and dynamic configurability while allowing for optional optimizations for specific aspects such as reliability, security, power savings, or time critical event reporting. DREAMS architecture was successfully prototyped to monitor real-time eminent faults present in the ligaments of large vibration screens used in the filtration process of the Oil Sands located in North Alberta, Canada."}]}]}]}}
