To improve the Intelligent Transportation System, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks are the most prominent area that improve the services of ITS. Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks apply multiple channel medium access control scheme according to the IEEE 1609.4 standard draft. According to the standard draft multiple channel medium access control scheme, channels are split into service channels (SCHs) and control channel (CCHs). This work proposes a dynamic control channel interval (DCI) MAC scheme that can variably fix the time interval between SCHs and CCH efficiently. This work divides the SCHs interval time into small interval time slots according to the current network traffic load."}]}]}]}}
