One of the most critical fields of WSN is how effective is the data collection model in such a network. The goal is to ensure data collection consistency and reliability while attempting to conserve the power consumption within the network. We are proposing a balanced data collection model that can be setup on random or controlled WSN deployment that can meet different levels of reliability requirements while balancing power consumption across the network. The proposed model utilizes an optimization heuristic to achieve a set of system-defined goals."}]}]}]}}
