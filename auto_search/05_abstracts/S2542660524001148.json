This paper presents the development of a platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring urban gardens as a strategy to mitigate hunger, promote food sovereignty and circular economy in areas of food shortage. To this end, an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture is proposed and implemented that involves a social design layer that allows an effective transfer of knowledge to communities and a recommendation system based on evolutionary computation to optimize and maximize the productivity of urban orchards, and thus contribute to the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Finally, three experiments in urban gardens are shown to validate evolutionary computation and artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression, genetic algorithms, ant colony algorithms and spatial estimation and inference algorithms such as the Kriging algorithm. The productivity of urban lettuce orchards is increased between 25 and 45%."}]}]}]}}
