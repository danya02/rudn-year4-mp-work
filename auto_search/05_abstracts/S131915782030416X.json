Our whole world is enveloped by a blanket of innumerable smart devices equipped with the sensors and actuators. Extensive research on the Internet of things (IoT) with cloud technologies, make it possible to accumulate tremendous data created from this heterogeneous environment and transform it into precious knowledge by utilizing data mining technologies. Furthermore, this generated knowledge will play a key role in intelligent decision making, system performance boosting, and optimum management of resources and services. With this background, this paper presents a systematic and detailed review of various data mining techniques employed in the large and small scale IoT applications to formulate an intelligent environment. It also presents an overview of cloud-assisted IoT Big data mining system to better understand the importance of data mining for an IoT environment."}]}]}]}}
