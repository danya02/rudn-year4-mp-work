The purpose of this meeting was to bring together an international group of scientists, physicians, patient advocacy groups, and individuals with aniridia to discuss recent advances in knowledge about aniridia and other congenital eye diseases and the development of potential treatments for congenital eye disorders using personalized medicine. Leaders in several areas of eye research and clinical treatment provided a broad perspective on new research advances that impact an understanding of the causes of the damage to the eye associated with aniridia and the development of novel treatments for this and related disorders. Here we summarize the research discussed at the symposium."}]}]}]}}
