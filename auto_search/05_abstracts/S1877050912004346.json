Most of the content in LBS has to be created from scratch and needs to be explicitly location-tagged, which makes existing web content not directly usable for LBS. In this paper we aim at making websites location-aware and feed this information to LBS. For this purpose we \ufb01rst present SALT, an engine that receives websites as input and equips them with location-tags. Compared to other approaches, SALT is capable of extracting locations with a precision up to the street level. While the engine basically works unsupervised, it is also capable to handle user-feedback to improve the results. Second, we present Webnear.me as a use case of SALT. Webnear.me offers location-aware web sur\ufb01ng through a mobile website. It displays nearby websites depending on: 1) the user's current location and 2) the currently visited website. Finally we show that our application has a high acceptance from users through a formative user study."}]}]}]}}
