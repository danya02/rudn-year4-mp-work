As skill requirements evolve, identifying essential competencies becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces a novel ensemble model that combines traditional and transformer-based neural networks to extract both technical and non-technical skills from job descriptions. A substantial dataset of job descriptions from reputable platforms was meticulously annotated for 22 IT roles. The model demonstrated superior performance in extracting both non-technical (67% F-score) and technical skills (72% F-score) compared to conventional CRF and hybrid deep learning models. Specifically, the proposed model outperformed these baselines by an average margin of 10% and 6%, respectively, for non-technical skills, and 29% and 6.8% for technical skills. A 5 \u00d7 2cv paired t-test confirmed the statistical significance of these improvements. In addition, to enhance model interpretability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were employed in the experiments."}]}]}]}}
