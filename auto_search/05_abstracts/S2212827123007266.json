The main objective is to find issues that still need research on heterogeneous communication, especially 5G cellular and localization networks for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the context of Industry 4.0. The research query is formulated based on the research questions and implemented in three selected databases. Then, the query results are categorized into six sections. Consequently, open issues addressed by the assessed papers in five general categories are analyzed and discussed."}]}]}]}}
