It outlines alternative futures (i.e. scenarios) and identifies the role of mobile communications networks in these scenarios. The paper uses an established scenario planning process and a group of experts to determine three scenarios for the evolution of services offered to customers in a future electricity system and four scenarios describing the evolution of grid management. Finally, the role of mobile communications (cellular networks) is analyzed in each of the scenarios. Results show that mobile networks can serve as a key enabler in those scenarios where smart grid evolution would be the most transformative."}]}]}]}}
