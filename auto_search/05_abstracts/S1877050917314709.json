This task identifies customers opinions regarding product features. We develop a system for retrieving tweets about a product from Twitter and detect product features opinions and their polarity. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we used a dataset published by Bing Lius group in our approach experimentation. This dataset contains many notated customer reviews of five products such as Canon G3 and Nokia 6610. Next, we test this method with tweets retrieved from Twitter about Nokia, Samsung and Iphone features products."}]}]}]}}
