In some cases the information relevant to the user request may not exist in the user's native language. Situations may also arise where the user is able to read documents in languages different from the native one, but might have difficulty in formulating queries in them. The main intention behind Multilingual Information Retrieval is to find the relevant information available irrespective of the language used in the query."}]}]}]}}
