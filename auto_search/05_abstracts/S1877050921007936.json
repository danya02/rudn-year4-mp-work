The available qualitative requirements with dynamic nodes, static stations and routers need to be validated without collisions. This can reach to back-haul network with reachability of specific nodes and routers in Wireless Sensor Network. One method of solving the issue is to use local automate based environment for dynamic nodes. Advanced with static environment configuring address agnostic feature could bridge the gap between static and dynamic environments. The multicast probabilistic model using LA-ANA is proposed with quantified metrics in MAC layer to avoid congestion and dark spots in Wireless Sensor Networks. Thus, increasing throughput and fault tolerance levels with 10-15% supporting unicast and multicast delivery."}]}]}]}}
