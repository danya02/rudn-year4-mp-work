Despite the increase in NLP applications, the Uzbek language is still underrepresented, which underscores the importance of our work. Our dataset includes 1,160 sentences with nearly 19,000 word forms annotated for parts of speech and named entities, making it a valuable resource for linguistic research and machine learning applications in Uzbek. In addition, for practical application and experiments, the authors have developed two algorithms that, using this dictionary, identifies named entities in Uzbek language texts. In addition, the authors described the methodology for creating the dataset, the design of the algorithms, and their application to the Uzbek language. This study not only provides an important dataset for future named entity recognition(NER) tasks in the Uzbek language, but also offers a methodological basis for the use of vocabulary-based NER or Machine learning NER in other low-resource languages (e.g. Karakalpak). The dataset (and algorithms) we have developed can be used to create applications such as improved chatbot systems, text mining applications and other analytical tools for the Uzbek language, contributing to the development of those areas in the region for which these solutions will be developed."}]}]}]}}
