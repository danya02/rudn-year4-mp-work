The overall success rate in group A regarding SLN retrieval was 97.7%, whereas most tumours were located in the upper outer (47.7%) and upper inner quadrant (27.9%). Although the technique was equally successful in the other quadrants, the share of tumours in the lower outer, and the lower inner quadrant, and the retroareolar region was smaller, representing 17.4%, 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was two, with a positivity rate of 24.4%. The occurrence of axillary neuralgia and axillary skin retraction was significantly higher in group B along with tendentially more axillary seroma formation.
