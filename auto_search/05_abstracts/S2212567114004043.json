Besides the techno-centric Quality of Service (QoS) metrics a research area called Quality of Experience (QoE) provides metrics and methods for quality evaluation from the end-user's perspective. This contribution focuses on a QoE estimation of Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. Existing methods of voice quality estimation are compared on different voice codecs tested on a network topology suffering from distortions of real network. Finally, a regression analysis is employed to provide better understanding of impact of network conditions (delay, jitter, packet loss) on the VoIP service quality. The results can improve the voice quality monitoring systems in corporate networks."}]}]}]}}
