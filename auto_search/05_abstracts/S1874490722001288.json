However, there is much room for improvement in localization and tracking accuracy. In this paper, by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements we propose an enhanced geometric filter which consists of a series of weights corresponding to RSS, distance, and angle, respectively. Specifically, RSS-based weights are dependent on the change in RSS of communication links to remove improbable target locations. To ensure robust tracking performance, distance-based weights are assigned to probable target locations. Angle-based weights are used to ensure the correct direction of motion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed geometric filter could improve the accuracy of positioning by up to 50.8% for non-straight path and 48.3% for straight path over some state-of-the-art methods."}]}]}]}}
