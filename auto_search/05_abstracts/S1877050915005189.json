SMMN has multiple basic modules of 2D-mesh networks that are recursively interconnected by Midimew network to create higher-level networks. In this paper, we explain the architectural details of SMMN,we also present the a deadlock-free routing algorithm for SMMN using four virtual channels and evaluate the performance of dynamic communication of SMMN network using proposed routing algorithm under uniform traffic pattern .We also evaluate the performance of dynamic communication of TESH network using topaz simulator. It is shown that the SMMN network has high throughput and low latency, which yield higher performance of dynamic communication compare to other Hierarchical networks."}]}]}]}}
