The focus then shifts to the critical processes of data management, including collection, refinement, and feature engineering, alongside strategies for efficient data mining from targeted databases and literatures. Subsequently, we present a concise overview of the diverse applications of these algorithms, emphasizing their transformative impact in both fields. Finally, this review explores the future prospects and challenges of these emerging algorithms."}]}]}]}}
