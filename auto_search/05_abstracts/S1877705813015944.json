But the need for sustaining real time applications for users of MANET has become very important. This paper makes primary contribution on scheduling algorithms that categorizes and prioritizes the real-time traffic with the intention of improving the performance of the real-time applications. Five types of scheduling algorithms have been analyzed using OPNET simulator. Simulation results shows that Low Latency queuing algorithm improves the overall performance of the real time applications than all other algorithms."}]}]}]}}
