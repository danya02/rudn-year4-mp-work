One of the important and vital roles is played by the army soldiers. There are many concerns regarding the safety of soldiers. So for their security purpose, many instruments are mounted on them to view their health status as well as their real time location. Bio-sensor systems comprise various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable unobtrusive solutions for health monitoring. This paper gives an ability to track the location and monitor health of the soldiers in real time who become lost and get injured in the battlefield. It helps to minimize the time, search and rescue operation efforts of army control unit. This system enables to army control unit to track the location and monitor health of soldiers using GPS module and wireless body area sensor networks (WBASNs), such as temperature sensor, heart beat sensor, etc. The data coming from sensors and GPS receiver will be transmitted wirelessly using ZigBee module among the fellow soldiers. Furthermore, LoRaWAN network infrastructure has been proposed to be used between the squadron leader and the control unit in high altitude warzones where cellular network coverage is either absent or does not allow data transmission. The collected data will be uploaded on the cloud for further data analysis and predictions using K-Means Clustering algorithm."}]}]}]}}
