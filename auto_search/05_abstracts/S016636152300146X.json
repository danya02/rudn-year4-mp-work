The current limitations in tymely defining and updating engineers' archetypes are attributed to the absence of a structured and automated approach for processing educational and occupational data sources that evolve over time. This study aims to enhance the definition of professional figures in engineering by automating archetype definitions through text mining and adopting a more objective and structured methodology based on topic modeling. This will expand the use of archetypes as a common language, bridging the gap between educational and occupational frameworks by providing a unified and up-to-date engineering professional figure tailored to a specific period, specialization type, and level. We validate the automatically defined industrial engineer archetype against our previously manually defined profile."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0070", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Engineers' archetypes definition by unifying educational and occupational frameworks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Natural language processing for automatic engineers\u2019 archetypes definition."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Archetypes as a common language to tailor professional figures to specific periods, sectors, and levels."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Validation of the prototype software for automatic archetype generation via the industrial engineer case study."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Free online access to the prototype software for archetype generation developed in Python."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
