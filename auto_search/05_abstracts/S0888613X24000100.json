FCA indeed classifies a set of objects described by Boolean attributes in a concept lattice which is prone to (intra-lattice) navigation. Relational Concept Analysis (RCA), for its part, classifies several sets of objects connected through multiple binary relationships by using logical operators (quantifiers) which can be approximate. The output is a set of interconnected concept lattices, thus adding inter-lattice navigation opportunities. In this paper, we describe the web platform RCAviz, which aims to support such intra- and inter-lattice navigation. The user can select a subset of objects and attributes as a starting point for navigation. Then RCAviz shows the associated concept and its close intra- and inter-lattice neighbors. The user can access to the objects and attributes introduced and inherited in a concept. They then can navigate, i.e. zoom and pan the current view, and move from one concept to another. Additional views show the previous and the next conceptual structures, as well as an history which allows the user to browse its navigation. A navigation example is shown on a real dataset to illustrate the potential of RCAviz for ES."}]}]}]}}
