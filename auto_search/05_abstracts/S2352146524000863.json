In order to overcome the missing data for large networks a continuum traffic modeling is developed aiming at simulating traffic of very large and dense networks. The present paper aims to merge both macroscopic traffic models (i. e. the Bi-dimensional model, BIDIM) with the generic second order model (GSOM) using real data. These two models will be associated with an emission model. The method consists of proposing an interface node model to ensure the exchange between the BIDIM and the GSOM traffic model. Then a vehicle emission model COPERT was adopted to provide the emission factors based on average speeds, in order to calculate macroscopic emissions for large networks. The dynamic of the developed simulation model reproduces the propagation of the congestion between both models and the evolution of emission pollutant in the networks. Applied to real networks, Marne La Vall\u00e9e site and the A4 highway in France, the output results are very promising."}]}]}]}}
