In this paper, three Image Retrieval Systems using very basic but novel descriptors, which can retrieve black and white (binary) image, grayscale image and color image from the binary, grayscale and color image databases, respectively, were implemented. It should be noted that the features used for the binary image and grayscale image may not be efficiently applicable to the color images. Obtained results indicate the same and it additionally shows that irrespective of numbers of images in database, developed Image Retrieval Systems retrieve images in very short period of time with high accuracy. Accuracy in color image retrieval is less compared to binary and grayscale image retrieval. So, it creates a need to design highly effective features for the color image retrieval."}]}]}]}}
