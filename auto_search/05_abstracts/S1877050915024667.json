This paper presents an intrusion detection technique based on the calculation of trust of the neighboring node. In the proposed IDS, each node observes the trust level of its neighboring nodes. Based on these trust values, neighboring nodes may be declared as trustworthy, risky or malicious. Trustworthy nodes are recommended to the forwarding engine for packet forwarding purposes. The proposed scheme successfully detects Hello flood attack, jamming attack and selective forwarding attack by analyzing the network statistics and malicious node behavior. The simulation results show that network performs better when neighbor node trust management based anomaly detection technique is in place."}]}]}]}}
