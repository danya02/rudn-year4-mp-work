The continuous flow of data has proven to be a valuable resource for agile decision-making. The complexity of being able to make decisions from different sources has led to the emergence of new techniques that aim to obtain as much information as possible to relate data efficiently, taking into account multiple perspectives."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spara002", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "A new approach to clustering streaming data from different perspectives is introduced in this paper.

This approach addresses the clustering of streaming data by optimising the clustering process taking into account traditional clustering perspectives such as k-means, Clara, Pam, Fanny and MiniBatchKMeans. It has been tested using different sets of linguistic labels, achieving a high degree of compactness and separation of the cl"}, {"#name": "inter-ref", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "interref0001", "href": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "type": "simple"}, "_": "ustered data"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}]}}
