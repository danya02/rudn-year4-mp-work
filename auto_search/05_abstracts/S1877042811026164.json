However, almost all commercial applications contain their mobile versions. If we consider the importance of business and learning environments, there are still many new opportunities to integrate mobile devices with web-based services. Development of Educational Semantic Web and the implications for Web-based teaching and learning attracts great attention. This study focuses on creating a web site with semantic features taken from a student survey conducted to learn their e-learning awareness and developing an efficient search mechanism among mobile users in the learning environment. The ontology working in mobile devices benefits from adapting context and content information from a centralized system into a significant data mining application."}]}]}]}}
