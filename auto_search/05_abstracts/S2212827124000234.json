Commonly, radio-frequency identification (RFID) or code recognition techniques (e.g. Data Matrix) are applied to track the flow of workpieces through a manufacturing system and link processing data accordingly. Although the analysis of tracking data is well-examined, we still see a gap in the research on the trade-off between data acquisition, data analytics and data quality. Here, we present a framework to increase the value of existing data by enabling data analytics while addressing common pitfalls and reducing the costs of data management."}]}]}]}}
