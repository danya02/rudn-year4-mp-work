The suggested access router effectively combines both WiMAX and LR-WPAN technologies in a same device. The main motivation to propose this integration is to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services in wide area networks. Using WiMAX as backhaul service, the Internet connection can be provided for dispersed mobile LR-WPAN users over a wide area. Moreover, it enables to access all collected data in the local LR-WPAN coverage area \u2013 which is named as Senspot in this paper \u2013 by third-party clients through the Internet. Furthermore, an analytic model has been developed for the integrated network to evaluate the system's performance. Theoretical results on blocking probability of new and handover calls from WiMAX subscribers, as well as new connections from LR-WPAN Senspots in a cell of WiMAX have been investigated in terms of call/connection rates and number of allocated channels."}]}]}]}}
