Semantic information retrieval can enhance the relevancy of search results by understanding search intention and the contextual meaning of terms as they are entered by the user. In this paper, a novel method for supporting semantic information retrieval is proposed by building a domain specific ontology. A prototype of a fuzzy semantic search engine is developed and the results are compared with that of a traditional search engine."}]}]}]}}
