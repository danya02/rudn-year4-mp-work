The swift expansion of communication network causes the problem of reliability in the computer network. Reliability is the capacity of a system to do an ideal task, such as communication. In network communication, designing and consistency of a network are used to identify QOS, as the networks are becoming more wide and complex. The previous research in areas of wired reliability is not competent to deal with issues of the wireless network. There are several strategies helps us to increase the reliability of the network. The exact calculation of reliability in the network is calculated by our new algorithm and effective solution can be attained by using the artificial neural network (ANN). This paper more concentrates on reliability calculation with network flexibility."}]}]}]}}
