Graphene-based inks are positioned to lead in this domain, offering cost-effective solutions directly applicable to materials such as textiles and paper. However, graphene encounters a primary drawback due to its lack of an energy band gap, constraining its potential applications in various electronic devices. In this study, we present a novel formulation of a superconductive, flexible leather graphene antenna utilizing a tri-nanocomposite structure of Graphene Nanoplatelet/Silver/Copper (GNP/Ag/Cu), covering a wideband bandwidth from 5.2\u00a0GHz to 8.5\u00a0GHz. The electrical conductivity of the GNP/Ag/Cu sample was assessed using the four-point probe method. With each additional layer, conductivity increased from 10.473\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "7"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "\u00a0S/m to 40.218\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "7"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "\u00a0S/m, demonstrating a direct correlation between conductivity and antenna gain.
