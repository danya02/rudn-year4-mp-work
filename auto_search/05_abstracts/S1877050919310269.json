Aiming at the problems, such as lack of global planning platform for power optical transmission network, lack of precise planning for power wireless private network and lack of whole process connection for planning information, the planning forecasting strategy and planning effectiveness evaluation index system based on business priority are put forward. The whole process information management system structure is constructed, which is composed of the whole process information organization module, the technology module and the collaboration module, etc. It will cover three major stages of power communication network in an all-round way (communication network planning, construction and post-evaluation stage), and form the \"headquarters-provinces-municipalities-counties\" four-level linkage scientifically."}]}]}]}}
