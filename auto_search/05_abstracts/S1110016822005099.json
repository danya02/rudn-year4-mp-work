The tuning metallic stubs connected with the outer ring provide the provision of frequency adjustment from 2.34\u00a0GHz to 2.45\u00a0GHz, whereas middle ring stubs along with the innermost ring assists for frequency tuning from 4.68\u00a0GHz to 5.1\u00a0GHz. Due to symmetrical structure, excellent angular stability up to 60\u00b0 is achieved with near zero cross-polarization effect for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes of excitation. The measured result of the proposed MMA is analyzed that shows good similarity with the simulated one. Due to its simplistic design within nominal dimension, high absorption, flexibility to frequency tuning, wide angular stability, and no cross-polarization effect, this MMA can be a good candidate for absorber applications in wireless communication systems, especially for wave shielding from Wi-Fi frequencies."}]}]}]}]}}
