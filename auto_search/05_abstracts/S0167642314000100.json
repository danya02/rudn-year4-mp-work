First, to address this issue, this paper presents a set of requirements that any KM model or initiative should take into account to cover all aspects implied in knowing processes. These requirements were identified through a critical and evolutionary analysis of KM. Second; the paper presents a new distributed KM Conceptual Model whose building blocks are the knowledge activities involved in knowing processes. These activities are: knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge representation and retrieval. This model provides a holistic view of KM whose purpose is helping managers understand the scope of this initiative, and supplying a guide for research and implementation in organizations. In this sense, the model presents KM as a highly social rather than technological process. Third; the paper briefly describes an architecture to provide a technological support for knowledge representation and retrieval activities of the proposed KM Conceptual Model. This architecture allows implementing a distributed organizational memory that helps to represent the knowledge context through an ontological model, providing a local perspective of each knowledge domain within the organization. Strategies for knowledge annotation, knowledge retrieval, and ontology evolution are briefly described and results of preliminary performance analysis are shown. Finally; based on the available literature, a comparative analysis of different KM models shows their adequacy for previously presented requirements."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0160", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ls0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "A KM background and a discussion of failure factors associated to KM are presented."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "A set of requirements that any KM model or initiative should met is defined."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "A comprehensive KM model based on the defined requirements is depicted."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0040"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0040", "view": "all"}, "_": "An architecture for distributed organizational memory is developed."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0050"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0050", "view": "all"}, "_": "Semantic treatment of knowledge sources by information retrieval strategies is proposed."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
