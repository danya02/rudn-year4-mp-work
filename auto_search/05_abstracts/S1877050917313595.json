In such way, documents likely to be preferred by the user are presented higher. In this paper, we focus on research-paper retrieval. We propose a scientometric re-ranking approach based on the scientometric preferences of a particular researcher. The researcher creates its own definition of document quality by the mean of scientometric indicators. These indicators are the base of the scientometric score calculation, which serves to results re-ranking. The originality of our approach was the incorporation of different scientometric indicators into researcher\u2019s preferences which have significantly improved ranking performance."}]}]}]}}
