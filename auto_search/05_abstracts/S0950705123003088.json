Hence, we need a mechanism to analyse how features and their interactions influence energy footprint, but without measuring all configurations. While practical, sampling and predictive techniques base their accuracy on uniform spaces or some initial domain knowledge, which are not always possible to achieve. Indeed, analysing the energy footprint of products in large configuration spaces raises specific requirements that we explore in this work.
