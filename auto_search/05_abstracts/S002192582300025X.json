While some functional overlap is observed for the three human PP1"}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "cat"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " isoforms, they also show distinct targeting based on relative preferences for specific regulatory subunits. A well-known example is the preferential association of MYPT1 with PP1\u03b2 in the myosin phosphatase complex. In smooth muscle, MYPT1/PP1\u03b2 counteracts the muscle contraction induced by phosphorylation of the light chains of myosin by the myosin light chain kinase. This phosphatase complex is also found in nonmuscle cells, where it is targeted to both myosin and nonmyosin substrates and contributes to regulation of the balance of cytoskeletal structure and motility during cell migration and division. Although it remains unclear how MYPT1/PP1\u03b2 traffics between microtubule- and actin-associated substrates, our identification of the microtubule- and actin-binding protein SPECC1L in both the PP1\u03b2 and MYPT1 interactomes suggests that it is the missing link. Our validation of their association using coimmunoprecipitation and proximity biotinylation assays, together with the strong overlap that we observed for the SPECC1L and MYPT1 interactomes, confirmed that they exist in a stable complex in the cell. We further showed that SPECC1L binds MYPT1 directly and that it can impact the balance of the distribution of the MYPT1/PP1\u03b2 complex between the microtubule and filamentous actin networks."}]}]}]}]}}
