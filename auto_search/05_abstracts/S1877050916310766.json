The increasing rate of Internet traffic has encouraged to adapt content centric architectures to better serve content provider needs and user demand of internet based applications. These architectures have built-in network Caches and these properties improves efficiency of content delivery with high speed and great efficiency. By using Information centric architectures, users need not download content from content server despite they can easily access data from nearby caches. User requested content is independent of the location of the data by use of caching approaches and does not rely on storage and transmission methodologies of that content. There has been many researches going on which is based on caching approaches in the Content centric network. Efficient caching is essential to reduce delay and to enhance performance of the network. Along with caching, a good cache replacement scheme is also necessary to decide which content item should reside in the cache and which content should be evicted. So, in this paper, we presented a Cache content replacement (CCR) scheme for information centric network with evaluation of popularity of the content. Performance of CCR scheme will be evaluated in provision of cache hit ratio and Cache load."}]}]}]}}
