In order to support urban planning, we propose a method called AFORI (Argumentation for Formalizing and analysing Opinions on Infrastructure project) based on the AIPA abstract argumentation model, to collect, formalize and analyse the views of the different stakeholders on the project. AFORI permits to collect data from various sources (newspaper, social media\u2026), to formalize the pros and cons of argumentation relating to an infrastructure project and to provide an easier understanding of the debate. The structured formalization of the argumentation facilitates the understanding of the different points of view and their interdependence. AFORI was applied to a real case study in order to illustrate its functioning and interest."}]}]}]}}
