This depends mainly on proper authentication of users who are intended to connect to the network. with modern day technology, the credentials (password), which the legitimate user send to the access points for his/her authorization, can be sniffed and used to enter the system, compromising the system security. WPA2/PSK (Wireless Protected Access/Pre-Shared Key) has a vulnerability which allows an attacker to perform Man-in-the-middle attack by capturing the handshake sent by the legitimate user for authentication. The captured handshake can be used to recover the password using dictionary attack or can be brute forced. To overcome the short comings of the current system, the proposed method uses Frequency Hopping Technique to secure the MIC(Message Integrity Code) before transmitting it. This method reduces the possibility of brute forcing the password, even if the handshake is captured."}]}]}]}}
