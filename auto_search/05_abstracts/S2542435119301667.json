Billions of wireless sensors are expected to be installed over the coming decade, with almost half to be located inside buildings. Currently, the use of batteries to power these devices places significant constraints on their power consumption, where the range and frequency of data transmission are curtailed to achieve sufficient battery life, and the range of applications is also limited to the ones that allow battery replacement. Additional operation and maintenance costs are also incurred by providing replacement batteries."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "Indoor photovoltaics has the potential to solve these hardware issues, providing greater reliability and operational lifetimes in wireless sensor networks.
