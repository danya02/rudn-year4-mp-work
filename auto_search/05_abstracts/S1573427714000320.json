Survivability is of critical importance, making high levels of availability essential, given the increased level of infrastructure vulnerability to natural disasters, massive power failures, and malicious attacks. A typical approach to the design of resilient optical networks is through protection schemes that predetermine and reserve protection resources based on single and double link-failure scenarios. In this paper we propose a planning heuristic for WDM networks that computes the resource capacity required to transport the traffic demand and protect the optical connections while meeting availability requirements in scenarios of multiple link failures. The method is based on two algorithms, one for path-selection and the other for computing connection unavailability. The numerical results show that the method allows network topology to be exploited to significantly reduce connection unavailability."}]}]}]}}
