In fact, (SGN) becomes an alternative source of power since it provides efficiency and reliability power consumption. Thus, SG architecture includes several communication schemes to ensure the best transmission of power and satisfy the consumer\u2019s requirement. To reach these ambitions, the transmission must be established at time and without error. In the traditional transmission, every consumer transmits the power demand using a TDMA mechanism which prolongs the delay. In this paper, the purpose is to suggest a model that can quickly transmit the power demand and achieve a good performance in terms of delay. The scheme is called Cooperative Wireless Transmission for Smart Neighbor Area Network (CWT). The cooperative means that all consumers can participate and coordinate between them to transmit the total power. So, the first purpose is to gather the total power of all consumers simultaneously and rapidly by employing QPSK modulation so that to improve the throughput, the second one is to evaluate the performance of CWT in terms of Cooperative Symbol Error Rate (CSER) and Estimated Power (EP). All results are presented using numerical simulations"}]}]}]}}
