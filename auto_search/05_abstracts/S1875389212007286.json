Multicast is a mode of communication transmission oriented to group computing, which sends the data to a group of host computers by using single source address. In a typical mobile Ad Hoc Network environment, multicast has a significant meaning. On the one hand, the users of mobile Ad Hoc Network usually need to form collaborative working groups; on the other hand, this is also an important means of fully using the broadcast performances of wireless communication and effectively using the limited wireless channel resources. This paper summarizes and comparatively analyzes the routing mechanisms of various existing multicast routing protocols according to the characteristics of mobile Ad Hoc network."}]}]}]}}
