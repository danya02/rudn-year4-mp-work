There are several other parameters (such as dropping header packets in case of congestion in the network or alternate path in case of link failure) which should be considered for making efficient routing decision. In recent years, active research in the field of routing protocols has been done to make routing decision based on more than one constraint. Fuzzy inference system is one such system which offers a natural way of accepting multiple input constraints which are uncertain and imprecise in nature. This paper aims at analyzing the performance of AODV and DSR routing protocols using fuzzy inference system. Further the behavior of these protocols is analyzed in both cases (with and without fuzzy inference system)."}]}]}]}}
