The CAD model is segmented into several relevant sub-parts. Then, attach semantic descriptions and annotations to these sub-parts. Finally, evaluate the similarity of the models based on the semantic ontology 3D CAD model. The experimental results show the efficiency of this method to meet the requirements of engineering retrieval and reuse of design and manufacture."}]}]}]}}
