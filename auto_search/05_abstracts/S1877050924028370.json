Therefore, underground engineering construction has received widespread attention. The application of Wireless Sensing Network (WSN) technology in civil engineering structural monitoring meets the intelligent monitoring needs of tunnel construction and solves the problem of construction safety monitoring. This study combines statistical analysis, theoretical research, numerical simulation, BIM technology, and on-site verification methods to systematically explore the perception and visualization management of safety risks in subway construction. The application of wireless monitoring technology has verified the monitoring effect of wireless laser ranging and wireless inclination sensors during the construction period. The results show that under timely support conditions, the tunnel structure remains basically safe. For weak stratum tunnels, numerical simulation and backward advanced deep hole grouting pre reinforcement technology are studied to ensure the stability of the soil layer around the tunnel. At the same time, BIM technology is used to construct a tunnel model, visualize the construction process, and develop an intelligent sensing control system for real-time monitoring and risk warning."}]}]}]}}
