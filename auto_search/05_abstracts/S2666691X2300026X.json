Following a consolidated track in the literature, choice probabilities and correlations of the Multinomial Probit (MNP) model are taken as targets. Laboratory experiments on small/medium-size networks are illustrated, also leveraging a procedure for practical calculation of correlations of any GEV models. Results show that models with inherent limitations in the coverage of the domain of feasible correlations yield unsatisfactory performance, whilst the specifications of the CoNL proposed in the paper appear the best in fitting both MNP correlations and probabilities. The performance of the models is appreciably ameliorated by introducing lower bounds to the nesting parameters. Overall, the paper provides guides for the practical application of tested models."}]}]}]}}
