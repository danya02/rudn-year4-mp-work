Due to the influence of such factors as sea conditions, drifting and diffusion of spilled oil and the configuration of emergency vessels; however, the coordination degree of the operation of on-site emergency vessels is critical to the efficiency and effectiveness of oil spill disposal. In this paper, we, based upon the characteristics of marine oil spill emergency disposal environment and the requirements for emergency vessel scheduling, put forward a whole set of operation scheduling scheme of marine oil spill emergency vessels, integrating the ENC, GPS, AIS, wireless network and oil spill monitoring technologies, to improve the capacity of marine oil spill disposal."}]}]}]}}
