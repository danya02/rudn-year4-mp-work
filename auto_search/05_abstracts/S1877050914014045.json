In cellular network case, the large number of devices lead to communication problem caused by collisions between the senders. In this work we study the collision probability, saturation throughput and packet error rate for the carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol with request to send and clear to send (RTS/CTS) mechanism in the case of frequency band division. We propose in this paper a modified version of CSMA/CA-RTS/CTS to be compatible with the band repartition technique and we prove that an important gain is introduced in terms of system performance especially for loaded networks. Different backoff stage numbers with different finite retransmission limit values are investigated. Simulations highlight that dividing the RTS band into independent channels reduces drastically the RTS collision probability and in particular the packet error rate. A gain in terms of saturation throughput is also demonstrated especially in charged networks mode."}]}]}]}]}}
