Our networks were developed using data from six UK hospitals from three National Health Service (NHS) Trusts (University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, and University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust) collectively contributing 2\u2009513\u2009546 chest x-ray studies taken from a 13-year period (2006\u201319), which yielded 1\u2009940\u2009508 usable free-text radiological reports written by the contemporary assessing radiologist (collectively referred to as the \u201chistoric reporters\u201d) and 1\u2009896\u2009034 frontal images. Chest x-rays were labelled using a taxonomy of 37 findings by a custom-trained natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, X-Raydar-NLP, from the original free-text reports. X-Raydar-NLP was trained on 23\u2009230 manually annotated reports and tested on 4551 reports from all hospitals. 1\u2009694\u2009921 labelled images from the training set and 89\u2009238 from the validation set were then used to train a multi-label image classifier. Our algorithms were evaluated on three retrospective datasets: a set of exams sampled randomly from the full NHS dataset reported during clinical practice and annotated using NLP (n=103\u2009328); a consensus set sampled from all six hospitals annotated by three expert radiologists (two independent annotators for each image and a third consultant to facilitate disagreement resolution) under research conditions (n=1427); and an independent dataset, MIMIC-CXR, consisting of NLP-annotated exams (n=252\u2009374)."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "ceabs30", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "cestitle40"}, "_": "Findings"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spara140", "view": "all"}, "_": "X-Raydar achieved a mean AUC of 0\u00b7919 (SD 0\u00b7039) on the auto-labelled set, 0\u00b7864 (0\u00b7102) on the consensus set, and 0\u00b7842 (0\u00b7074) on the MIMIC-CXR test, demonstrating similar performance to the historic clinical radiologist reporters, as assessed on the consensus set, for multiple clinically important findings, including pneumothorax, parenchymal opacification, and parenchymal mass or nodules.
