The range of the potential application of FSO networks is extensive, from home to satellite. However, FSO networks have not been popularized because of insufficient availability and reliability. Researchers have focused on the problems in the physical layer in order to exploit the properties of wireless optical channels. However, recent technological developments with successful results make it practical to explore the advantages of the high bandwidth. Some researchers have begun to focus on the problems of network and upper layers in FSO networks. In this survey, we classify prospective global FSO networks into three subnetworks and give an account of them. We also present state-of-the-art research and discuss what kinds of challenges exist."}]}]}]}}
