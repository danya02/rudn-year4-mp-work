The current trend of searching for music by means of music consumers\u02bc keywords/tags is unable to provide satisfactory search results. It is argued that search and retrieval of music can be significantly improved provided end-users\u02bc tags are associated with semantic information in terms of acoustic metadata \u2013 the latter being easy to extract automatically from digital music items. This paper presents a lightweight ontology that will enable music producers to annotate music against MPEG-7 description (with its acoustic metadata) and the generated annotation may in turn be used to deliver meaningful search results.
