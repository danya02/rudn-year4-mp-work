The proposed propagation mechanism disseminates the source types of energies to all nodes while it advertises a proposed path attribute called minimum path emission. The paper shows how the dynamic negotiation protocol along with the proposed traffic engineering metric improves the performance of green algorithms. This mechanism helps service providers to control the network Co2 emission level in WDM networks and keep the network as green as possible."}]}]}]}}
