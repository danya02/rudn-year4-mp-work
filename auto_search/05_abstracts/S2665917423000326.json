Multiple (RFID) components must be installed in order to do this (readers, tags, computer systems, and so on). Networks are growing more expensive and sophisticated as a result of the requirement to add more readers. To supply strong service for (RFID) systems, figuring out the optimal quantity, position, and reader settings is a considerable task. Good planning ensures that (RFID) networks have (the coverage, load balancing, and reader overlapping they need). This problem is well-studied in literary works as a radio frequency identification network planning problem. In this paper, a number of algorithms that were used to improve the RFID Network Planning (RNP) model."}]}]}]}}
