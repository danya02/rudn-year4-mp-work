For developers and researchers it represents a giant multilingual database of concepts and semantic relations, a potential resource for natural language processing and many other research areas. This paper introduces the Wikipedia Miner toolkit, an open-source software system that allows researchers and developers to integrate Wikipedia\u02bcs rich semantics into their own applications. The toolkit creates databases that contain summarized versions of Wikipedia\u02bcs content and structure, and includes a Java API to provide access to them. Wikipedia\u02bcs articles, categories and redirects are represented as classes, and can be efficiently searched, browsed, and iterated over. Advanced features include parallelized processing of Wikipedia dumps, machine-learned semantic relatedness measures and annotation features, and XML-based web services. Wikipedia Miner is intended to be a platform for sharing data mining techniques."}]}]}]}}
