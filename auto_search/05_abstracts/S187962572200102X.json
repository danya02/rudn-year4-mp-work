Dynamic changes in protein abundance, subcellular localisation, post-translational modifications and interactions with other biomolecules govern these processes. Proteomics is therefore an ideal experimental tool to discover novel mechanisms of host antiviral immunity. Additional information can be gleaned both about host and virus by systematic analysis of viral immune evasion strategies. In this review, we summarise recent advances in proteomic technologies and their application to antiviral innate immunity."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0005"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Antiviral innate immunity is regulated by changes in cellular proteins."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "These include changes in abundance, localisation, interaction and PTMs."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Viral immune evasion strategies highlight critical host defences."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Proteomic analysis of viral infection can therefore discover antiviral mechanisms."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
