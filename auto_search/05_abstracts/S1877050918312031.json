However, the proper ontology construction processes and their updating of various data sources, require a huge effort and well-adjusted mechanisms to their extraction, positioning and sharing. In this context, the application of a proper Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) system may help in solving these problems. The paper is a successful attempt to purvey state-of-the-art of selected OBIE systems, followed by the process of taxonomy construction and aftermath knowledge systematization of particular OBIE approaches."}]}]}]}}
