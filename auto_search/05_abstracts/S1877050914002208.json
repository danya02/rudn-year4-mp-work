While previous works on semantic relation automatic acquisition relied on annotated text corpus, it is still unclear how to develop more generic methods to meet the needs of identifying related event pairs and extracting event-arguments (especially the predicate, subject and object). Motivated by this limitation, we develop a three-phased approach that acquires causality from the Web text. First, we use explicit connective markers (such as \u201cbecause\u201d) as linguistic cues to discover causal related events. Next, we extract the event-arguments based on local dependency parse trees of event expressions. At the last step, we propose a statistical model to measure the potential causal relations. The results of our empirical evaluations on a large-scale Web text corpus show that (a) the use of local dependency tree extensively improves both the accuracy and recall of event-arguments extraction task, and (b) our measure improves the traditional PMI method."}]}]}]}}
