However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing experimental study focused on state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for the RC-TLR problem, and there is also a lack of uniform benchmarks for evaluating new methods in the field. We developed a framework to identify SOTA methods using the Systematic Literature Review method and applied it to research in the RC-TLR field from 2018 to 2023. Through experiments replication on 13 datasets using 6 methods, we observed that for information retrieval-based methods, Close Relations between Target artifacts-based method (CRT), TraceAbility Recovery by Consensual biTerms (TAROT), and Fine-grained TLR (FTLR) performed well on COEST dataset, while Combining Part-Of-Speech with information-retrieval techniques (Conpos) and TAROT achieve promising results in large datasets. As concerns machine learning-based methods, Random Forest consistently exhibits strong performances on all datasets. We hope that this study can provide a comparative benchmark for performance evaluation in the RC-TLR field. The resource repository that we have established is expected to alleviate the workload of researchers in performance analysis, and promote progress of the field."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e7151", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e7152"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e7154", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e7155", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e7157"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e7158"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e7161", "view": "all"}, "_": "The first SOTA study in the requirements-to-code link recovery task."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e7163"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e7166", "view": "all"}, "_": "Providing the software engineering community with a universal framework for identifying SOTA methods."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e7168"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e7171", "view": "all"}, "_": "Systematically organized and open-sourced the relevant resources in the requirements-code traceability link recovery task."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
