The geophysical data is acquired in a tailings area in the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine, Finland, using seismic refraction (SR) and electric resistivity imaging (ERI) techniques.

ERI inversion model data was used for facies analysis and interpretation in terms of other subsurface variables (e.g., water saturation, salinity). For this, a first-order derivative (gradient approach) and a second-order derivative combined with a Gaussian filter (Laplacian approach) were applied to highlight facies and transition zones. The approach embeds the data as scalar functions within a space domain defined by the model local structure. When applied to the ERI data, the gradient and the Laplacian functions captured the local extrema and the minimum threshold crossings respectively enhancing local geoelectric zones and layered contacts in line with field observations. This paper demonstrated that such image analysis can be proposed for interpretation of geophysical data in terms of segmentation and analysis of local facies, relevant in model conceptualization and parameterization of hydrogeological models."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0010", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0055", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "SR and ERI characterized the inner structure of tailings facilities."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Saline water flow paths in tailings media revealed by ERI."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "ERI and differential operators for geoelectric zoning and facies delineation."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
