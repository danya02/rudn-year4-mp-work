Differentiating from other forms of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is essential, given the various therapeutic approaches. The IPF course is now unpredictable for individual patients, although some genetic factors and several biomarkers have already been associated with various IPF prognoses. Since its early stages, IPF may be asymptomatic, leading to a delayed diagnosis. The present review critically examines the recent literature on molecular biomarkers potentially useful in IPF diagnostics. The examined biomarkers are grouped into breath and sputum biomarkers, serologically assessed extracellular matrix neoepitope markers, and oxidative stress biomarkers in lung tissue. Fibroblasts and complete blood count have also gained recent interest in that respect. Although several biomarker candidates have been profiled, there has yet to be a single biomarker that proved specific to the IPF disease. Nevertheless, various IPF biomarkers have been used in preclinical and clinical trials to verify their predictive and monitoring potential."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Interstitial lung disease epidemiology origin is still unknown"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Current diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF, is by symptoms"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Determining breath and sputum biomarkers and neoepitopes helps diagnose IPF"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT are imaged for IPF diagnosis"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "Oxidative stress biomarkers are determined, and a complete blood count is performed in IPF diagnosis"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
