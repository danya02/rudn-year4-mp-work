This calls for automated techniques to analyze large collections of those artifacts to manage model-* ecosystems. SAMOS is a framework to address this challenge: it treats model-* artifacts as data, and applies various techniques\u2014ranging from information retrieval to machine learning\u2014to analyze those artifacts in a holistic, scalable and efficient way. Such analyses can help to understand and manage those ecosystems."}]}]}]}}
