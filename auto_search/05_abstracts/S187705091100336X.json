Measuring the utilization of assets such as a production tool is simple as the output is amenable to measurement. However, how do we measure the utilization of assets that are mobile (Fork-Lift-Trucks, Dozers, Loaders, etc.)? On most occasions, the number of mobile assets needed is estimated on a conservative back of the envelope calculation that directly results in overbuying the assets and consequently, a lower utilization rate. In this paper, we have developed an IEEE 802.15.4 based Real Time Location System (RTLS) incorporating a closed loop control to capture the mobility and utilization patterns of mobile assets. We report our experiences and results from the deployment of such a system to track the movement of Fork-Lift-Trucks in the factory premises of a manufacturing plant in India. We show the insights generated from the utilization patterns, the bottlenecks and formulate an optimization problem that gives the best possible utilization rate and the number of assets needed for the actual demand. Our results not only show the technical feasibility of the system in a real-life scenario but more importantly, depict the value created by a real-time tracking system."}]}]}]}}
