In particular, we are interested in finding the optimal management of the network intersections in order to reduce traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution. So, we consider two different multi-objective control problems (the former from a cooperative viewpoint, the latter within a hierarchical paradigm), propose a complete numerical algorithm to solve them, and, finally, present several numerical tests for a realistic case posed in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (Mexico), where the possibilities of our methodology are shown."}]}]}]}}
