As such, there is an increasing urgency for the development of advanced and effective wireless technologies that can fulfil the new requirements for interconnected devices and services deployed in households. Tri-band Wi-Fi 6E equipment addresses these needs by reducing the network congestion and enhancing the performance across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. However, improper band management can lead to frequent interference and network issues. As such, this work introduces a dynamic Wi-Fi link orchestration solution that follows a heuristic model. This approach aims to optimize the network layout and channel allocation based on device metrics, utilizing the EasyMesh specification for simplified network setup and management. The model was implemented and tested in a residential environment network, using EasyMesh and tri-band Wi-Fi 6E devices. Results show the effectiveness of the model in improving network capacity and adapting the links to the current traffic, outperforming the initial and base network configuration."}]}]}]}}
