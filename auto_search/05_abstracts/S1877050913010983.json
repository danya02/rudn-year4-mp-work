An arbitrary optical network has been considered with different distances between the nodes and different link capacities. A traffic matrix is assumed for the optical network at an instance and the corresponding virtual topology design is solved by using the mixed integer linear formulation that includes lightpath routing, wavelength assignment, wavelength continuity, flow routing, and traffic losses."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spar0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The numerical optimization results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed MILP formulation and superior network performances, validating the proposed framework for optimal virtual topology designs.
