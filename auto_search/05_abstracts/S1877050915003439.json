Such an activity can prove to be tedious as the user would go through various websites and compare the parameters like price, delivery charges and time and availability before buying it. Therefore, the solution to this problem is a one-for-all website, where the user is suggested with the best-buy option after comparing the product on the basis of different parameters on various websites. Also, the user is provided with an estimated price at which a product can be sold for maximum profit. Therefore, CompareKart would suggest the user with the most optimal website to sell the product on after comparing the past sale records and prices on various websites."}]}]}]}}
