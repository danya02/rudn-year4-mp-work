Currently, Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) scans are used to diagnose this condition. However, to manually locate the presence of a PE in the scan is laborious. In this paper, the detection of PE and prediction of its features like location, Right Ventricle to Left Ventricle (RV/LV) ratio, and chronicity are automated. First, for the detection of the embolisms, image features from the RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT (RSPECT) dataset - containing over 12,000 CTPA studies, are extracted by several pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - AlexNet, Inception V3, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50. Then, various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers are trained on these features and their performances are compared. Second, for the prediction of labels, multi-label classification is performed by training these networks with Binary Cross Entropy Logits (BCE Logits) loss. The results showed that for the detection task, k-NN classifier trained on ResNet-50 features achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.98 with 1.7 false positives per scan and an AUROC score of 97.4%. This system also improved on the state-of-the-art sensitivity score by 0.0975 and AUROC score by 3.4%. For multi-label classification, ResNet-18 performed comparatively better with the best validation loss of 0.07 and weighted macro-average ROC AUC score of 0.61."}]}]}]}}
