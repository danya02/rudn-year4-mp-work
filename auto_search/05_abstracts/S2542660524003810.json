This study addresses the critical challenge of cell scheduling within TSCH MAC, emphasising the importance of selecting scheduling mechanisms based on application-specific quality of service parameters. Despite numerous proposals and evaluations, the lack of standardised scheduling methods and comprehensive performance metrics remains a significant obstacle. Traditional network metrics often fail to capture key issues in TSCH-based mesh networks, potentially overlooking indicators of network stability. To address this gap, we examine both application and network metrics from a mesh network perspective and propose a set of complementary metrics tailored to the characteristics of TSCH. These metrics provide a more detailed evaluation of how scheduling impacts network reliability and efficiency. Given the diverse applications and configurations in industrial environments, this study offers insights into employing these complementary metrics for a more accurate assessment of the impact of TSCH scheduling. Ultimately, our approach aims to improve TSCH scheduling evaluation and contribute to advancing industrial wireless communication systems."}]}]}]}}
