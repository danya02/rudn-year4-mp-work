This study evaluates metadata completeness and assesses the alignment with the FAIR principles using all 212 datasets from NIST's Computer Forensic Reference DataSet Portal (CFReDS). The findings underscore deficiencies in metadata quality and FAIR compliance, emphasizing the need for improved data management standards. Based on our critical review, we then propose and discuss various approaches to improve the status quo."}]}]}]}}
