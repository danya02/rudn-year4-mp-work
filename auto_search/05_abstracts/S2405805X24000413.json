Further computational analysis revealed that the reconstitution of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) network of second-shell residues around the active site of FoFS influences the orientation of the aromatic residue W69 within the first-shell catalytic pocket. Thus, the dynamic orientation of W69 alters the carbocation transport, leading to the production of diverse ring system skeletons. These findings enhance our knowledge on understanding the molecular mechanisms, which could be applied on protein engineering terpene synthases on regulating the terpene skeletons."}]}]}]}]}}
