However, its dynamic communication performance has not been evaluated yet, we have proposed a deadlock free dimension order routing algorithm using 4 virtual channels. In this paper, The TOPAZ simulator is used to evaluate the dynamic communication performance of a VMMN with virtual cut-through flow control under uniform traffic pattern. We found that the VMMN dynamic communication performance is better than that of the hierarchical TESH network and its counter rival MMN."}]}]}]}}
