An integral part of ensuring a secure power supply system is a power communication system. Due to the high and sustained performance requirements of power communication systems, electric companies prefer to construct their own communication networks privately rather than relying solely on a public communication system. The focus of this paper is on the optimal topological design of a power communication network. Based on advanced optimization models in public communication networks, and taking into account the specific Quality of Service, as demanded by various applications, such as protection, SCADA, voice, etc., an optimization model (PC/ISO) has been developed. The PC/ISO requires tedious numerical processing. Hence, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the optimization problem. In order to demonstrate the application of the proposed model for a power system communication network design and in order to evaluate GA solver results, a case study on designing the optimal communication network topology of one of the Iranian Regional Electric Companies has been conducted. The results suggest that the PC/ISO model and its GA solver are entirely viable and offer a simple, accurate, and cost effective solution."}]}]}]}}
