While speaking, people often use heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes, hand movement, etc. to reveal sarcastic. In the textual data, these tonal and gestural clues are missing, making sarcasm detection very difficult for an average human. Due to these challenges, researchers show interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets. Rapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a Hadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and processes it with a set of algorithms which identifies sarcastic sentiment effectively. We observe that the elapse time for analyzing and processing under Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited for real time streaming tweets."}]}]}]}}
