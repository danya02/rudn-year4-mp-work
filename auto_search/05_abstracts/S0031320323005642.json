Stroke is one of the most serious and potentially fatal conditions among the major cardiovascular disorders. We are introducing a deep-learning-based method for early diagnosis of facial paralysis diseases such as stroke and Bell's palsy. Recognizing the costs associated with traditional diagnostic techniques like magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan images, our model employs a multi-task network, integrating face parsing, facial asymmetry parsing, and category enhancement. Spatial inconsistencies are addressed via a depth-map estimation module that leverages an instance-specific kernel approach. To clarify the boundaries of facial components, we use category edge detection with a foreground attention module, generating generic geometric structures and detailed semantic cues. Our model is trained on two datasets, comprising individuals with regular smiles and those with one-sided facial weakness. This cost-effective, easily accessible solution can streamline the diagnostic process, minimizing data gaps, and reducing needless rescreening and intervention costs."}]}]}]}}
