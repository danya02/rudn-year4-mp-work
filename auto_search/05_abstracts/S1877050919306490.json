WordNet is a lexical dictionary conceptually organized, where each concept has several characteristics: Synsets and Glosses. Synset represent sets of synonyms of a given word and Glosses are a short description. In this paper, we propose a new approach for calculating semantic similarity between two concepts. The proposed method is based on set theory\u2019s concepts and WordNet properties, by calculating the relatedness between the synsets\u2019 and glosses\u2019s of the two concepts."}]}]}]}}
