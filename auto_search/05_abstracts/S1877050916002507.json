Multimedia applications need a lot more bandwidth and have different QoS requirements than the applications that were used in early years of the internet. The main reason for the poor quality of voice over IP is because we are transmitting the real time applications over the IP network which is mainly meant to transfer only data and not for voice transmission. The purpose of this paper is to check the performance of VOIP application under different CODEC's such as G.711, G.729 and G.723.1 over wireless network with and without silence suppression. Another issue addressed in this paper is the effect of increasing nodes on voice transmission for the different codecs. Parameters like media access delay and throughput are taken into consideration. Simulation is performed using OPNET modeler simulator."}]}]}]}}
