To be able to ensure high quality and enable a traceability of different production and product characteristics (e.g. energy consumption, material), a tracking and tracing concept is required. In this paper, a practical tracking and tracing concept throughout the production of LIB cells, enabling inline data-driven applications, is introduced. As a part of this concept an intelligent tracking and tracing platform is shown, which allows the generation of a pre-clustered data sets to facilitate future data-driven applications."}]}]}]}}
