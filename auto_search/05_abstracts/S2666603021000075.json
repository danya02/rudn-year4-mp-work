Under crowded scenarios like airports, shopping centers, and stadiums, WLANs can be easily congested due to their random access nature and limited operational capability. This may result in a reduced user multimedia experience. With a proper Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) allocation and scheduling scheme, the user service quality could be improved under such scenarios. In this paper, a Congestion-Aware Transmission Opportunity (CA-TXOP) scheme is proposed, allocating transmission resources by considering network level congestion and information like buffer status, channel quality, and data rates. The CA-TXOP scheme prioritizes congested and noncongested user stations and improves the overall network performance. Simulation results show that the CA-TXOP scheme attained 45%, 35%, and 20% enhancement compared with Fixed, Bi-level, and FRA-TXOP scheduling schemes. Such scheme applies to future congested scenarios like smart buildings and organizations that require satisfying video quality to all the user stations."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0015", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Congestion in Wireless LANs is one of the key performance issues."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "TXOP in 802.11ac is unable to provide throughput and fairness guarantee with the increase in user traffic."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "TXOP allocation based on varying data demands and channel qualities."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Improved network performance through congestion aware resource allocation and scheduling."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
