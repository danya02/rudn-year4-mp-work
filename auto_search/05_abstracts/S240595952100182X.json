Now, research interest in wireless communication is quickly shifting to the next generation mobile system, 6G. This paper envisions the 6G as a union of physical space, cyberspace, and connectivity with intelligence. Also, interactivity is a critical component to provide users with a truly immersive experience. In this paper, 6G usage scenarios and use cases which cannot be properly supported under the 5G regime are proposed. Major key performance indicators (KPIs) to support these use cases are considered. The 6G-related state-of-the-art technologies and standardization activities are discussed in terms of interactivity, intelligence and connectivity. Also, future works to be accomplished for the completion of 6G are shortly stated."}]}]}]}}
