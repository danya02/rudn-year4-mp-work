Federated Deep Learning (FDL) is a novel distributed machine learning technology and is able to address the challenges like data security, privacy risks, and huge communication overheads from big raw data sets. However, FDL can only guarantee data security and privacy among multiple clients during data training. If the data sets stored locally in clients are corrupted, including being tampered with and lost, the training results of the FDL in intelligent IoVs must be negatively affected. In this paper, we are the first to design a secure data auditing protocol to guarantee the integrity and availability of data sets in FDL-empowered IoVs. Specifically, the cuckoo filter and Reed-Solomon codes are utilized to guarantee error tolerance, including efficient corrupted data locating and recovery. In addition, a novel data structure, Skip Hash Table\u00a0(SHT) is designed to optimize data dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the security of the scheme with the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption on bilinear groups. Sufficient theoretical analyses and performance evaluations demonstrate the security and efficiency of our scheme for data sets in FDL-empowered IoVs."}]}]}]}}
