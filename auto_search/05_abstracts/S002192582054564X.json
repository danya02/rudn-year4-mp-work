A partial list of putative HERG-interacting proteins includes several known components of the cytosolic chaperone system, including Hsc70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein), Hsp90 (90-kDa heat shock protein), Hdj-2, Hop (Hsp-organizing protein), and Bag-2 (BCL-associated athanogene 2). In addition, two membrane-integrated proteins were identified, calnexin and FKBP38 (38-kDa FK506-binding protein, FKBP8). We show that FKBP38 immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with HERG in our cellular system. Importantly, small interfering RNA knock down of FKBP38 causes a reduction of HERG trafficking, and overexpression of FKBP38 is able to partially rescue the LQT2 trafficking mutant F805C. We propose that FKBP38 is a co-chaperone of HERG and contributes via the Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone system to the trafficking of wild type and mutant HERG potassium channels."}]}]}]}]}}
