Nevertheless, several limitations restrict its applicability. First, FCS is data hungry, requiring 50,000 frames at 1-ms time resolution to obtain accurate parameter estimates. Second, the data size makes evaluation slow. Third, as FCS evaluation is model dependent, data evaluation is significantly slowed unless analytic models are available. Here, we introduce two convolutional neural networks\u2014"}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "FCSNet"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "ImFCSNet"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "\u2014for correlation and intensity trace analysis, respectively.
