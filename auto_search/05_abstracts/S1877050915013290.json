Traditionally, two types of re-transmission have been proposed for the data-loss, namely, End-to-End loss recovery (E2E) and per hop. In these mechanisms, lost packets are re-transmitted from a source node or an intermediate node with a low success rate.

This paper proposes a Reliable Proliferation Routing with low Duty Cycle [RPRDC] in WSNs that integrates three core concepts namely, (i) reliable path finder, (ii) a randomized dispersity, and (iii) forwarding. Simulation results demonstrates that packet successful delivery rate can be maintained upto 93% in RPRDC and outperform Proliferation Routing"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "1"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}]}}
