The design offers flexibility for frequency-selective applications in wireless communication due to its small size, high refractive index, and the feature that it can provide frequency selectivity by tuning. Different solid materials, earth materials, hydrocarbon, and Arlon substrates are used for sensing applications. The proposed metamaterial offers greater flexibility and adaptability due to the incorporation of tunable split ring resonators. This makes it suitable for various wireless communication and sensing applications."}]}]}]}]}}
