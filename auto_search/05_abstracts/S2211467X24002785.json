The novel approach leads to more accurate results while reaching faster calculation times. In particular, it successfully avoids false inter-zonal meshing. Consequently, the more accurate modelling of inter-cluster connections results in up to 41% higher grid expansion needs and significantly changed spatial allocations of network and storage expansion. Where geographical or political borders (e.g. the former inner-German border) have led to scarcely interconnected grid topologies (especially on the sub-transmission grid level), the impact is particularly high.
