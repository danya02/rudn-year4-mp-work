Two-thirds of microdeletions in azoospermic men were AZFa, AZFb, AZFb+c, or complete Yq deletions. Virtually all microdeletions in oligozoospermic patients were AZFc deletions. Seven hundred eighteen patients underwent microdissection TESE, including 41 with microdeletions. Microdissection TESE failed in all patients with AZFa, AZFb, AZFb+c, and complete Yq deletions. Sperm were retrieved in 15/21 AZFc deleted patients (71.4%). The presence of an AZFc deletion was associated with increased likelihood of sperm retrieval when compared with the 48.8% retrieval rate in 385 idiopathically azoospermic men who consecutively underwent microdissection TESE at our institution during the study period. Clinical pregnancy was achieved in 10/15 azoospermic AZFc deleted patients for whom sperm were successfully retrieved."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "aep-abstract-sec-id10"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "_": "Conclusion(s)"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all"}, "_": "Of azoospermic and severely oligozoospermic American men, 10% harbor Y microdeletions that alter prognosis for surgical sperm retrieval and are vertically transmissible.
