With the explosion of the abundant data present on social media, it has become important to analyze this text for seeking information and use it for the advantage of various applications and people. From past few years, this task of automatic summarization has stirred the interest among communities of Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, especially when it comes to opinion summarization. Opinions play a pivotal role in decision making in the society. Other's opinions and suggestions are the base for an individual or a company while making decisions. In this paper, we propose a graph based technique that generates summaries of redundant opinions and uses sentiment analysis to combine the statements. The summaries thus generated are abstraction based summaries and are well formed to convey the gist of the text."}]}]}]}}
