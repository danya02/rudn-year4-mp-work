Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) being one of such networks has its own limitations in terms of resource discovery with unstable topology and paths through the networks. So eventually traditional searching techniques are still widely used. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model is the major candidate for the internet traffic mainly due to its decentralized nature. This article evaluates classic flooding, random walk and gossip based resource discovery algorithms under mobile peer-to-peer (MP2P) networks and studied their performance. Further we suggest way to improve these algorithms to suit and work better under MANET. We compare the performance in terms of success rate, query response time, network overhead, battery power consumed, overall dropped packets, MAC load, network bandwidth, packet delivery ratio, network routing load and end to end delay. The experiments are validated through NS-2 simulations."}]}]}]}}
