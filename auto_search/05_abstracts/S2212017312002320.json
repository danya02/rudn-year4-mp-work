This architecture has major drawback of losing bandwidth over multiple hops thereby resulting in poor quality of service (QoS) at nodes separated by more than two hops. This paper proposes a three step approach to guarantee bandwidth demand at each node of the network thereby providing high quality of service even to nodes separated by large distances from each other. The authors have presented a novel method for clustering the nodes and load sharing amongst the clusters based on graph partitioning approach. This work also presents a system and method of integrating Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) with wired network for further increase in the QoS."}]}]}]}}
