A great amount of real-time data of product manufacturing cycle (PMC) is generated which needs to be properly stored and evaluated. In the present study, an architecture of data analytics for product manufacturing cycle of fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique of 3D printing was proposed. By using this architecture, data accessibility and 3DP product related knowledge had been realized. Concentrating on FDM method of the PMC, the main technologies were established to implement the data analytics. A case study was presented for architecture verification and discussed in details. It is concluded that the projected architecture helped manufacturers and customers, and also beneficial for improvement of product quality with the enhancement in productivity."}]}]}]}}
