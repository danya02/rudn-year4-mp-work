In wireless communications, radio spectrum is becoming a limited resource since it is shared by all nodes in the range of its transmitters. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technique is the chosen channel accessing in next generation wireless cellular networks for attaining high spectrum efficiency and to reduce frequency-selective fading. Compared to present generation wireless networks, there is a denser cellular deployment in next generation wireless networks. In the multi-cell scenario, Inter Cell Interference (ICI) has become a major issue of concern since it leads to performance degradation. This paper presents a radio resource management (RRM) scheme which includes resource allocation involving ICI reduction, power control based on optimal power allocation solutions which emphasize energy consumption and scheduling which enhances cell edge user's performance in future wireless networks."}]}]}]}}
