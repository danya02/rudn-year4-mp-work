Using a deductive methodology on the literature covering the resilience of power systems, we reviewed more than two hundred peer-reviewed articles spanning the 2010\u20132019 decade. We find that there is vacuum on the level of integration that considers the interdependence of local or decentralized decision making in an adaptive power system. This gap is widened by the absence of policies to enhance resilience in power networks. While there is significant coverage and convergence of research on algorithms for solving the multi-objective problem in optimization routines, there are still uncharted territories on how to incorporate system degradation while designing these self-restoration systems. We posit that a shift to a smarter, cleaner and more resilient power network requires sustained investments rather than disaster-induced responses."}]}]}]}}
