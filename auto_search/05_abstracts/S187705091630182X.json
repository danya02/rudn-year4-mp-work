With the recent upcoming technologies of network programmability like SDN may be effectively integrated to create a communication platform. In this work, we present the details of our preliminary study of how to determine the effectiveness of an approach to build a cluster network using Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We will provide an overview of optimum path routing protocol with cluster interaction. Our proposed scheme is a starting point for some experiments providing perspective over SDN deployment in a cluster environment for IoT. With this aim in mind, we propose a routing protocol that manages routing tasks over Cluster-SDN. By using network virtualization and OpenFlow technologies to generate virtual nodes, we simulate a prototype system controlled by SDN. Our designed testbed, is a real openflow protocol evaluation environment comprising networks and applications, which provide flexible control of framework support for large scale experiments."}]}]}]}}
