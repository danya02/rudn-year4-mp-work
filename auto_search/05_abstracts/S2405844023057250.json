However, whether DNNs have the same capacity for real-world scenes, rather than the simple geometric figures that are often tested, is unclear. In this study, we explore the number perception of scenes using AlexNet and find that numerosity can be represented by the pattern of group activation of the category layer units. The global activation of these units increases with the number of objects in the scene, and the variations in their activation decrease accordingly. By decoding the numerosity from this pattern, we reveal that the embedding coefficient of a scene determines the likelihood of potential objects to contribute to numerical perception. This was demonstrated by the more optimized performance for pictures with relatively high embedding coefficients in both DNNs and humans. This study for the first time shows that a distinct feature in visual environments, revealed by DNNs, can modulate human perception, supported by a group-coding mechanism."}]}]}]}}
