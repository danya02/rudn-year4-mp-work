Various studies show that NMPs occur abundantly within the environment, leading to a high likelihood of human exposure to NMPs. Here, different exposure scenarios can occur. The most notable exposure routes of NMPs into the human body are via the airways and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) through inhalation or ingestion, but also via the skin due to the use of personal care products (PCPs) containing NMPs. Once NMPs have entered the human body, it is possible that they are translocated from the exposed organ to other body compartments. In our review article, we combine the current knowledge on the (1) exposure routes of NMPs to humans with the basic understanding of the potential (2) translocation mechanisms into human tissues and, consequently, their (3) fate within the human body. Regarding the (1) exposure routes, we reviewed the current knowledge on the occurrence of NMPs in food, beverages, personal care products and the air (focusing on indoors and workplaces) and found that the studies suggest an abundant presence of MPs within the exposure scenarios. The overall abundance of MPs in exposure matrices relevant to humans highlights the importance of understanding whether NMPs have the potential for tissue translocation. Therefore, we describe the current knowledge on the potential (2) translocation pathways of NMPs from the skin, GIT and respiratory systems to other body compartments. Here, particular attention was paid to how likely NMPs can translocate from the primary exposed organs to secondary organs due to naturally occurring defence mechanisms against tissue translocation. Based on the current understanding, we conclude that a dermal translocation of NMPs is rather unlikely. In contrast, small MPs and NPs can generally translocate from the GIT and respiratory system to other tissues. Thus, we reviewed the existing literature on the (3) fate of NMPs within the human body. Based on the current knowledge of the contamination of human exposure routes and the potential translocation mechanisms, we critically discuss the size of the detected particles reported in the fate studies. In some cases, the particles detected in human tissue samples exceed the size of a particle to overcome biological barriers allowing particle translocation into tissues. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of critically reading and discussing the presented results of NMP in human tissue samples."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0035", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0030"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0005", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S2452074822000635/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0040", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Description of the three main human exposure pathways to NMP."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Most found particle sizes in tissue samples exceed sizes for tissue translocation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Discrepancy between detected particle sizes and those that can be translocated."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Analytical limitations responsible for discrepancies in particle sizes."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Main future challenges lie in improving QA/QC in exposure and fate studies."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
