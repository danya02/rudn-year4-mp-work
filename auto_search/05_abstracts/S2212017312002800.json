Yet again, energy conservation is another important parameter as mobile nodes are battery constrained. Nodes consume energy not only for transmitting packets but also for reception of unwanted signal from interfering nodes. Therefore it is necessary to minimize the overall energy consumption of mobile nodes by minimizing both transmission cost and reception cost and which results in prolonging the life time of the entire network. In this paper we propose an interference aware minimum energy routing protocol that considers both transmission power and also the reception power of nodes due to interference. The simulation result shows that the proposed method is more energy saving and load balanced than interference unaware routing protocols."}]}]}]}}
