Criminal profiling consists of determining the traits of an unknown offender based on those of the crime and the victims, with a view to their identification. To provide the most likely profile of the perpetrator of a multi-victim homicide, we propose a predictive model of supervised machine learning based on a Bayesian Network. Conventional classifiers can generate the perpetrator\u2019s profile according to the traits of each of the victims of the same homicide, but the profiles may differ from one another.
