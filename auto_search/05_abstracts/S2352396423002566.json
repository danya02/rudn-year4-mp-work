Pelvic radiotherapy may produce chronic and debilitating bowel symptoms, yet the underlying pathophysiology is still undefined. Most notably, although pelvic radiotherapy causes an acute intestinal inflammation there is no consensus on whether the late-phase pathophysiology contains an inflammatory component or not. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the potential presence of a chronic inflammation in mucosal biopsies from irradiated pelvic cancer survivors."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Methods"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "We biopsied 24 cancer survivors two to 20 years after pelvic radiotherapy, and four non-irradiated controls.
