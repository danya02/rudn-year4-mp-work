Posttranslational modifications of OTUB1 affect both its DUB activity and its noncanonical activity of binding to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme UBC13, but further investigation is needed to characterize the full inventory of modifications to OTUB1. Here, we demonstrate that SET7, a lysine monomethylase, directly interacts with OTUB1 to catalyze OTUB1 methylation at lysine 122. This modification does not affect DUB activity of OTUB1 but impairs its noncanonical activity, binding to UBC13. Moreover, we found using cell viability analysis and intracellular reactive oxygen species assay that SET7-mediated methylation of OTUB1 relieves its suppressive role on ferroptosis. Notably, the methylation-mimic mutant of OTUB1 not only loses the ability to bind to UBC13 but also relieves its suppressive role on Tert-Butyl hydroperoxide\u2013induced cell death and Cystine starvation/Erastin\u2013induced cellular reactive oxygen species. Collectively, our data identify a novel modification of OTUB1 that is critical for inhibiting its noncanonical activity."}]}]}]}}
