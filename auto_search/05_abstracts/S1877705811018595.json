Two end nodes transmit their signals to multiple relays simultaneously, and the single relay which performs the best symbol error rate (SER) performance is selected to process the received superimposed signal and broadcast the network-coded packet to the end nodes. The SER performance of the proposed relay selection scheme is analyzed and full diversity order is derived if all the relays are used. Extensive simulations are performed and the results show that minimized SER relay selection can considerably enhance the performance of PNC two-way relay channels."}]}]}]}}
