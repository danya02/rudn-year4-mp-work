With the IEEE 802.16e\u22122005 mobility amendment, WiMAX promises to address the ever-increasing demand for mobile high speed wireless data in fourth-generation (4G) networks. WiMAX market studies continue to project increased subscriber growth rates and planned carrier trials worldwide. Coupled with these increasing growth rates and higher WiMAX throughput rates, bandwidth intensive video on demand (VoD), Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), and mobile TV services are emerging in the forefront of the mobile arena."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp000120", "view": "all"}, "_": "In this paper, we explore and derive optimum system level WiMAX parameters by quantifying network performance using such video-rich services. The video traffic will sufficiently load and stress the network to exploit the potential bandwidth, delay, and mobility limitations. We use the OPNET Modeler to engineer simulation sequences and explore the impact of channel bandwidth, time division duplex (TDD) frame size, advanced antenna systems support, and retransmission schemes using four objective performance metrics while streaming a feature-length movie to a Mobile WiMAX subscriber. The objective of this paper is to provide greater insight into Mobile WiMAX system performance using emerging, load intensive and delay sensitive media streaming services."}]}]}]}}
