This has made an increase of bandwidth necessary. Our current data networks are unable to support this growth, so better solution is to use optical data networks, in which the bandwidth is over 50Tbps. Data network provides also provides a huge bandwidth but the maximum speed for an end user is only a few Gbps which is speed of their devices. So if we use wavelength division multiplexing, maximum bandwidth utilization will be done because of simultaneous transmission of data. Traffic grooming problem is a NP-hard problem, so we need to use metaheuristics. DEPT and MOVNS have been proved to provide most optimal solutions. But these were implemented earlier on full grooming network. This paper proposes variants of DEPT and MOVNS using sparse grooming network which will provide better results in terms of throughput and propagation delay."}]}]}]}}
