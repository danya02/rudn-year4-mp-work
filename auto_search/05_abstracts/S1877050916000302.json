However minimum QoS needs to be maintained by the network. In this paper a method has been proposed to compute the various network parameters such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), average delay and network throughput for a FiWi network, to ensure minimum QoS. This approach may be proved very useful in computing these parameters comprehensively for any algorithm related with research issues of FiWi network like ONU placement, survivability, energy efficient algorithms etc."}]}]}]}}
