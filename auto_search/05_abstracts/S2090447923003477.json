Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is an effective means to convey information through an asymmetric vehicle ad hoc network, and it can provide high security while also reducing energy usage. A new protocol is known as energy efficiency, the D-LAR (Directed Location Assist) protocol, is used to determine a node's energy efficiency. To determine the sleep and active states of nodes, propose a sleep scheduling technique. It can also provide a more accurate location of a moving vehicle than existing location support protocols. In comparison to other current systems, the simulation results suggest that the proposed D-LAR technique has the advantages of decreasing the collision attack detection delay time and enhancing security."}]}]}]}}
