This problem variant appears, for example, when disjoint aircraft trajectories shall be determined or in bufferless packet routing. We study the border of tractability for feasibility and optimization problems on three graph classes that are frequently used where space and time are discretized simultaneously: the path, the grid, and the mesh. We show that if all commodities have a common release date, feasibility can be decided in polynomial time on paths. For the unbounded mesh and unit-costs, we show how to construct optimal trajectories. In contrast, if commodities have individual release intervals and turns are forbidden, then even feasibility is "}, {"#name": "math", "$": {"xmlns:mml": true, "altimg": "si105.svg", "display": "inline", "id": "d1e917"}, "$$": [{"#name": "mi", "$": {"mathvariant": "script"}, "_": "NP"}]}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-complete for the path.
