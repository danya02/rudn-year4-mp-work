Load balancing is the allocation of the work of a single application to processors at run-time so that the execution time of the application is minimized. In order to achieve this purpose, load balancing algorithms require various network parameters to make decisions for effectively balancing the load. This paper analyses the scope of the application of network tomography to facilitate load balancing algorithms in estimating network parameters (packet loss and delay) to be used in decision making. This paper also exploits the interdependence of packet loss and delay in the context of load balancing. Evaluation results show that network tomography estimates link delays accurately from the knowledge of path delays and packet loss. This information is instrumental to be used to tune the delay dependence module of various load balancing algorithms."}]}]}]}}
