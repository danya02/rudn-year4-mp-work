Since then, various techniques have cropped up to meet the objective of secured data communication using multimedia documents. In this paper, a novel data hiding approach has been designed to exploit the superpixel of the image to identify the nature of the blocks for embedding data using spatial and transform domain techniques such as Cellular Automata (CA) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) respectively. In addition, an Arnold transform is used to provide a blanket of security through a random selection of blocks via sharable keys.
