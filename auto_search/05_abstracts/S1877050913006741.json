The contribution presented in this paper follows three main characteristics: i) Proposing a new time-aware traffic engineering path constraint considering holding time of connections in addition to the availability, ii) Introducing a novel provisioning algorithm considering the proposed path attribute, and iii) Applying a high volume of high- priority dynamic traffic with long duration to the introduced mechanism in a new simulation environment to prove its effectiveness. The proposed mechanism benefits from dynamic service level agreement negotiation between a customer and service providers to buffer and further process the potentially blocked high priority connection requests. The simulation results show reduced blocking probability, increased availability satisfaction rate, decreased resource overbuild, and better resource utilization to preserve the high priority class of traffic compared to other SLA-aware algorithms and protection schemes in shared mesh optical networks."}]}]}]}}
