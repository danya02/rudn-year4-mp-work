While the transformation of science to technology is more commonly observed in hard science disciplines, the application of knowledge from soft science disciplines to technological innovation has received less attention, so is the Library and Information Science (abbreviated as LIS). This study seeks to examine the role of LIS knowledge in bridging the link between science and technology, how the LIS knowledge contributes to patented inventions, and and discover the future trend of scientific and technological innovation in LIS. The study collected LIS papers cited by patents and the citing patents\u2019 data to explore the relationship between LIS papers and their citing patents based on time, impact, and topic. Six hypotheses were developed to analyze the flow of knowledge between science and technology in LIS, providing insight into the characteristics of knowledge flow and transformation of this field into technology. The study found that the amount of LIS scientific knowledge transformed into technology applications has been increasing, and the average \u201cpaper-patent\u201d transformation time lag per year has been getting longer, etc.. Additionally, the topics \u201cKnowledge organization and strategic planning\u201d, \u201cNetwork service and reference consultation,\u201d and \u201cLibrary and public services\u201d in the LIS have the potential to further contribute to the technology field."}]}]}]}}
