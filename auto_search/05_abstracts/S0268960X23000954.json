CLL is the predominant type of leukemia in Western countries, accounting for 25% of cases. Although many patients remain asymptomatic, a subset may exhibit typical lymphoma symptoms, acquired immunodeficiency disorders, or autoimmune complications. Diagnosis involves blood tests showing increased lymphocytes and further examination using peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry to confirm the disease. With the significant advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, numerous models and algorithms have been proposed to support the diagnosis and classification of CLL. In this review, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of recent applications of ML algorithms in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients diagnosed with CLL."}]}]}]}}
