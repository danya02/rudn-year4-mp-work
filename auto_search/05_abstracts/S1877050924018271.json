In response, this study introduces a methodology that integrates dependency syntactic parsing with hierarchical clustering to derive multi-level insights on user-perceived quality. Initially, we employ dependency syntactic parsing and part-of-speech tagging to identify compound noun phrases within comments. These phrases serve as a specialized out-of-vocabulary library pertinent to the new energy vehicle sector, from which a selection of words is chosen as potential evaluation metrics. Subsequently, we utilize Word2Vec to develop word vectors from automotive forum corpora. Leveraging these word vectors and the identified evaluation metrics, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is then applied to establish a comprehensive three-level user-perceived quality indicator system. Experimental validation conducted on forum comment data from BYD\u2019s new energy vehicles confirms the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The user-perceived quality extraction method delineated in this research aids automotive firms in pinpointing areas of user interest, thereby substantially enhancing user loyalty and satisfaction."}]}]}]}}
