This paper addresses the challenges related to coverage range in outdoor monitoring systems utilizing LoRa, where the network performance is affected by the density of gateways (GWs) and end devices (EDs), as well as environmental conditions. To mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption, the proposed spreading factor (SF) and hybrid (data rate|SF) models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters. The orchestration of concurrent data modifications within the network server (NS) is crucial for uninterrupted communication between GWs and EDs, especially in monitoring electric vehicle (EV) stations to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Employing K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms optimizes ED allocation, averts data congestion, and improves the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR). These methods ensure seamless information reception by meticulously allocated EDs across various GW combinations. To estimate the free-space losses (FSL), a log-distance path loss model (log-PL) is used. Exploring various bandwidths (BWs), bidirectional communications, and duty cycles (DCs) helps to prevent saturation, thus prolonging the operational lifespan of EDs. Empirical findings reveal a notable packet rejection rate (PRR) of 0% for the DBSCAN (hybrid model). In contrast, the K-means exhibits a PRR ranging from 5% (hybrid model) to 35.29% (SF model) for the ten GWs combination. Notably, the network saturation is reduced to 10.185% and 9.503%, respectively, highlighting an improvement in the average efficiency of slotted ALOHA (91.1%) and pure ALOHA (90.7%). These enhancements increase the lifespan of EDs to 15,465.27 days."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "alttext0010"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S2773153724000562/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id13"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "This paper addresses the challenges associated with the coverage range of the LoRa-based EV station monitoring system, where the network performance is influenced by the density of GWs and EDs, along with environmental conditions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "SF and hybrid models dynamically adjust the transmission parameters for various combinations of GWs and EDs to mitigate interference, data throughput losses, and high-power consumption."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "K-means and DBSCAN are employed to optimize ED allocation, preventing data congestion and enhancing the SINR."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "To estimate medium losses, a logarithmic path loss model is utilized.
