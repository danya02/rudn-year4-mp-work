As per WHO mandate, post-introduction evaluation (PIE) be conducted within 6 to 12\u00a0months of vaccine introduction to provide an understanding of the operational aspects of the program. For RVV PIE, an innovative approach to developing and deploying a digitized tool was employed. The present study aims to document the processes followed for digitizing the data collection and analysis tools."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st015"}, "_": "Methods"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The development of the RVV-PIE digital tool was undertaken in two phases.
