Our measure of quantity is based on the general notion of semirings. Furthermore, we develop a syntax-directed static analysis for the new language, which captures the properties of name substitution and semiring value retrieval. Such properties allow us to solve quantitative constraints controlling synchronisations in the analysed systems. We provide an example of a cost analysis of communications in a simple adaptive routing algorithm."}]}]}]}]}}
