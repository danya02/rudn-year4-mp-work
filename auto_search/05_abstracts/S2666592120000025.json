Although traditional post-disaster emergency communication equipment, such as emergency communication vehicles, satellite access stations and satellite communication terminals, to a certain extent, can solve communication problems, the firmware of them makes such equipment faced with difficulty in adapting to the complex disaster environment, limited network coverage and poor mobility of such devices. To settle those problems, we have proposed an integrated satellite-ground emergency constructed-network after disaster technology. The nodes of the network specifically including Mesh AP (access point) nodes and satellite portable stations, adopt a portable design which can be easily carried by the Network deployer and deployed to the corresponding location. The actual deployment test results of the multi-site network show that our technical solution can build a stable emergency communication network within 30\u00a0\u200bmin and support multi-user access, on which users can carry out audio and video communication, file transmission and other services."}]}]}]}}
