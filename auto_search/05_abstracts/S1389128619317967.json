Among a massive number of IoT devices, a portion of them require ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) provided via fifth generation (5G) networks, bringing many new challenges due to the stringent service requirements. Albeit a surge of research efforts on URLLC and mIoT, access mechanisms which include both URLLC and massive machine type communications (mMTC) have not yet been investigated in-depth. In this paper, we propose three novel schemes to facilitate priority-based "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "initial access"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " for mIoT/mMTC devices that require URLLC services while also considering the requirements of other mIoT/mMTC devices. Based on a long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) or 5G new radio frame structure, the proposed schemes enable device grouping based on device vicinity or/and their URLLC requirements and allocate dedicated preambles for grouped devices supported by flexible slot allocation for random access. These schemes are able not only to increase the reliability and minimize the delay of URLLC devices but also to improve the performance of all involved mIoT devices. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes through mathematical analysis as well as simulations and compare the results with the performance of both the legacy LTE-A based initial access scheme and a grant-free transmission scheme."}]}]}]}]}}
