Distribution network plays an important role of risk source and vulnerable sector. Therefore, it is necessary to do some research on the reliability assessment for CPDS. The key factors of reliability assessment for the distribution network mainly including network components, cyber medium, network topology are firstly analyzed. Reliability assessment index is then summarized in terms of traditional physical system, common cyber system and the CPDS from extensive literature. This is followed by a review of reliability assessment methods in CPDS, which is mainly categorized into two aspects. Finally, the future research emphases are discussed."}]}]}]}}
