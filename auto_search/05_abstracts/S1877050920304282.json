The authors propose an approach to the construction of such systems using the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology. This will make it possible to create easily scalable low-cost systems with high energy efficiency through the use of modern communication technologies. During the experiment, the authors have identified certain patterns in collected data, such as dependence on the time of year, weather, and the location of certain industrial facilities near the observed zone."}]}]}]}}
