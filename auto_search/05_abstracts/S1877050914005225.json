We performed a series of experiments on various types of data (both real and synthetic) to estimate quality of classification techniques and compare them with other classification algorithms that generate hypotheses, e.g. ID3 and Random Forest. In addition to classification precision and recall we also evaluated the time performance of the proposed methods."}]}]}]}}
