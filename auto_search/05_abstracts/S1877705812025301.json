IRIS and MICAz sensor motes are used to realize the hardware requirements of the WSN and the acquired data were processed. Multi-hop capability of the mesh network is also implemented. A couple of limitations are encountered on the motes such as the limited sampling rate achievable on the mote and the size of the data to be acquired. In order to find out the various limitations of the mote, numerous tests are conducted and stable parameters are used in the final system. A comparison was made between the reconstructed audio and the original audio to highlight the key differences. A low level detection system is proposed. Problems encountered during the course of work are also highlighted and solutions are proposed. With all the required objectives met, the paper has contributed to the development of an acoustic monitoring system."}]}]}]}}
