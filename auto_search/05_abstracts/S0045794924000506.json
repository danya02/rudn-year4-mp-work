The safety of each building depends not only on its structural integrity but also on the interactions with neighbouring structures and their collective performance. The structural assessment of such complex constructions can benefit from BIM methodology. The latter eases modelling complicated solid geometries and assigning mechanical properties information essential for developing a reliable finite element model. Thus far, BIM to finite element analysis procedures applied to historic constructions have remained laborious, semi-automatic, and based on proprietary software. This paper introduces an open-source automated solid finite element analysis method using OpenBIM data (IFC). The tool implemented automatically creates tetrahedron mesh and assigns mechanical properties, self-weights, and fixities at the structure's base. The methodology is applied to an actual masonry building aggregate to validate its capability of working with complex geometries and scalability."}]}]}]}}
