However, there remains a dearth of comprehensive understanding the global perspective and the dynamics of the proteome and phosphoproteome in ICM and DCM, which hinders the profound comprehension of pivotal biological characteristics as well as differences in signal transduction activation mechanisms between these two major types of heart failure. We conducted high-throughput quantification proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of clinical heart tissues with ICM or DCM, which provided us the system-wide molecular insights into pathogenesis of clinical heart failure in both ICM and DCM. Both protein and phosphorylation expression levels exhibit distinct separation between heart failure and normal control heart tissues, highlighting the prominent characteristics of ICM and DCM. By integrating with omics results, Western blots, phosphosite-specific mutation, chemical intervention, and immunofluorescence validation, we found a significant activation of the PRKACA\u2013GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway in ICM. This signaling pathway influenced remolding of the microtubule network and regulated the critical actin filaments in cardiac construction. Additionally, DCM exhibited significantly elevated mitochondria energy supply injury compared to ICM, which induced the ROCK1\u2013vimentin signaling pathway activation and promoted mitophagy. Our study not only delineated the major distinguishing features between ICM and DCM but also revealed the crucial discrepancy in the mechanisms between ICM and DCM. This study facilitates a more profound comprehension of pathophysiologic heterogeneity between ICM and DCM and provides a novel perspective to assist in the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for different types of heart failure."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical Abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S1535947623001780/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id8"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Discovery of different expressed proteins and pathways of heart failure."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of ICM and DCM pathogenesis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Identification of subtype-specific kinases and activated signaling pathways."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "The PRKACA\u2013GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway activated in ICM."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "DCM exhibited the ROCK1\u2013VIM signaling pathway activation and promoted mitophagy."}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0025"}, "_": "In Brief"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "High-throughput quantification proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis identified the system-wide molecular characteristics of ICM and DCM heart failure pathogenesis.
