Designers can find suitable cases by selecting of index tags and the calculation of similarity with the existed cases in database to get related biomimetic keywords from TRIZ innovative principles. Designers can use biomimetic searching method with the keywords to find suitable innovative biomimetic design concepts to match the needs of BoP."}]}]}]}}
