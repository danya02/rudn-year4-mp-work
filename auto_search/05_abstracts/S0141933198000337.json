The networks that support such connectivity must provide high bandwidth, low latency, scalability, low cost, high level of usability, and reliability [1]. A key parameter that influences the network performance characteristics such as maximum latency, throughput, scalability and tree saturation, is the arbitration policy implemented in routers."}]}]}]}}
