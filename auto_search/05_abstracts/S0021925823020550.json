Furthermore, NNMT controls the phenotypic transition from homeostatic, pro-regenerative lipofibroblasts to pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. This effect of NNMT is mediated, in part, by the downregulation of lipogenic transcription factors, TCF21 and PPAR\u03b3, and the induction of a less proliferative but more differentiated myofibroblast phenotype. NNMT confers an apoptosis-resistant phenotype to myofibroblasts that is associated with the downregulation of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bim and PUMA. Together, these studies indicate a critical role for NNMT in the metabolic reprogramming of fibroblasts to a pro-fibrotic and apoptosis-resistant phenotype and support the concept that targeting this enzyme may promote regenerative responses in chronic fibrotic disorders such as IPF."}]}]}]}]}}
