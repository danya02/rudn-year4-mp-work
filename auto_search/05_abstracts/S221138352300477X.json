Abundant Yes-associated protein (YAP), which is a powerful transcription co-activator for proliferative genes, was observed in the nucleus of inflammatory FLSs with unknown upstream mechanisms. Using Gene Expression Omnibus database analysis, it was found that Salvador homolog-1 (SAV1), the pivotal negative regulator of the Hippo-YAP pathway, was slightly downregulated in RA synovium. However, SAV1 protein expression is extremely reduced. Subsequently, it was revealed that SAV1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by interacting with an important serine-threonine kinase, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2), which was predominately upregulated by GPCR activation induced by ligands such as prostaglandin E"}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "2"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " (PGE"}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "2"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") in RA. This process further contributes to the decreased phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional potency of YAP, and leads to aberrant FLSs proliferation. Genetic depletion of GRK2 or inhibition of GRK2 by paroxetine rescued SAV1 expression and restored YAP phosphorylation and finally inhibited RA FLSs proliferation and migration. Similarly, paroxetine treatment effectively reduced the abnormal proliferation of FLSs in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis which was accompanied by a significant improvement in clinical manifestations. Collectively, these results elucidate the significance of GRK2 regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling in FLSs proliferation and migration and the potential application of GRK2 inhibition in the treatment of FLSs-driven joint destruction in RA."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "The interaction of GRK2 promotes the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of SAV1, which enhances YAP nuclear translocation and downstream gene expression, and finally promotes the proliferation and migration of FLSs."}, {"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "alttext0010"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S221138352300477X/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id10"}}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
