Compared to virtual machines, containers are lighter since they do not bundle a (guest) operating system but they share its kernel, and they only include the files, libraries, and dependencies that are required to properly execute a process. In the past few years, multiple container engines (i.e., tools for configuring, executing, and managing containers) have been developed ranging from some that are \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d, and mostly employed for Cloud executions, to others that are built for specific contexts, namely Internet of Things and High-Performance Computing. Given the importance of this technology for many practitioners and researchers, this paper analyzes six state-of-the-art container engines and compares them through a comprehensive study of their characteristics and performance. The results are organized around 0 findings that aim to help the readers understand the differences among the technologies and help them choose the best approach for their needs."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e2667", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "Editor\u2019s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e2673", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e2674"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e2676", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e2677", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e2679"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e2680"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e2683", "view": "all"}, "_": "Different contexts (Cloud, HPC, IoT) demand specialized container engine solutions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e2685"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e2688", "view": "all"}, "_": "Docker offers the richest feature set; others focus on context-specific optimizations."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e2690"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e2693", "view": "all"}, "_": "All container engines support OCI standards, but vary in optimization techniques."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e2695"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e2698", "view": "all"}, "_": "HPC-specific engines excel in performance metrics."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e2700"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e2703", "view": "all"}, "_": "No one-size-fits-all solution for container engines; choice depends on specific needs."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
