Machine learning has been preliminarily applied in lithology identification, logging curve reconstruction, reservoir parameter estimation, and other logging processing and interpretation, exhibiting great potential. Computer vision is effective in picking of seismic first breaks, fault identification, and other seismic processing and interpretation. Deep learning and optimization technology have been applied to reservoir engineering, and realized the real-time optimization of waterflooding development and prediction of oil and gas production. The application of data mining in drilling, completion, and surface facility engineering etc. has resulted in intelligent equipment and integrated software. The potential development directions of artificial intelligence in petroleum exploration and development are intelligent production equipment, automatic processing and interpretation, and professional software platform. The highlights of development will be digital basins, fast intelligent imaging logging tools, intelligent seismic nodal acquisition systems, intelligent rotary-steering drilling, intelligent fracturing technology and equipment, real-time monitoring and control of zonal injection and production."}]}]}]}}
