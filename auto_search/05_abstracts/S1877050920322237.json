An example of the unique demands is the increasing exchange of data in Internet services, which has led to wireless network deployment for data transmissions. The coordination of the IoT devices, smart systems, and agriculture can contribute directly to the development of the farmer\u2019s practices by building their farm more intelligent and digital. However, enhancing farming practices requires inspecting farm equipment and farmer\u2019s experiences, which can be analyzed through the interconnectedness of IoT objects to collect farm data over the Internet to launch smart digital agriculture. It is challenging to control all farming processes (especially in real-time), this remaining as the main limitation of traditional farming. In this work, we focus on how wireless sensors can play a vital role in smart farm systems and allow processing the large amount of data generated in batches or real-time to analyze it, retrieve insights from it, and create a Smart Digital Farm. This paper proposes hierarchical-logic mapping and deployment algorithms to tackle the problem of poor network connectivity and sensing coverage in random IoT deployment."}]}]}]}}
