For this purpose survey instruments such as questionnaires are normally used. They can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, depending on the different needs and on the complexity of analysis. In the present study we have investigated the patterns of behavior related to a business game \u2013 TheGame \u2013 delivered by Allianz to its employees about an episode related to leadership. The answers have been collected and analyzed by using a content enabling system, that provides deep semantic information access and dynamic classification features for large quantities of distributed multimedia data. This innovative analysis highlights how the groups of employees have proceeded in organizing meetings where to share the game strategy, assign individual tasks, complying with individuals\u2019 talents and skills, sharing and grounding the knowledge into the final decisions. The most active people have normally urged those less motivated or helped those in need, letting them feel part of the project. The sharing of information has become the connective tissue for the groups. Each test has been faced with enthusiasm and the team spirit has always prevailed to individuality. For many, the game has created, reinforced or enhanced the team spirit in the company."}]}]}]}}
