Subjects pressed a left- or right-hand key labeled \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to indicate whether a monaural tone had just been presented to the ear specified by a left or right probe light. Subjects were faster in indicating that the probed ear had been stimulated than in indicating that it had not been stimulated. Subjects also responded faster, when the location of the response key and probe light corresponded than when they did not. The methodological implications of the latter finding for research on hemispheric dominance were discussed. Finally, there was no evidence that retrieval time varied as a function of either the ear probed or the ear stimulated."}]}]}]}}
