There are many sources of pollution, and identifying these sources, the different polluting substances, and their effects on ecosystems is complex. They can arise from natural disasters or as a result of human activity. The need to preserve the environment has become a real societal and economic challenge. The preservation of the environment can also be done by better management of human activities. However, these solutions require several human and technological resources, and they are expensive. However, such applications are usually deployed in large areas, not accessible and without pre-existing infrastructure, or that would require substantial redevelopment costs) In addition, they have to work for months (or even years) without human intervention. Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used to implement such applications. In this context, we introduce not only the notion of IoT but also Edge/Cloud Computing for environmental monitoring. The proposed solution represents a solution that is both financially and energy-efficient. This paper also focuses on accessing issues to IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) sensors using Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)."}]}]}]}}
