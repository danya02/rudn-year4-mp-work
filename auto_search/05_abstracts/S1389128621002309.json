For this purpose, a node that is constantly in scan mode, called friend node (FN), stores these messages, sending them on request. This mechanism works with a stop-and-wait protocol, resulting in inefficient channel utilisation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no proposals for the improvement of this mechanism, likely due to its novelty."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1069"}, "_": "This paper studies different approaches for the improvement of the friendship mechanism: improving the Bearer Layer, improving time synchronisation and improving advertising channel utilisation. The results of this study reveal that each of the proposals presents a limitation that makes its final implementation unfeasible, and thus the challenge arises of developing a proposal for its optimisation. Accordingly, this work presents a proposal to improve the friendship mechanism with Burst Transmissions and Listen Before Transmit (BTLBT), which has been evaluated and validated in real hardware platforms. The results obtained for 4 LPNs show a reduction in the time required to receive the FN messages, as well as a 66.65% reduction in the time required to scan for each message. Finally, a consumption study is presented, where the results show that our proposal achieves a 19.81% improvement in lifetime compared to the standard friendship mechanism."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1071"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1072"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1074"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1075"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "href": "pii:S1389128621002309/fx1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "id": "d1e1079"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1080"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1081"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1083"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1084"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1086"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1087"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1090"}, "_": "Bluetooth mesh provides the friendship mechanism for battery operated devices."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1092"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1095"}, "_": "Different approaches for the improvement of the friendship mechanism are studied."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1097"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1100"}, "_": "Our final proposals improve the Bluetooth mesh friendship mechanism."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1102"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1105"}, "_": "Experiments reveal a reduction in the scanning time required per message of up to 66.65%."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1107"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1110"}, "_": "Our proposal also achieves a 19.81% increase in Low Power Node lifetime."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
