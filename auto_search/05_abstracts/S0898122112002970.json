Critical IOT technologies consist of a wireless sensor network, RFID, various sensors and an embedded system. For multi-sensor data fusion computing systems, data aggregation is a main concern and can be formulated as a multiple dimensional based on particle swarm optimization approaches. The proposed improved PSO method can locate the minimizing solution to the objective cost function in multiple dimensional assignment themes, which are considered in particle swarm initiation, cross rules and mutation rules. The optimum seclusion can be searched for efficiently with respect to reducing the search range through validated candidate measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved PSO method for multi-sensor data fusion is highly feasible for IOT system applications."}]}]}]}}
