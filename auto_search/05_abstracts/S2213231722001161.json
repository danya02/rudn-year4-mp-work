It is accompanied by a high rate of lung metastasis, and high mortality. Recent studies have suggested the important roles of tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family proteins in regulating various substrates and signaling pathways in different tumors. However, the detailed functional role of TRIM family proteins in the progression of OS is still unknown and requires further investigations. In this study, we found that tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22) was downregulated in OS tissues and was hence associated with better prognosis. "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "In vitro"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vivo"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " functional analysis demonstrated that TRIM22 inhibits proliferation and metastasis of OS cells. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a redox regulator, was identified as a novel target for TRIM22. TRIM22 interacts with and accelerates the degradation of NRF2 by inducing its ubiquitination dependent on its E3 ligase activity but independent of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Further, a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that knockdown or overexpression of NRF2 reversed the functions of knockdown or overexpression of TRIM22 in OS. Mechanistically, TRIM22 inhibited OS progression through NRF2-mediated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance. ROS production was significantly promoted and mitochondrial potential was remarkably inhibited when overexpressing TRIM22, thus activating AMPK/mTOR signaling. Moreover, TRIM22 was also found to inhibit Warburg effect in OS cells. Autophagy activation was found in OS cells which were overexpressed TRIM22, thus leading to autophagic cell death. Treatment with N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) abolished the decreased malignant phenotypes in TRIM22 overexpressing OS cells. In conclusion, our study indicated that TRIM22 inhibits OS progression by promoting proteasomal degradation of NRF2 independent of KEAP1, thereby activating ROS/AMPK/mTOR/Autophagy signaling that leads to autophagic cell death in OS. Therefore, our findings indicated that targeting TRIM22/NRF2 could be a promising therapeutic target for treating OS."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "alttext0010"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S2213231722001161/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id10"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "TRIM22 inhibits proliferation and metastasis of OS cells."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "TRIM22 interacts with and accelerates NRF2 degradation by inducing its ubiquitination dependent on E3 ligase activity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "TRIM22 inhibited OS progression through NRF2-mediated intracellular ROS imbalance."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "TRIM22 inhibits OS progression by promoting NRF2 degradation, thereby activating ROS/AMPK/mTOR/Autophagy signaling."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
