Such networks combine an infrastructure part that relies on fixed equipments with intermittently or partially connected parts formed by mobile devices. This model has been implemented in a middleware platform called Nephila. Simulation results confirm that, with Nephila, thousands of people roaming a medium-size city center can share multimedia con- tents, using a combination of stable and transient transmission links."}]}]}]}}
