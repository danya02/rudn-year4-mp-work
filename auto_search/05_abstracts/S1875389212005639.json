In this paper, we propose a signcryption based light weight key exchange protocol named SLWKE which can provide resistance to traditional attacks, i.e., eavesdropping, deducing, replaying, interleaving, forging and repudiating, and unknown key-share attack and save computational cost by three modular calculations, i.e., one modular inversion, one modular addition and one modular multiplicative, included in a signature s and communicational overhead by secure length of IqI in comparison to signcryption based direct key exchange using a time-stamp protocol termed Dkeuts."}]}]}]}}
