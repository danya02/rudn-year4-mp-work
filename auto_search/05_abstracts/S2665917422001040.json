Half of the world population depends on agriculture and agriculture based products. Growth of the agriculture is mainly affected by the intruders. Detecting intruders in agriculture is a challenging task. Effective intruder detection module requires performance analysis and improvisation. Agriculture intrusion detection model starts with the selection of the suitable topology. Internet of Things (IoT) module mainly relies on the data transmission and reception from sensors which are logically arranged in the farm field. Agriculture Intrusion Detection System can be used with wireless sensors in order to detect the intruders in the agriculture field and sends an alert message to the user which exchange information among internet connected devices based on the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Main objective is to identify the suitable topology for the transmission of Data from various sensor nodes. Nodes are placed in the field at various topologies like star topology, Bus topology, P2P Topology, Mesh Topology. Performance of the various topologies is measured and compared by analysing metrics like Bandwidth, Latency, Throughput, Noise Ratio, Power Factor and Packet Loss. Result shows that the Mesh topology outperforms other topologies."}]}]}]}}
