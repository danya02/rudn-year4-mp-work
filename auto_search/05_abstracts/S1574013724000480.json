Text classification, a vital aspect of text mining, provides robust solutions by enabling efficient categorization and organization of text data. These techniques allow individuals, researchers, and businesses to derive meaningful patterns and insights from large volumes of text. This survey paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy specifically designed for text classification based on research fields. The taxonomy is structured into hierarchical levels: research field-based category, research field-based sub-category, methodology-based technique, methodology sub-technique, and research field applications. We employ a dual evaluation approach: empirical and experimental. Empirically, we assess text classification techniques across four critical criteria. Experimentally, we compare and rank the methodology sub-techniques within the same methodology technique and within the same overall research field sub-category. This structured taxonomy, coupled with thorough evaluations, provides a detailed and nuanced understanding of text classification algorithms and their applications, empowering researchers to make informed decisions based on precise, field-specific insights."}]}]}]}}
