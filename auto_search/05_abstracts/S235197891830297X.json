The methods for conceptualization are applied mainly in knowledge engineering and data mining areas. The key element in formal conceptualization applications is the concept set construction phase. The main goal of the research work is to analyse the different incremental methods and to optimize their efficiency. The proposed method is based on the novel combination of the Ferre and InClose methods providing an efficient update operation. Based on the performed comparison tests, the proposed method outperforms the main incremental methods and for some parameter ranges, its efficiency is comparable with the efficiency of the best batch methods."}]}]}]}}
