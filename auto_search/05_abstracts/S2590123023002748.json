In order to achieve efficient data flow and sharing and co-governance. Based on the MTP-Argon2 hash function algorithm in the Itsuku PoW technical solution, we add computing power optimization and correction multi-objective optimization operations, and use the network control right separation technology of the FS-Open Security SDN model to establish local database access policies and storage credentials. The traditional hardware devices are separated from the centralized network architecture of the smart energy network into a hybrid network architecture model of distributed trust. The results show that the distributed trust hybrid network architecture model achieves low latency and circumvents network bandwidth limitations, reflecting the energy efficiency gain and security stability of the model, as well as network load robustness."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "We extend our theoretical understanding of the centralized network architecture of the smart energy network."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "We propose a model to realize the efficient flow and sharing and co-governance of network data."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "We evaluated the performance of the control scheme based on Itsuku PoW block access algorithm."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "We achieved low latency of the distributed trust hybrid network architecture model."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
