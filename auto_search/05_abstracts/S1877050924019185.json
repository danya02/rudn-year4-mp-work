These models not only understand language but also function as intelligent agents, engaging with investors through open-ended conversations and influencing their decision-making. Utilizing unstructured data from a professional Danish real estate website, we developed a real estate AI agent in both English and Danish using LangChain and Pinecone. Through testing and evaluation, our agent has demonstrated superior professional and concise outputs compared to other LLMs like Doubao and ChatGPT 4 and shown excellent performance and effectiveness. Our work serves as a reference for AI in real estate investment-related research and proposes new solutions to the \"unprofessional foundation \" and \" expensive consulting fee\" problems encountered by ordinary investors in their investment decisions."}]}]}]}}
