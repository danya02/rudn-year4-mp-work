As a result, it will be possible to connect smart physical goods and enable smart decision-making across a wide range of applications. Various devices, including computers, actuators, and sensors, may link to one another and exchange data in a networked environment known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart refers to how humans communicate with technology, whereas \u201dsmart objects\u201d describes the machines themselves. As the market's supply of gadgets grows, ensuring their safety becomes more critical than ever. The availability of cutting-edge methods and tools has been instrumental in the current surge of interest in IoT security studies. To guarantee success, these applications need the characteristics of the environment provided by the IoT framework. This essay dives deep into the IoT's layered architecture, layer-by-layer protocols, cutting-edge use cases, and pervasive security concerns. In addition to analysing the current security structure, this paper provides a research taxonomy for IoT. Our study is more comprehensive than many that have come before it on the topic of the Internet of Things; we look at everything from sensors to real-world applications."}]}]}]}}
