This work focuses on optimizing the gateway placement problem in WMNs taking into account objectives like minimizing the number of gateways, reducing hop count, and minimizing the path delay. We employ Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) to simultaneously optimize these objectives and find an optimal gateway placement. The results demonstrate its superiority over traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in finding better solutions with conflicting objectives. The work provides a practical and effective approach to optimizing broadband access, network design, and gateway placement in WMNs, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technology."}]}]}]}}
