It was developed by the DEXPI+ working group and builds upon the DEXPI (Data Exchange in the Process Industry) standard for piping and instrumentation diagrams. Digitalization is making increasing demands on the exchange of information in the process facility lifecycle. Industry 4.0 methods require shared terminology and knowledge models to exchange information. Standards, such as ISO15926, CFIHOS and DEXPI, try to address this need. All these focus on the physical plant items, as shown on a PID or 3D model. There is a lack of standards for early-phase, top-down process design. DEXPI Process fills this gap. This paper presents the development of DEXPI Process in the context of knowledge modelling of process systems and previews how the model is a foundation for applications of automated reasoning and decision support for design and operations."}]}]}]}}
