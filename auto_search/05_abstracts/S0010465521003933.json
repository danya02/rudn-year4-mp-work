The framework components naturally implement tools to address the challenges in these kinds of experiments. The integration of a detector physics response, the implementation of signal processing routines, or topological algorithms for physical event identification are some examples. Despite this specialization, the framework was conceived thinking in scalability. Other event-oriented applications could benefit from the data processing routines and/or metadata description implemented in REST, being the generic framework tools completely decoupled from dedicated libraries."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0170", "view": "all"}, "_": "REST-for-Physics is a consolidated piece of software already serving the needs of different physics experiments - using gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) as detection technology - for detector data analysis and characterization, as well as generic R&D. Even though REST has been exploited mainly with gaseous TPCs, the code could be easily applied or adapted to other detector technologies. We present in this work an overview of REST-for-Physics, providing a broad perspective to the infrastructure and organization of the project as a whole. The framework and its different components will be described in the text."}]}]}]}}
