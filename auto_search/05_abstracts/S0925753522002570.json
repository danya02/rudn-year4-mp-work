In the absence of objective failure data, risk estimates are generated in facilitated workshops that rely on the judgement of diverse technical opinion from subject matter experts. These estimates generate the performance targets for the engineering controls referred to in the Hierarchy of Controls embedded in work health and safety regulations. This novel study investigated biases within the context of facilitating risk assessment workshops which can lead to understatement of risk estimates. Such biases can be dangerous and potentially difficult to prevent or mitigate.
