This algorithm can be used to analyze the borrowing behavior of users in the library. This article introduces the principle and process of the Apriori algorithm, and then performs data preprocessing and cleaning on the library borrowing records. Frequent itemsets and association rules are mined by using Apriori algorithm, and the results are explained and analyzed. The research results of this paper show that there is a certain correlation between the books borrowed by library users. According to the mining results of association rules, the library can recommend different books for different types of users, so as to improve user satisfaction and borrowing rate."}]}]}]}}
