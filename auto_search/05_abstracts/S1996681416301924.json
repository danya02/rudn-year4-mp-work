Now the service lives of sensors are limited mainly because of their battery power storage. So the life cycle of the whole network can be extended if the service life of each sensor in the network is prolonged. In this paper, the Strip Clustering Scheme (SCS) is proposed to replace the Conventional Scheme (CS). This method includes region division, cluster head node selection, link construction, data fusion and transmission. Adopting SCS can reduce a lot of redundant data and the total energy consumption of the network by data fusion. In addition, adopting SCS can also extend the monitoring area without increasing the communication range of the Access Point (AP), and facilitate further expansion of the network as a result. Based on the numerically simulated results, CS method can be used for the WSN within 75"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "m, and SCS method is more suitable when the monitoring range is larger than 75"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "m.
