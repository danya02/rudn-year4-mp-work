However, retrieving accurate fashion images is challenging due to the low inter-class separability. In this paper, we aim to propose and implement three deep learning denoising autoencoder image retrieval models trained on Fashion-MNIST dataset and MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is widely used datasets to evaluate model because of its low inter-class separability. It is difficult to get a good accuracy on Fashion-MNIST dataset. The proposed models train to learn significant features of fashion images and improve the precision of image retrieval. These models are compared based on the Label Ranking Average Precision (LRAP) values, with the third model bagging the highest LRAP value. These models also trained and tested on MNIST dataset, which have similar configuration as Fashion-MNIST dataset but with high inter-class separability. Intriguingly, the second and third models trained on MNIST dataset demonstrate neck-to-neck performance, both achieving comparable accuracy. This choice of dataset ensures that the models\u2019 accuracy is more noticeable and significant. The outcomes of this study validate the efficacy of denoising autoencoders in fashion image retrieval and emphasize their prospective in improving online shopping experiences."}]}]}]}}
