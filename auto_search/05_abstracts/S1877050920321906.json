Currently, such activities are an integral part of the functioning of enterprises, and their connection with traditionally understood entrepreneurship has contributed to the broader implementation of the concept of sustainable entrepreneurship. Under this concept, enterprises pursue various goals that include three groups: economic, ecological and social goals, with the last two groups being the subject of the study of this article. The article aims to present the results of the survey, their analysis and interpretation. The study focused on searching for similarities between enterprises and identifying on this basis specific characteristic behavioral patterns. Due to a large number of objects and features in the data set, we used Orange Data Mining. An approach to the analysis of survey data using the clustering method and visualization in the form of tables and charts were proposed\u2014the analysis aimed at isolating the characteristic attitudes of enterprises in the implementation of social and environmental goals. The obtained results indicate the directions for improving their strategies in implementing the assumptions of the concept of sustainable entrepreneurship."}]}]}]}}
