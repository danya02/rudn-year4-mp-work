This study observed the profile elements of student that contribute to the failures rate of student. There are several factors which are affecting the student behavior such as: relative bond, education schedule, nonattendance, school level of father and mother, period of Voyage and etc. The research that presented in this paper mainly focus on monitoring elements that potential to ruin students performance. Based on the collected data, it will calculate the gap between each factors to measure the flow betwenness and role-influence analysis of students who has high family quality time, free time and gout time tends to High value on efficiency, emergent leader and in the know of influence network. This mean student who has flow great betwenness value among the other will control the flow of network and this person will encourage other member in network and can be act as a leader. It is found that goouttime and freetime as well as study time has strong correlation with catastrophe of study where student that has high flow betwenness tend to spread their influence toward other student. Teacher and School management should aware to this kind of student and take action properly. The result of study is important for learning improvement in the future, whether system or person improvement, so it can drive to better education in the future."}]}]}]}}
