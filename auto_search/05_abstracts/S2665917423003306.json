Other newly created techniques, including Big Data, Cloud Services, and surveillance, can participate through these technological advances. In this study, the researchers look at the four systems mentioned above to identify their shared functions and integrate them to create useful potential applications. Despite the limitations of the smart city concept, researchers would seek innovative methods to collect and process sensor information within an IoT-enabled smart building. A cloud service would have been used as the foundation technology for the proposed schema management platform, collecting the information generated by each sensor in the smart factory. It was easy to manage and manipulate remotely using IoT technology and a mobile device with a network connection. Here, to enhance safety of the entire building by installing multiple IoT devices in a smart building. The proposed systems were designed in a simulated Cooja simulator environment. The proposed approaches to the collection and manipulation of sensor information in smart cities can help us create a green, resource-efficient project."}]}]}]}}
