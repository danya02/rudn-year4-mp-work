Despite the vast improvements in HVAC and lighting systems, plug loads remain an under-studied area for enhancing building energy efficiency. This paper studies smart plug active operating mode detection, plug-level load forecasting, and plug scheduling methodologies. This research leverages a unique dataset from the University of California, San Diego, consisting of readings from over 150 smart plugs in several office buildings for more than a year, notably during the post-Covid era. This dataset is made publicly available.
