During route discovery, generally multiple paths are discovered to each of the multicast destinations. Among them only one is elected depending upon its lifetime or weight. Priority is assigned to the paths that will survive upto completion of the present session of packet transfer from given source to destination node. If more than one path is expected to remain alive till the multicast session is over or none of the available path options have chance to live (at least mathematically) till end of the multicast session, weight is assigned to the paths by the destination. The path with highest weight is elected as optimal. Weight is computed based on residual energy and multicast packet transmission capability of nodes in a path along with number of multicast destinations residing in that path. If more than one path has same weight then the one suffering less delay is given priority. Simulation section in this article demonstrates that WEEM produces more packet delivery ratio and alive node ratio, at much less control message cost, than other competing multicast protocols."}]}]}]}}
