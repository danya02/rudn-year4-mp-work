It expedites automated theorem proving, speeds up the analysis and retrieval of mathematical knowledge from documents, and improves e-learning and educational platforms. It also simplifies translation, scientific research, data analysis, interpretation, and the practical application of mathematical information. Mathematical entity recognition in the Bangla language is novel; to our best knowledge, no other similar works have been done. Here, we identify the mathematical operator, operands as numbers, and popular mathematical terms (complex numbers, real numbers, prime numbers, etc.). In this work, we recognize Bangla Mathematical Entity Recognition (MER) utilizing the ensemble architecture of deep neural networks known as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We prepare a novel dataset comprising 13,717 observations, each containing a mathematical statement, mathematical entity, and mathematical type. In our recognition process, we consider our proposed architectures using accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score as the performance metrics. The results have shown a satisfactory accuracy percentage of 97.98 with BERT and 99.76% with ensemble BERT."}]}]}]}}
