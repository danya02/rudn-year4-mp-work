This algorithm focuses the localization area of nodes in WSN by using the anchor nodes communicating directly and two-hop with unknown nodes. The advantage of this algorithm is that no additional hardware is needed, and the localization accuracy of classic range-free localization is improved obviously. From the simulation of this algorithm, we get the expected results."}]}]}]}}
