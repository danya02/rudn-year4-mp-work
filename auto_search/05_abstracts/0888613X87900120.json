To ensure system adaptability and to allow controlled experimentation, CODER has been designed as a distributed expert system. The use of individually tailored specialist experts, coupled with standardized blackboard modules for communication and control and external knowledge bases for maintenance of factual world knowledge, allows for quick prototyping, incremental development, and flexibility under change. The system as a whole is being implemented under UNIX as a set of MU-Prolog and C modules communicating through pipes and TCP/IP sockets."}]}]}]}}
