Data polled from the sensors is represented visually in an immersive environment which is a facsimilie of the school campus. Students\u2019 intuitions about geography and other disciplinary domains are \u2013 by definition \u2013 tacit, yet they are critical in shaping understanding of broader disciplinary concepts. Through surfacing such intuitions in ways which are authentic to the students, the former become boundary objects which can subsequently be dialogued about with peers and teachers."}]}]}]}}
