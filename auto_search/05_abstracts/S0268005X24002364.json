Cryo-transmission electron microscopy revealed a slight decrease in interfacial thickness, measuring 2.8\u00a0nm for pea protein alone, compared to 2.3\u00a0nm at the highest phosphatidylcholine-to-pea protein ratio (PC/sPPI) of 0.8 (w/w), and a slight decrease in interfacial roughness, albeit that the differences are small."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The oxidative stability of the emulsions globally increased with increasing the PC/sPPI ratio, with the exception of the system with a PC/sPPI ratio of 0.6, which was more sensitive to oxidation than all the other PC-containing emulsions. This peculiar behavior is discussed in the context of model interfacial films of comparable mixed compositions, which exhibit discrete spherical structures and strands. Our results suggest that the PC/sPPI ratio determines the specific interfacial structure that is formed (i.e., packing and patchiness), and it can be expected that thereby the oxidative stability of O/W emulsions stabilized by proteins and phospholipids is modulated."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "alttext0010"}, "_": "Image 1"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "href": "pii:S0268005X24002364/ga1", "id": "aep-link-id10"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0030", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "For all emulsifier ratios, the emulsions were stable to coalescence."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC)-containing emulsions resisted flocculation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Interfacial heterogeneity decreased with increasing PC/pea protein (PP) ratio."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "At high PC/PP ratio, PC became dominant at the oil-water interface."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "This ratio non-monotonically affects oxidative stability and interfacial structure."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
