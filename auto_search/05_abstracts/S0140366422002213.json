Distributed and automated solutions will be essential for this context. This article identifies the main challenges in 5G/6G orchestration and then describes the utility of Artificial Intelligence-driven solutions, outlining an orchestrator architecture for 5G networks. The architecture is then explored as an orchestration solution for two ongoing research projects focused on the deployment of critical services over 5G networks."}]}]}]}}
