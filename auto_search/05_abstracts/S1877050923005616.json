Clustering in the WSN is an efficient method to increase the lifespan of the network. In the proposed work the main concentration is given to the network lifetime which is very necessary for the less node failures and high packet deliveries. In this paper the hierarchical structuring is done using clustering approach based on efficient data aggregation process. The aggregation process is defined into two phases. The first phase defines the arrangement of the nodes in the cluster using uniform distribution and second phase defines the selection of the cluster head and aggregation of the data using linear programming. The main objective is to minimize the energy consumption and increase of the robustness of the sensor network. Eventually the performance of the network will be evaluated in terms of low energy consumption, high packet deliveries and low congestions in the WSN."}]}]}]}}
