Instead of running the NLP modules on the fly for individual search requests, the NLP modules are applied to the text in advance and the results are indexed in a way that enables flexible and efficient integration of them. The query language is based on a variant of the region algebra, in which we can specify a sub- structure in the annotated text that may involve different kinds of annotations. Given a query, the retrieval engine searches for the sub-structure by aggregating the different kinds of annotations through a search algorithm for the extended region algebra. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework through experiments with TREC Genomics Track data."}]}]}]}}
