This paper addresses three issues related to this question. (1) What distinctions of user motivations are identified by previous research, and in what ways are the motivations of users amenable to quantitative analysis? (2) To what extent does tagging motivation vary across different social tagging systems? (3) How does variability in user motivation influence resulting tags and folksonomies? In this paper, we present measures to detect whether a tagger is primarily motivated by categorizing or describing resources, and apply these measures to datasets from seven different tagging systems. Our results show that (a) users\u2019 motivation for tagging varies not only across, but also within tagging systems, and that (b) tag agreement among users who are motivated by "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "categorizing resources"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " is significantly lower than among users who are motivated by "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "describing resources"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ".
