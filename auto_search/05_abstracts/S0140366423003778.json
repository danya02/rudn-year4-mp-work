Tactile Internet applications include the remote control of drones, cars or industrial tele-operation. In this context, the Multi-connection Tactile Internet Protocol (MTIP) is a novel multipath transport protocol designed to support the requirements of Tactile Internet applications in large, private mobile networks. The objective of this paper is to analyze and verify the correctness and performance of the MTIP protocol to ensure that the protocol functions correctly under different network scenarios and it is ready to meet the performance requirements of Tactile Internet applications. For that purpose, a two-step approach is employed to analyze and verify MTIP. In the first step, a formal model of MTIP is developed using timed automata and the "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " tool is utilized to verify correctness properties represented as temporal formulas. In the second step, the performance of the protocol is analyzed using the statistical model checking features of "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "smc"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") in scenarios that are difficult and expensive to reproduce in a real network. The results indicate that MTIP\u2019s model meets the specified temporal properties, and the performance evaluation showcases the potential and trade-off of using multiple paths to enhance the communication. Based on the analysis and verification results, the paper emphasizes the readiness of MTIP for real-world deployment and highlights its potential benefits for enhancing the performance of Tactile Internet applications."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e548", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e549"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e551", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e552", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e554"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e555"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e558", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "Modeling the MTIP protocol with "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e563"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e566", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "Formal verification of the correctness of MTIP with "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e571"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e574", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "Using "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "uppaal"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " Statistical Model Checking ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "smc"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") to analyze the performance of MTIP."}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
