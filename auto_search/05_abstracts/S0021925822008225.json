However, the proteins that interact with mTORC2 to control its activity and localization remain poorly defined. To identify mTORC2-interacting proteins in living cells, we tagged endogenous RICTOR, an essential mTORC2 subunit, with the modified BirA biotin ligase BioID2 and performed live-cell proximity labeling. We identified 215 RICTOR-proximal proteins, including proteins with known mTORC2 pathway interactions, and 135 proteins (63%) not previously linked to mTORC2 signaling, including nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Our imaging and cell fractionation experiments suggest nearly 30% of RICTOR is in the nucleus, hinting at potential nuclear functions. We also identified 29 interactors containing RICTOR-dependent, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites, thus providing insight into mTORC2-dependent insulin signaling dynamics. Finally, we identify the endogenous ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) GTPase as an mTORC2-interacting protein. Through gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we provide functional evidence that ARF1 may negatively regulate mTORC2. In summary, we present a new method of studying endogenous mTORC2, a resource of RICTOR/mTORC2 protein interactions in living cells, and a potential mechanism of mTORC2 regulation by the ARF1 GTPase."}]}]}]}}
