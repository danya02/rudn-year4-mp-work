Moreover, as methods for extracting information from unstructured data become ever more powerful, the desire to integrate the output of such extraction processes with \u201cclean\u201d, structured data grows. We are convinced that for successful integration into databases, such extracted information in the form of \u201ctriples\u201d needs to be both (1) of high quality and (2) have the necessary generality to link up with varying forms of structured data.
