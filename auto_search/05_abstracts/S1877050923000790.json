However, significant risks are encountered in the data security procedures of cloud systems. Although the area is frequently being analyzed and reformed, the concern of cloud data protection and user reliability remains under uncertainty due to growing cyber-attack schemes as well as cloud storage system errors. To deal with this risk and contribute to the endeavor of providing optimal data security solutions in cloud data storage and retrieval system, this paper proposes a Symmetric Searchable Encryption influenced Machine Learning based cloud data encryption and retrieval model. The proposed model enhances data security and employs an effective keyword ranking approach by using an Artificial Neural Network. The comparative assessment of the proposed model against multiclass SVM and Na\u00efve Bayes has established the better operational potentiality of the model. The effectiveness of the proposed work is justified by the association between high TPR and low FPR. Further, a low CCR of 0.6973 adds up to the success of the proposed work."}]}]}]}}
