With such a rich collection available and such a great diversity of users and their various needs, content-based image retrieval becomes a problem. Luckily, this is partially solved by publicly available image search engines; however, a question what their linguistic quality is arises. An approach to evaluate linguistic query based quality of image search engines is proposed in this paper and a sample test set and queries are presented."}]}]}]}}
