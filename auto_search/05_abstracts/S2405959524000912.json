While most APM tools target servers and networking infrastructure, here we focus on APM for devices with strict resource constraints: extremely limited in terms of power, memory and bandwidth. We tailor this article to be both a survey and a tutorial. In the survey part, we investigate APM approaches for low-power wireless networks, with a particular focus on Time Synchronized Channel Hopping solutions, as they are well-suited for critical industrial applications. We survey performance metrics characterizing the network health condition and show how, to capture the health of a network universally, it is important to constantly monitor hardware-related, network-related and network-wide metrics. We present a collection of metrics that serves as a checklist for the design of an APM system, describe related work on APM concepts suitable for low-power wireless system, and provide core concepts for collecting, exporting and processing performance metrics. The tutorial part consists of a hands-on example of running commercial APM and networking solutions. We use the active APM framework from "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Memfault"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", which periodically creates heartbeats including the performance metrics. We run this framework on top of the SmartMesh\u00a0IP protocol stack, a commercial product by Analog Devices that offers wired-like high reliability and a decade of battery lifetime, and integrate it with the "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Zephyr"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " operating systems.
