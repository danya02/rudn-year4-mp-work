However, the ambiguity in the map-matching and route identification processing of link-based probe data analysis has been a difficult problem especially in urban areas with many high-density roads and elevated roads. Unlike situations in which navigation systems are to be developed, in offline analysis, there are cases where a real-time constraint is not imposed. This means we can refer to data from any time of day of a vehicle tour and use much more computer resources than would be available for real-time embedded systems. In this paper, a new method of map-matching and the route identification based on dynamic programming is proposed and its effectiveness is shown in comprehensive field data tests."}]}]}]}}
