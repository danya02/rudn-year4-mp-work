Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, is a key tumor suppression mechanism. Although methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A) has been reported to inhibit several tumor cells, it is unclear whether inhibition of MAT2A in OS cells can reduce ferroptosis. CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate cell viability, cell apoptosis/cycle, and cell migration, respectively. The levels of ferrous iron and glutathione (GSH) levels in cells were measured to evaluate the degree of cell ferroptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein levels of MAT2A, p-STAT3 (Ser727)/STAT3, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in OS cells. MAT2A was significantly upregulated in OS specimens and high MAT2A expression was associated with a poorer prognosis in OS patients. shRNA targeting MAT2A significantly increased OS cell apoptosis, triggered cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase, and attenuated migration ability "}, {"#name": "italic", "$$": [{"#name": "__text__", "_": "in"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "vitro"}]}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ".

Taken together, our study displayed that miR-26b-5p/MAT2A triggers ferroptosis in OS cells by increasing intracellular ferrous iron levels and inhibiting the STAT3/SLC7A11 axis. Our results reveal a MAT2A-mediated ferroptosis defense mechanism used by OS cells and propose a potential ferroptosis-inducing strategy for the treatment of OS patients."}]}]}]}]}}
