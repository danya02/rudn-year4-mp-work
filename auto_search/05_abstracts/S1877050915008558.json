Fur- thermore, we are interested in identification of a limited number of bottleneck links, so we naturally introduce compressed sensing technique into it. Allowing two kinds of paths such as (fully) loopy path and folded path, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm for constructing reflective paths for a given network. In the performance evaluation by computer simulation, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed reflective network tomography scheme."}]}]}]}]}}
