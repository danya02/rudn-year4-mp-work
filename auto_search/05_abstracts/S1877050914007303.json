The performance of EASB is enhanced significantly by consulting a routing table populated in advance, instead of route calculation for each connection request. The table is \u201clooked up\u201d to determine the route that has the minimum hybrid cost for the given source-destination pair of the connection request. As a result a node with lower compute capability can be used to server the equal amount of connection requests while maintaining emission and resource efficiency."}]}]}]}}
