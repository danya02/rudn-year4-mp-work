The present-day cable installation system drives the cables through by power assistance in order to reduce physical stress on the workers. However, the system cannot pull a long and heavy cable sequentially at the desired timing of the tension triggered onto the cable head by the worker. To solve this problem, we propose a multihop wireless controlled system that works to push the cable at a time set by instruction packets delivered according to the applied tension. This paper explains the design and adoption of a multihop wireless controlled sensor and actuator network into the cable installation system."}]}]}]}}
