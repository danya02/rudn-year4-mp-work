The previous work presented a dynamic service level agreement negotiation mechanism considering intra- and inter-domain communications over shared mesh optical networks which may cause heavy control overheads in a dynamic environment such as the control plane of GMPLS-based networks. In this paper, two main issues regarding the dynamic propagation of information will be analyzed: i) control overhead, and ii) propagation delay. The paper employs some alternative means of communication to reduce the overheads and resolve the possible scalability issues."}]}]}]}}
