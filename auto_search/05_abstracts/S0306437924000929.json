Accordingly, analyzing the causes of waiting times in activity transitions can help analysts identify opportunities for reducing the cycle time of a process. This paper proposes a process mining approach to decompose observed waiting times in each activity transition into multiple direct causes and to analyze the impact of each identified cause on the process cycle time efficiency. The approach is implemented as a software tool called Kronos that process analysts can use to upload event logs and obtain analysis results of waiting time causes. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated using synthetic event logs to verify its ability to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in a real-life process. Interviews with process mining experts confirm that Kronos is useful and easy to use for identifying improvement opportunities related to waiting times."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1214", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1215"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1217", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1218", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1220"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1221"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1224", "view": "all"}, "_": "A process mining approach to discover the causes of waiting time from event logs."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1226"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1229", "view": "all"}, "_": "The approach decomposes waiting time in each activity transition into direct causes."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1231"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1234", "view": "all"}, "_": "5 causes considered: batching, prioritization, contention, unavailability, extraneous."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1236"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1239", "view": "all"}, "_": "The approach is embodied in a software tool."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1241"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1244", "view": "all"}, "_": "The approach helps analysts identify improvement opportunities to reduce waiting time."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
