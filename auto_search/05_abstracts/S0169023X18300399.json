This paper presents a Hybrid Semantic Knowledgebase-Machine Learning approach for mining opinions at the domain feature level and classifying the overall opinion on a multi-point scale. The proposed approach benefits from the advantages of deploying a novel Semantic Knowledgebase approach to analyse a collection of reviews at the domain feature level and produce\u00a0a set of structured information that associates the expressed opinions with specific domain features. The information in the knowledgebase is further supplemented with domain-relevant facts sourced from public Semantic datasets, and the enriched semantically-tagged information is then used to infer valuable semantic information about the domain as well as the expressed opinions on the domain features by summarising the overall opinions about the domain across multiple reviews, and by averaging the overall opinions about other cinematic features. The retrieved semantic information represents a valuable resource for modelling a machine learning classifier to predict the numerical rating of each review. Experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed Hybrid Semantic Knowledgebase-Machine Learning approach improved the precision and recall of the extracted domain features, and hence proved suitable for producing an\u00a0enriched\u00a0dataset of semantic features that resulted in higher classification accuracy."}]}]}]}}
