Electrified transportation demands that a wide variety of charging networks be set up, in a user-friendly environment, to encourage adoption. Wireless electric vehicle charging systems (WEVCS) can be a potential alternative technology to charge the electric vehicles (EVs) without any plug-in problems. This paper outlines the current available wireless power transfer technology for EVs. In addition, it also includes wireless transformer structures with a variety of ferrite shapes, which have been researched. WEVCS are associated with health and safety issues, which have been discussed with the current development in international standards. Two major applications, static and dynamic WEVCS, are explained, and up-to-date progress with features from research laboratories, universities, and industries are recorded. Moreover, future upcoming concepts-based WEVCS, such as \u201cvehicle-to-grid (V2G)\u201d and \u201cin-wheel\u201d wireless charging systems (WCS) are reviewed and examined, with qualitative comparisons with other existing technology."}]}]}]}}
