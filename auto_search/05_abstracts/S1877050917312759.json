This naming method enables the user equipments (UEs) to reach IoT devices easily. Nowadays, one of the main challenges in IoT is the discovery scheme. This paper explores the discovery scheme that can operate under the current DNS and its legacy Resource Record (RR) format.

This paper explores how the UE behind the Network Address Translation (NAT) device discovers the destination IoT devices and establishes IoT Device-to-User Equipment (D2U) data session under the condition that IoT access networks tend to be constraint networks. Here, the discovery and session establishment processes are controlled by the software-defined control plane controller."}]}]}]}]}}
