This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach for a prompt and effective triage of software updates, leveraging an evaluation of six release note classifiers to categorize updates by component type, release type, and security risk. Our methodology, tested on a dataset of 1,000 release notes commonly encountered in Industry 4.0 ecosystems, demonstrates Logistic Regression as the most accurate classifier. The findings not only highlight the practical applicability of our approach in real-world data but also set the foundation for future enhancements to streamline the machine learning triage process further."}]}]}]}}
