By observing, it is found that the AJAX contents, which could not be seen by traditional crawler, are well-structured and belong to one specific domain generally. Extracting the structured data from AJAX contents and annotating its semantic are very significant for further applications. In this paper, a structured AJAX data extraction method for agricultural domain based on agricultural ontology was proposed. Firstly, Crawljax, an open AJAX crawling tool, was overridden to explore and retrieve the AJAX contents; secondly, the retrieved contents were partitioned into items and then classified by combining with agricultural ontology. HTML tags and punctuations were used to segment the retrieved contents into entity items. Finally, the entity items were clustered and the semantic annotation was assigned to clustering results according to agricultural ontology. By experimental evaluation, the proposed approach was proved effectively in resource exploring, entity extraction, and semantic annotation."}]}]}]}}
