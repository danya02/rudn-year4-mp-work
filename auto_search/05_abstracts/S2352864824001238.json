Its aim is to provide low-latency and high-performance services for massive access devices. However, the performance of current 6G network intelligence technologies and its level of integration with the architecture, along with the system-level requirements for the number of access devices and limitations on energy consumption, have impeded further improvements in the 6G smart F-RAN. To better analyze the root causes of the network problems and promote the practical development of the network, this study used structured methods such as segmentation to conduct a review of the topic. The research results reveal that there are still many problems in the current 6G smart F-RAN. Future research directions and difficulties are also discussed."}]}]}]}}
