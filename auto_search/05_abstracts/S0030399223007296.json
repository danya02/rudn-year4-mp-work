The proposed design outperforms earlier designs, which have substantial drawbacks such as a bulky metamaterial structure, reduced absorption frequency ranges, and a lower absorption band fraction. High absorption coefficients and Polarization-insensitive behaviour across a large angle range are prominent features of the proposed four-band absorber structure. The EH performance of the designed 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 array structure was measured by an experimental setup conducted in an anechoic chamber. The results demonstrate a notably efficient electromagnetic EH, with resistive loads accounting for up to 96.89% of the total incident energy. The proposed design can potentially be used to develop wireless sensor network applications requiring efficient and compact harvesting systems."}]}]}]}]}}
