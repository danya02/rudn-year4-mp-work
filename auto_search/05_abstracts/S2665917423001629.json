For the enormous IP-based detection technologies in the future IoT, 6LoWPAN mobile compatibility is still in its infancy. A significant 6LoWPAN use of IoT, the hospital's wireless technology, which continuously monitors patients' vital signs, regardless of whether they are moving. To track accurate patient positions, communication between patient nodes and the hospital network needs to be maintained through sensor network. In addition, it must offer automatic switching and improve the power consumption of devices. In this research, a hospital structure based on 6LoWPAN with a Media Access Control (MAC) design for patient data was offered. Our preliminary numerical results indicate a decrease in the expenses associated with transfers on the mobile router, which generally represents a bottleneck in such a network. Biological ECG signals are routed via low pan before transmission via routing algorithms to the gateway network."}]}]}]}}
