Use has been made of Markov model in order to predict the wavelength congestion. A routing algorithm is developed based on the Markov modeling. The results are compared with existing routing algorithms \u2013 Available Shortest Path (ASP) and Online Traffic Grooming Algorithm (OTGA). Validation results have shown that the performance of the proposed system is significantly improved in terms of bandwidth blocking ratio, network utilization as well as port saving due to wavebanding."}]}]}]}}
