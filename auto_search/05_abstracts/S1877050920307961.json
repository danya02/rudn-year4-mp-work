Considering these scenarios, it is essential to secure the computer systems and the user using an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The performance of IDS studied by developing an IDS dataset, consisting of network traffic features to learn the attack patterns. Intrusion detection is a classification problem, wherein various Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) techniques applied to classify the network data into normal and attack traffic. Moreover, the types of network attacks changed over the years, and therefore, there is a need to update the datasets used for evaluating IDS. This paper list the different IDS datasets used for the evaluation of IDS model. The paper presents an overview of the ML and DM techniques used for IDS along with the discussion on CIC-IDS-2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS-2018. These are recent datasets consisting of network attack features and include new attacks categories. This paper discusses the recent advancement in the IDS datasets that can be used by various research communities as the manifesto for using the new IDS datasets for developing efficient and effective ML and DM based IDS."}]}]}]}}
