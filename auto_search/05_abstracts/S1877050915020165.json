Information sharing among vehicles can be considered as one of the most popular medium for exchanging safety and entertainment messages between mobile users. Recently data sharing has also started receiving increased attention from researchers. This paper proposes a Distributed Hash Table based File Sharing Scheme for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks using multipath routing protocol. The scheme guarantees multi-path forwarding due to its underlying property of reactiveness and its application of proactive routing protocol. The packets are transferred to distant nodes with assistance of created Distributed Hash Tables which store information about identities of sender's as well as receiver nodes. By using Multi-path Dynamic Address Routing the algorithm utilizes the best available path until it fails to switch to the next best available route in the network. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves realistic performance of file delivery and also has comparative performance with the existing protocols."}]}]}]}}
