Then, actuators provide users with information services and environmental controls which are suited for time, place, occasion, and people. Although a single service cannot meet diverse requirements of di_erent situations, it is hard to deploy and configure a variety of devices for each of envisioned services. To solve the problem, we propose a mechanism to dynamically self-organize service networks by combining existing devices. In our proposal, we adopt a mathematical model of division of labors in a colony of social insects to accomplish autonomous selection of devices, which o_er sensing and control functions to a service network, while taking into account their states and service requirements. Through simulation, we confirmed that our proposal can organize e_cient service networks combining nodes with higher residual energy and more service provision."}]}]}]}}
