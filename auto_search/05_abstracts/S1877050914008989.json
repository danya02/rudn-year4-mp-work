We target on the design challenge when the wireless link quality is dynamic due to the the environmental factors or user mobility. We develop a Dynamic and Agile buffor-control scheme, called DAB, that adaptively adjust the video buffer size based on the measurements of the signal strength (RSSI) and accelerometer on the smartphone. Our goal is to keep a smooth playback while delivery as little data as possible to the end-user in order to save bandwidth cost. We have implemented our solution on Android platform and evaluate it with experiments. Compared to the traditional video buffer scheme, our solution DAB significantly improves the performance in terms of the quality of playback and the buffer efficency."}]}]}]}}
