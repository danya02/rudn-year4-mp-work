This prevents them from taking appropriate corrective actions in a timely manner. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-stage computational procedure for grouping and visualizing correlated alarms, such that root-cause abnormalities can be more easily identified by the human operators. In the first stage, using a word embedding-based approach, alarm tags are transformed into real-valued vectors, where time stamps of the alarms are used rather than their order of occurrence. In the second stage, a multi-level density-based clustering approach is utilized to group correlated alarms hierarchically. In the third stage, a hierarchical visualization approach is developed to display alarm groups to human operators, which depicts hierarchical and statistical information. The implementation and effectiveness of the three-stage computational procedure are demonstrated using an alarm dataset generated for the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process system."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1660", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1661"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1663", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1664", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1666"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1667"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1670", "view": "all"}, "_": "By identifying correlated alarms, operators can focus on alarms related to root-cause abnormalities."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1672"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1675", "view": "all"}, "_": "A three-stage computational procedure is delivered, to group correlated alarms."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1677"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1680", "view": "all"}, "_": "A time-augmented word embedding method is presented, which increases accuracy."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1682"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1685", "view": "all"}, "_": "A density-based clustering method is proposed, which reduces computational complexity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1687"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1690", "view": "all"}, "_": "A hierarchical visualization method is developed, which depicts correlated alarms."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
