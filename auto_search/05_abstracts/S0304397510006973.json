Moreover, even if each node maintains a stable connection with each of its neighbors for some period of time, it is impossible to solve the geocast problem if nodes move too fast. Additionally, we give a tradeoff lower bound which shows that the faster the nodes can move on a monodimensional space, the more costly it would be to solve the geocast problem. We provide geocasting algorithms for the case where nodes move in one dimension and also when they can move on the plane (i.e., in two dimensions). We prove correctness of our algorithms by giving exact bounds on the speed of movement. Our analysis helps understand the impact of speed of nodes, firstly, on geocasting solvability and, secondly, on the cost of geocasting."}]}]}]}]}}
