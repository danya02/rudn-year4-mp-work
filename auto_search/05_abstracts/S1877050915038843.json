Diversity of Web users causes multiple problems for local and international companies, which want to provide their services using the World Wide Web. Two models are widely applied for cross-cultural website design: culture marker model and culture dimension model. One of the main culture marker model's markers is colour. Application of colour has an impact on usability of cross-cultural websites. However there is poor availability of solutions for designers for extraction and analysis of colour information from websites. An algorithm and set of tools that allows to extract and collect colour information from source code and rendered image of websites is proposed."}]}]}]}}
