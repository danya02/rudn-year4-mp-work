It assists and improves work performance both in the field of industry and our daily life. Wireless Sensor Network has been widely used in many areas especially for surveillance and monitoring in agriculture and habitat monitoring. Environment monitoring has become an important field of control and protection, providing real-time system and control communication with the physical world. An intelligent and smart Wireless Sensor Network system can gather and process a large amount of data from the beginning of the monitoring and manage air quality, the conditions of traffic, to weather situations. In this paper, we discuss and review wireless sensor network applications for environmental monitoring. In order to implement a good monitoring system, there are several requirements to be followed. From the studies, it has been proved to be an alternative way to replace the conventional method that uses men force to monitor the environment. It is also proven that these approaches can improve the system performance, provide a convenient and efficient method and can also fulfill functional requirements."}]}]}]}}
