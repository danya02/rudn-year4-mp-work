In the deep learning regime, recent works have suffered from large label set and heavy imbalance distribution. To mitigate the negative effect in such scenarios, we propose a retrieve and rerank framework that introduces the Contrastive Learning (CL) for label retrieval, allowing the model to make more accurate prediction from a simplified label space. Given the appealing discriminative power of CL, we adopt it as the training strategy to replace the standard cross-entropy objective and retrieve a small subset by taking the distance between clinical notes and ICD codes into account. After properly training, the retriever could implicitly capture the code co-occurrence, which makes up for the deficiency of cross-entropy assigning each label independently of the others. Further, we evolve a powerful model via a Transformer variant for refining and reranking the candidate set, which can extract semantically meaningful features from long clinical sequences. Applying our method on well-known models, experiments show that our framework provides more accurate results guaranteed by preselecting a small subset of candidates before fine-level reranking. Relying on the framework, our proposed model achieves 0.590 and 0.990 in terms of Micro-F1 and Micro-AUC on benchmark MIMIC-III."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e897", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e898"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e900", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e901", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e905", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S153204642300117X/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
