In order to obtain the real-time ice-coating data of the transmission lines in ice disaster accurately, this paper designs a real-time monitoring system applied in transmission lines based on ZigBee technology and mesh topology architectures. This system takes advantage of low power consumption of ZigBee technology, self-organization and self-healing of mesh network, and uses the F-AODVjr(F-Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing) to establish a ZigBee wireless communication mesh network. A simulating demonstration is given in the end with the discussing of the system's feasibility and practicability."}]}]}]}}
