This article aims to uncover opportunities associated with the implementation of emerging systems empowered by AI for KM. In doing so, we explicate the potential role of AI in supporting fundamental dimensions of KM: creation, storage and retrieval, sharing, and application of knowledge. We then propose practical ways to build the partnership between humans and AI in supporting organizational KM activities and provide several implications for the development and management of AI systems based on the components of people, infrastructures, and processes."}]}]}]}}
