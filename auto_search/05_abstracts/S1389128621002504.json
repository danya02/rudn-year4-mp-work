The nodes of the WASN are Raspberry Pi devices that not only record the ambient sound, but also detect and recognize different sound events. All the signal processing tasks, from the recording to the classification carried out by a convolutional neural network (CNN), are run on Raspberry Pi devices. Due to the low cost of the proposed acoustic nodes, the system exhibits a very high potential scalability. Regarding the underlying WASN, it has been designed according to the open standard FIWARE, thus the whole system can be deployed without the need of proprietary software. Regarding the performance of the sound classifier, the proposed WASN achieves similar accuracy compared to other WASNs that make use of cloud computing. However, the proposed WASN significantly minimizes the network traffic since it does not exchange audio signals, but only contextual information in form of labels. On the other hand, most of the time the class reported by the WASN nodes is the \u201cbackground\u201d soundscape, which usually contains no event of interest. This is the case when monitoring the soundscape of big avenues, where four events have been identified: \u201ctraffic\u201d, \u201csiren\u201d, \u201chorn\u201d and \u201cnoisy vehicles\u201d, being the \u201ctraffic\u201d class associated to the background soundscape. In this paper, the use of a simple pre-detection stage prior to the CNN classification is proposed, with the aim of saving computation and power consumption at the nodes. The pre-detection stage is able to differentiate the other three relevant sounds from the \u201ctraffic\u201d and activates the classifier only when some of these three events is likely occurring. The proposed pre-detection stage has been validated through data recorded in the city of Valencia (Spain), achieving a reduction of the Raspberry Pi CPU\u2019s usage by a factor of six."}]}]}]}}
