Although progress has been made in data lake research and applications, there are also numerous issues and challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we survey some recent developments, provide our observations, as well as our expectations on future research and practice in this area. We start with a discussion on general terminology in data lakes, then review various aspects of data lakes, including an examination on metadata and related issues, information granularities involved in data lakes, unique features such as mixed lazy and eager approach in data lake lifecycle, relationship between data lakes and data mining, interplay between data lakes and data warehousing techniques, as well as some notable developments related to applications of data lakes. We present our observations while we examine these aspects, and wrap up this paper by expressing our hope of developing a unified framework for data lake lifecycle evaluation."}]}]}]}}
