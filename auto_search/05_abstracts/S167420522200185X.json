Transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to various environmental stimuli by modulating the expression of numerous stress-responsive genes. However, how the crosstalk between different transcription factor families orchestrates initiation of the key transcriptional network\u00a0and the role of posttranscriptional modification of transcription factors, especially in cellular localization/trafficking in response to stress in rice, remain still largely unknown.

Further studies revealed that OsMYBR57 interacts with a homeodomain transcription factor, OsHB22, which also plays a positive role in drought signaling. We further demonstrate that OsFTIP6 interacts with OsHB22 and promotes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsHB22 into the nucleus, where OsHB22 cooperates with OsMYBR57 to regulate the expression of drought-responsive genes. Our findings have revealed a mechanistic framework underlying\u00a0the OsFTIP6-OsHB22-OsMYBR57 module-mediated regulation of drought response in rice.
