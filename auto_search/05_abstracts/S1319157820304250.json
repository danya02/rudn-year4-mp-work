For example, computers can understand more of the document context, and indexing and clustering in information retrieval can be done precisely with less or no ambiguity of words. However, there are only a few annotated corpora in Malay language, which are not publicly shared. In this paper, we delve into analysing and annotating Malay translated hadith documents in terms of tagging and entities. There are three phases, which are manual filtering and cleaning, analysing the corpus and creating the benchmark. As the result, an analysis and benchmark of Malay translated hadith corpus were produced in term of part-of-speech and named entities tags that follows the Zipf\u2019s law distribution."}]}]}]}}
