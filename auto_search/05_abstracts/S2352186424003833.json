However, their industrial feasibility is hampered by long startup times. In this paper, we demonstrated that SMFCs could be rapidly initiated by employing precultured anodes. The performance of precultured anodes in reducing startup times was strongly influenced by the duration of culture time. High-throughput sequencing techniques and community level physiological profiling (CLPP) methods were utilized to study the structural and functional diversity of the bacterial communities on incubated anodes. Results revealed that the collaborative role of organic matter degrading biofilms and electroactive biofilms on the anodes in expediting startup. Network interactions analysis further showed more compact co-occurrence patterns, less topological roles of individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and dominant modules were obtained after SMFCs setup. This was primarily due to the formation of more stable and higher microbial carbon metabolism functions anode biofilms.
