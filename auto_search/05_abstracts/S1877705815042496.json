This paper proposes a new approach of automatic retrieval of IDM concepts from patents. It mainly consists of using generic linguistic markers to locate and extract IDM related knowledge, such as problems, partial solutions and parameters, to automatically populate IDM Ontology. Lastly, a comparison is made between respective results of manual and automatic retrieval to assess the current accuracy of our approach."}]}]}]}}
