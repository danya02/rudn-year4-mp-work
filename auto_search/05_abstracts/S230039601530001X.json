Evacuation and rescue plans allow to each underground mine to respond and establish control in case of emergency. The primary goal of this paper is to determine the optimal system for evacuation in case of fire in underground mines and through a process of computer simulation to be presented to all workers that are affected by this issue. In this study is developed a system that allows by using available software\u00a0to work out the complete evacuation plans that include analysis of fire scenarios and optimal routes for evacuation. With development of database of fire scenarios, it is possible to plan routes for evacuation in all situations. This presented methodology can serve to make effective system for evacuation and rescue in case of fire and to help save lives and protect the financial investment in the mine. This methodology represents the most economical option of making an effective system for evacuation and also can serve as an idea of making a software package that includes all the steps of making a system for evacuation and rescue in case of fire in underground mines. This presented model will have increased accuracy compared to other models presented so far, because of the prepared 3D model of the underground mine which includes the actual dimensions of the mine along with its associated elements from which the fire dynamics and system for evacuation depends."}]}]}]}}
