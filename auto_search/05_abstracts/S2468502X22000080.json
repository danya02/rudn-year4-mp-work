Knowing in advance the data, the aggregation functions that are used for visualization, the visual encoding, and available interactive operations for data selection, LVI allows to avoid time-consuming data retrieval and processing of raw data in response to user\u2019s interactions. Instead, LVI directly predicts aggregates of interest for the user\u2019s data selection. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in application to two use cases of spatio-temporal data at different scales."}]}]}]}}
