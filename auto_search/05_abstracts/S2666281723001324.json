These tools typically match images and videos to known CSAM databases, which is an ineffective method for identifying unknown CSAM. To identify potential complimentary methods, we analysed 162 unique known images, displayed 7289 times on 988 Dark Web websites, to determine if patterns in file/folder naming and structuring tendencies existed on websites. Overall, websites prioritised organisation (ease of access) over obfuscation (security) and hosted almost all images they displayed. File/folder names were commonly alphanumeric, however, there was evidence of sequence file naming patterns. Webpages displaying CSAM were explicitly named, often using underage and/or incest-related keywords. Structuring patterns revealed presence of website copies (mirrors) which can impede effective CSAM removal. Recommendations for supplementing automated detection techniques are discussed."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Patterns in website structuring can complement existing CSAM detection methods."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Disseminators of CSAM on the Dark Web prioritize organisation over obfuscation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Webpages displaying CSAM are often easy to find and explicitly named."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "File name sequencing and presence of mirrored websites impact CSAM detection."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
