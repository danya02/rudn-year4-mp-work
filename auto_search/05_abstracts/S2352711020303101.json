In order to optimize and automate the process of subsurface characterization and structural modeling we developed a modular, open-source software system called GeoReVi (Geological Reservoir Virtualization). The tool implements the knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process and utilizes techniques from visual analytics for interactive, interdisciplinary, database-bound knowledge discovery and communication. Multidimensional data sets \u2013 produced in subsurface and outcrop analog studies \u2013 can be imported, shared, transformed, projected, analyzed, modeled, grouped and visualized interactively in a custom-made graphical user interface. The underlying data model facilitates domain experts to efficiently work in multi-user environments. The knowledge discovery potential is illustrated with an exemplary case study."}]}]}]}}
