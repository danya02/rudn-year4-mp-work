To minimize their effects, integrated pest management (IPM) strategies are needed. However, the adopted IPM strategies involve human operators who manually monitor and evaluate insect pests and their effects, respectively. The manual methods involved are tedious, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. To avoid the drawbacks, monitoring processes can be made automatic, which involves the detection of the flies without human operator intervention. To achieve automatic detection and monitoring, insect traps are equipped with electronic sensors (i.e., optical, acoustic, or image) for accurate and efficient monitoring. The traps are further linked together over a communication network, allowing the pests to be monitored remotely without requiring frequent field visits, which leads to smart traps. In this work, we summarize automatic techniques that are used to monitor pests in fruit production (such as mangoes, apples, and olives)."}]}]}]}}
