Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, are typically divided into two use-cases: task-oriented bots and social friend-bots. Task-oriented bots are often used to do activities such as answering questions or solving basic queries. Furthermore, social-friend-bots are designed to communicate like humans, where the user can speak freely and the bot answers organically while maintaining the conversation\u2019s ambience. This paper analyses recent works in the conversational AI domain examining the exclusive methodologies, existing frameworks or tools, evaluation metrics, and available datasets for building robust conversational agents. Finally, a mind-map encompassing all the stated elements and qualities of chatbots is created."}]}]}]}}
