Wireless devices link to one another directly in an ad hoc network without the use of a central Wireless Access Point (WAP). Data transit between wireless devices is frequently managed and directed by a base station or WAP device. As soon as two or more devices converse with one another, an ad hoc network is instantaneously created. Although placing these devices close to one another is preferred, the network's quality and speed will decline as more devices join it. The idea of a vehicular ad hoc network, an intelligent vehicular ad hoc network, and a mobile ad hoc network is also introduced in ad hoc networks since nodes travel from one point to another. Any node can join and exit this network at any time. Nodes are mobile systems or gadgets that are a part of the network, like a mobile phone, laptop, personal digital assistant, MP3 player, or personal computer. Apart from this, the paper also discusses the most important results from 2000 to 2022 from various authors. In addition, the paper contrasts mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks in terms of their uses, limitations, issues, characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages of routing protocols. The most important things for ad hoc networks are that the different types of nodes (end-to-end nodes, intermediate nodes, and wireless antennas) are safe and respond quickly."}]}]}]}}
