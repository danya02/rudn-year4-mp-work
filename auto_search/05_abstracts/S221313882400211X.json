In this work, several control strategies are compared for the optimal design of a high-temperature, power-constrained electrified district heating network of a university campus with borehole thermal energy storage and grid services such as flexibility, load-levelling and wind curtailment mitigation. The proposed heat plant operation is modelled in TRNSYS and its performance is analysed from a grid operator and end-user\u2019s viewpoint. The impact of several system parameters is investigated in a sensitivity analysis."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e3302", "view": "all"}, "_": "It is shown that, depending on the control strategy, total efficiencies up to 200 % and curtailed wind fractions up to 43.8 % are achievable with great flexibility and load-levelling, and operating costs and emissions significantly lower than for gas-reliant systems. A control strategy which aims for load-levelling and maximal storage headroom is shown to be best suited from the perspective of both the end-user (efficiency, emissions and cost) and grid operator (grid services). A compromise between efficiency and grid services is highlighted which could be mitigated by financial incentives for curtailed wind integration, benefiting both consumers and grid operators."}]}]}]}}
