In the proposed method, a new angle orientation histogram has been introduced named as Angle Edge Histogram. By applying Pythagorean theory to image, very useful characteristics have been obtained for image matching, search and retrieval. Proposed method has also been compared with existing methods and the results show that it outperforms the existing methods in values of precision and recall and balance of precision and recall. Proposed method receives an average of 94% of precision and 79% of recall rates."}]}]}]}}
