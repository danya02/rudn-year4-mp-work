Using wireless technology its now possible to broadcast, store and analyse this data in near real time. The athletic environment is considered electrically harsh and for aquatic sports there are considerable challenges for the wireless transmission of athlete data. This paper outlines some of the recent developments in radio based technologies. Power consumption, antenna design, frequency selection, communications protocols, product selection and human comfort, together with some examples are reported. A range of licence free frequencies were investigated in the air/water interface and the antennas characterised."}]}]}]}}
