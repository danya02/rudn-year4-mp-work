Gas network optimization problems typically belong to the class of Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Problems (MINLP). However current state-of-the-art MINLP solvers are not yet mature enough to solve large-scale real-world instances. Therefore, an established approach in practice is to solve the problems with respect to a coarser representation of the network and thereby reducing the size of the underlying model. Two well-known aggregation methods that effectively reduce the network size are parallel and serial pipe merges. However, these methods have only been studied in stationary gas transport problems so far. This paper closes this gap and presents parallel and serial pipe merging methods for transient gas transport problems. An empirical evaluation indicates that the developed methods perform very accurately on a huge set of fine-grained real-world data taken from one of the largest transmission system operators in Europe."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0110", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ls0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "First approaches to pipe merging in transient gas networks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Development of an equivalent parallel pipe merging method."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "Counterexample to equivalent serial pipe merging."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0040"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0040", "view": "all"}, "_": "Development of a sampling based regression approach for serial pipe merging."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0050"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0050", "view": "all"}, "_": "Empirical evaluation on a huge data set of real-world gas network operations."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
