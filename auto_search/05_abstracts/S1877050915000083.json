The shadowing and multipath issues restrict the high performance nature of 4G cells. In Multi hop Relay (MHR) networks, Relay Stations (RS) are introduced to improve coverage and capacity of the system. There exist some issues like path selection and RSs deployment, which severely affects the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system. In this paper, to improve the QoS of MHR networks, Load Aware Routing Metric (LARM) based path selection and a low complex Burst Profile (BP) based RS deployment schemes are discussed."}]}]}]}}
