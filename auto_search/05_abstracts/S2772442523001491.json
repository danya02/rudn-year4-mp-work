They have a broad scope in different applications observed in the dentistry literature review. This study reviews the literature on deep learning and dental radiograph analysis. We present an overview of machine learning algorithms in different areas of dentistry: tooth identification and numbering, Dental disease detection, and dental predictive treatment models. The methods under each area are briefly discussed. The dental radiograph data set required for performing experiments is summarized from the available literature. The study concludes by discussing new research opportunities and initiatives in this field. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of this innovative, challenging, and growing area in dentistry."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1270", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1271"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1273", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1274", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1276"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1277"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1280", "view": "all"}, "_": "Highlight how deep learning techniques have infused dental radiograph analysis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1282"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1285", "view": "all"}, "_": "Discuss different dental radiograph enhancement techniques and available datasets."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1287"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1290", "view": "all"}, "_": "Identify the challenges for applying deep learning in dental radiograph analysis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1292"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1295", "view": "all"}, "_": "Illustrate particular contributions that exploit or eliminate these challenges."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1297"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1300", "view": "all"}, "_": "Showcase the novel opportunities of deep learning in dentistry."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
