Elder people wish to stay as independently as possible and are keen on fulfilling lives, but self-regulating ways of life involve with risks, such as weakening, memory loss or impaired judgment and falling that limit mobility. In particular, the daily home activity involving basic functions like preparing breakfast or food, showering, walking, sleeping, watching television, reading books etc., is a key indicator in determining the performance of elder home activity. A intelligent, robust, less cost, flexible and real time home monitoring system has been developed to record the basic home activities and respond immediately when there is a change in the regular daily activity of the elder person. This paper will report our recent works based on trial work of the system to determine the behaviour of elderly person activity."}]}]}]}}
