In order to address GALS issues and bandwidth requirements, the proposed multi-synchronous bidirectional NoC\u2019s router is developed and it guarantees higher packet consumption rate, better bandwidth utilization with lower packet delivery latency. All the input/output ports of the proposed router behave as a bi-directional ports and communicate through a novel multi-synchronous first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer. The bidirectional port is controlled by a dynamic channel control module which provides a dynamic reconfigurable channel to the router itself and associated sub-modules. This proposed multi-synchronous bidirectional router architecture is synthesized using Xilinx ISE 14.7 and FPGA Virtex 6 family device XC6VLX760 is considered as target technology and its performance is evaluated in terms of power, area and delay."}]}]}]}}
