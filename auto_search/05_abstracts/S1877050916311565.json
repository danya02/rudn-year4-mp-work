It is a fundamental requirement of all the search engines to provide recommendation to identify user preferences. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm to recommend images based on ANOVA Cosine Similarity where text and visual features are integrated to fill the semantic gap. Visual synonyms of each term are computed using ANOVA "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "p"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-value by considering image visual features on text-based search. Expanded queries are generated for user input query and text based search is performed to get initial result set. Pair-wise image cosine similarity is computed for recommendation of images.

Experiments results shows that the ACSIR outperforms iLike method by providing more relevant products to the user input query."}]}]}]}]}}
