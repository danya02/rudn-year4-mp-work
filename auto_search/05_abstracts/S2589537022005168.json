Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared opioids administered via IVPCA or PCEA and reported outcomes of interest were included. Studies were excluded if the solution for patient-controlled analgesia contained antiemetics and/or other analgesics in addition to opioids. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Summary data were extracted from each eligible study. The primary outcome was pain intensity, and the secondary outcomes were opioid-related adverse effects. Frequentist network meta-analyses were performed using a contrast-based random-effects model.
