It is going towards a fully automated industrial environment where all the components including post production, pre production, supply chain and quality control would be automatically managed. Human will work more with brain, where all the physical efforts would be replaced by ML enabled intelligent robots that will perform all the tasks, where sensor networks will collect live information from the environment. All the decision would be taken on the fly from the previous records. In this work, we have tried to shed some light on the current involvement of ML and IoT in industry 4.0 environment. 28 articles were reviewed in this work which were selected through a selection process and were published between 2017 and 2022. Different tools, protocols, algorithms and the latest technologies used in the industry 4.0 environment have been analytically discussed in this work. Research gaps were tried to found out and some recommendations were provided which can be a pathway to research advancement related to industry 4.0."}]}]}]}}
