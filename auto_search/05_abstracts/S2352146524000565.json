One of the major concerns of the corresponding research community is the safety of the AVs. Considering this, a lightweight accident detection model for autonomous fleets is presented, utilizing only GPS data. The proposed accident detection model combines well-known statistical and machine learning techniques such as data normalization, PCA transformation, and DBSCAN clustering. In order to validate the proposed methodology simulated data were utilized exploiting well-established techniques, such as Dead-Reckoning, accident speed profiles, and pre-crash acceleration models. The preliminary results highlighted that the proposed methodology managed to achieve its accurate accident detection purpose presenting accuracy higher than 98%."}]}]}]}}
