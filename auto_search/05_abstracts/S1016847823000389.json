The lamin assembly process requires the A11, A22, and ACN binding modes of the coiled-coil dimers. Although X-ray crystallography and chemical cross-linking analysis of lamin A/C have provided snapshots of A11 and ACN binding modes, the assembly mechanism of the entire filament remains to be explained. Here, we report a crystal structure of a coil 2 fragment, revealing the A22 interaction at the atomic resolution. The structure showed detailed structural features, indicating that two coiled-coil dimers of the coil 2 subdomain are separated and then re-organized into the antiparallel-four-helix bundle. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ACN binding mode between coil 1a and the C-terminal part of coil 2 when the A11 tetramers are arranged by the A22 interactions. We propose a full assembly model of lamin A/C with the curvature around the linkers, reconciling the discrepancy between the "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in situ"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "in vitro"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " observations.
