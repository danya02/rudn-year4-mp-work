Freshwater biofilms play a major role in the removal of organic contaminants from receiving water bodies, but knowledge of the molecular mechanisms driving contaminant biotransformations in complex stream biofilm (periphyton) communities remains limited. Previously, we demonstrated that biofilms in experimental flume systems grown at higher ratios of treated wastewater (WW) to stream water displayed an increased biotransformation potential for a number of organic contaminants.

Here, we conducted deep shotgun sequencing of flume biofilms and identified a positive correlation between WW percentage and metagenomic read abundances of DEET hydrolase (DH) homologs. To test the causality of this association, we constructed a targeted metagenomic library of DH homologs from flume biofilms. We screened our complete metagenomic library for activity with four different substrates, including DEET, and a subset thereof with 183 WW-related organic compounds. The majority of active hydrolases in the metagenomic library preferred aliphatic and aromatic ester substrates while, remarkably, only a single reference enzyme was capable of DEET hydrolysis. Of the 626 total enzyme-substrate combinations tested, approximately 5% were active enzyme-substrate pairs. Metagenomic DH family homologs revealed a broad substrate promiscuity spanning 22 different compounds when summed across all enzymes tested.
