In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2\u00a0min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8\u00a0min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online ("}, {"#name": "inter-ref", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "intref0010", "href": "http://www-users.york.ac.uk/%7Ede656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html", "type": "simple"}, "_": "http://www-users.york.ac.uk/\u223cde656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ").
