It is then used to compile and continually update a geohazard database. The procedure is based on new technologies that publish news on the internet, i.e., the news is analyzed, georeferenced and attributed to a category of geohazards (the current categories are landslides, floods and earthquakes). A\u00a0continuous flow of georeferenced events is established to populate and update the geodatabase automatically and in near-real time. We tested the procedure for 2 years at a national scale, creating a geodatabase containing more than 20,000 news items concerning geohazards that occurred in Italy. This procedure enables continuous feedback from events in the real world, such that information about geohazards can be fully exploited rapidly (compared to traditional techniques based on remote sensing, field surveys and historical inventories)."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "We develop a procedure to automatically geotag internet news."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "A national geohazards inventory is created and updated using Google News service."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Information about geohazards can be fully exploited in extremely short times."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "We examine properties and distribution of the collected geohazard news."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
