The main challenge involved in the adaptation process is building the prior knowledge required for deciding the number of scalable layers. This paper implements Scalable Video streaming over a Software Defined Network. From this work, we derive the prior knowledge required by the controller to identify the adaptation parameters for different network conditions and video types."}]}]}]}}
