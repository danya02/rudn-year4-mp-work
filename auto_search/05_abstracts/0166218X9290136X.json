In this paper, we present a framework for the analysis of routing schemes in distributed memory multiprocessor systems containing faulty or unusable components. We introduce techniques for the derivation of the probabilities of succesfully routing a single message using minimal path routing schemes. Using this framework, we derive closed form solutions for a wide range of routing schemes on the hypercube and on the two- dimensional mesh. The results obtained show the surprising resilience of the hypercube to a potentially large number of faults while demonstrating the inability of the mesh to tolerate a comparatively smaller number of faults."}]}]}]}}
