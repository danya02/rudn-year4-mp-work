Despite the availability of numerous fingerprinting datasets utilizing various wireless signals, the challenge of device heterogeneity and sample density remains an unanswered issue. To address this gap, this work introduces TUJI1, an anonymized IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) fingerprinting dataset collected using 5 different commercial devices in a fine-grained grid. The dataset contains the matched fingerprints of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements with the corresponding coordinates, split into training and testing subsets for effortless and fair reproducibility."}]}]}]}}
