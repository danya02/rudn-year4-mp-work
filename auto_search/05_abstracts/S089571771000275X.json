A p-cycle and p-path dynamic hybrid protection strategy based on block probability is developed. Some valuable and significant results are achieved by comparing this dynamic hybrid protection strategy with a pure p-cycle protection scheme as regards redundancy of network resource. By this strategy the protected links and the pre-configured time of the p-cycle and p-path can be determined according to the block probability which can indicate the network behaviors, so the requirement of real-time pre-configuring can be met. It is shown by simulation that the optimal proportion p-cycle and p-path dynamic hybrid protection strategy has higher resource utilization ratio and lower resource redundancy than the pure p-cycle protection strategy in the case of 35% block probability threshold and smaller than 400 pre-configured structure number."}]}]}]}}
