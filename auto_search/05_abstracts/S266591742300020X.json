Nonetheless, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have a tendency to change their network topology frequently because of the mobility of vehicles. Since there will be many handovers, network performance will be negatively affected. A new architecture called Software Defined Network (SDN) can be used to make the vehicular network more efficient by making network devices that connect to each other programmable. This research proposes a seamless handover system in which the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Media-Independent-Handover (MIH) Framework are used to implement dynamic topology changes in VANETs. VANET as well as Internet of Things (IoT) plays a good role on the handover scheme. IoT gives a better results in the traffic management, security and connectivity. In order to demonstrate the dominance of our proposed model, network simulations are carried out from a variety of angles and perspectives. The results reveal that when a handover occurs, our solution can greatly enhance network performance. The performance can be evaluated in the form handover delay, handover failure ratio, throughput and packet loss with 5%, 40%, 10% and 2% improved with the existing methods."}]}]}]}}
