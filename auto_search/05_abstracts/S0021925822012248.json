We recently reported a brain-specific alternative splicing of exon 4 in "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "TMEM63B"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ". The short variant lacking exon 4, which constitutes the major isoform in the brain, exhibits enhanced responses to hypoosmotic stimulation compared to the long isoform containing exon 4. However, the mechanisms affecting this differential response are unclear. Here, we showed that the short isoform exhibited stronger cell surface expression compared to the long variant. Using mutagenesis screening of the coding sequence of exon 4, we identified an RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (RER). We found that this motif was responsible for binding to the COPI retrieval vesicles, such that the longer TMEM63B isoforms were more likely to be retrotranslocated to the ER than the short isoforms. In addition, we demonstrated long TMEM63Bs could form heterodimers with short isoforms and reduce their surface expression. Taken together, our findings revealed an ER retention signal in the alternative splicing domain of TMEM63B that regulates the surface expression of TMEM63B protein and channel function."}]}]}]}]}}
