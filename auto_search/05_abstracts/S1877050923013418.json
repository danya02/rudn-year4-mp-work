Some users have expressed positive views about this technology, while others hold negative views. This study aimed to examine the attitudes of both users and non-users toward mobile payments by applying text mining on Japanese comments posted on Twitter. The data were collected twice in February 2023. Through the analysis, the study identified keywords related to positive, negative, and risk-related sentiments to gain insight into the expressed opinions. The findings revealed that positive statements highlighted the convenience of mobile payments, ease of ordering, and the value offered through loyalty points. Negative themes encompassed issues like settlement problems and wireless connection troubles. Regarding risks, there were statements such as personal data leaks and various security issues. Furthermore, a comparison between mobile payments and credit cards indicated that mobile payments received fewer risk-related statements and more positive statements compared to credit cards."}]}]}]}}
