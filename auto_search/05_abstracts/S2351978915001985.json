Sport Internet of Things (IoTs) based on the sensor technique and modern communication technology are becoming more and more important to current sport training and daily activities. Sensor-based sport monitoring approaches lead people to take advantage of the wearable sport devices to monitor their own physiological parameters, in which we will focus on the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse measurement. In order to measure these two parameters, we will adopt near-infrared portable tissue oximeter with detection module using STM32 microprocessor. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is becoming a widely used research instrument to measure tissue oxygen (O"}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "2"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") status non-invasively. Continuous-wave spectrometers are the most commonly used devices, which provide semi-quantitative changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules). Through the measurement using the near-infrared technology, we could obtain the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse parameters. After obtaining the above two parameters, the portable device will send the data to the remote coaches or doctors via GPRS/WiFi/Zigbee networks. The data of the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse that is detected by the detection module are processed by the expert decision-making system in order to provide the coaches and doctors with the athlete condition. In addition, the data can be sent to the smart phones of the players, coaches or doctors through GPRS/WiFi networks, in which the blood oxygen saturation and the pulse data of the athletes can be displayed according to the requirement of the remote users. The test results show that the accuracy of measurement is high and the system is stable."}]}]}]}]}}
