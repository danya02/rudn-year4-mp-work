Nevertheless, its extreme combustion properties and its capability of permeating and embrittling most metallic materials produce significant safety concerns. The Hydrogen Incidents and Accidents Database 2.0 (HIAD 2.0) is a public repository that collects data on hydrogen-related undesired events mainly occurred in chemical and process industry. This study conducts an analysis of the HIAD 2.0 database, mining information systematically through a computer science approach known as Business Analytics. Moreover, several hydrogen-induced material failures are investigated to understand their root causes. As a result, a deficiency in planning effective inspection and maintenance activities is highlighted as the common cause of the most severe accidents. The lessons learned from HIAD 2.0 could help to promote a safety culture, to improve the abnormal and normal events management and to stimulate a widespread rollout of hydrogen technologies."}]}]}]}}
