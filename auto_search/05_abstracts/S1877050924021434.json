The legal consultation system designed in this essay, combined with the current situation of the legal industry, takes the Chinese question answering system as the prototype, combined with the open source data retrieval project Lucene.net, expands the data storage types. In this essay, the Chinese word segmentation system developed by Chinese Academy of Sciences is integrated into Lucene.Net platform to make up for its word segmentation deficiency. And the mutual information technology is used to make the legal related words with the same meaning be searched first. When extracting answers in Chinese question answering system, there are often \"missing\" and \"wrong\" answers. In this essay a method of sentence similarity calculation of questions and answers based on Latent Semantic analysis (LSA) is proposed, which uses spatial vector model as representation method and latent semantic analysis theory. A low-dimensional semantic space is constructed by using the dimension reduction method of singular value decomposition, and the sentence similarity between question and answer is computed on the semantic space. Experimental results show that most retrievals can be completed within 20 seconds, and the average unit retrieval time is kept at the millisecond level. Conclusion: This system has more accurate query accuracy and less running time."}]}]}]}}
