A CNN was trained to binary classification on the input. For model improvement and testing, transfer learning using the ImageNet database was applied to the VGG-16 base model. The image dataset was randomized to sets of 60%, 10%, and 30% for model training, validation, and testing, respectively. A stochastic gradient descent was used for optimization. The models were assessed by testing validation accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"role": "results", "id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0025"}, "_": "Results"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Preliminary data demonstrated a nonrandom pattern of accuracy and detectability.
