But an efficient utilization of embedded systems is hindered by lacks in interoperability and flexibility, because they are proprietary. In this paper, an approach for an abstraction layer in the area of embedded systems with respect to low power wireless networks is presented. This layer is used to harmonize interfaces between network-node and application functionality like sensors. The overall goal is to design a dedicated modular low power wireless network with a flexible structure and topology."}]}]}]}}
