Relevant expressions are applicable in diverse areas such as Information Retrieval, document clustering, or classi\ufb01cation and indexing of documents. However, relevant single-words, which represent much of the knowledge in texts, have been a relatively dormant \ufb01eld. In this paper we present a statistical language-independent approach to extract concepts formed by relevant single and multi-word units. By achieving promising precision/recall values, it can be an alternative both to language dependent approaches and to extractors that deal exclusively with multi-words."}]}]}]}}
