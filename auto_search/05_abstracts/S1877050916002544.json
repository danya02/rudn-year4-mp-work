The data rate expected to meet in latest 4G is up to 1Gbps.In**creasing energy efficiency in wireless communications network has attracted the attention recently. In this research different performance metrics that are to be measure and analyze viz. no. of nodes used,power transmission by nodes, wireless channel type, energy efficiency(in bits/joule) data rate in bits per channel use, SNR(signal-to-noise ratio), power transmission(Pt), subcarrier bandwidth, protocol & throughput. The various performance measurements are on the basis of optimal metrics analysis for the wireless communication system to be selected. The parameters measured and reported are power transmission of 5-10"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "dB, energy efficiency in bits per Joule as 4\u00d710"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "20"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", data rate in bits per channel use as 4, SNR as 10"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "dB, probability of error as 10-4, distance between nodes as 100m, FFT size as 512, protocol as Medium Access Control (MAC), throughput as 50%."}]}]}]}]}}
