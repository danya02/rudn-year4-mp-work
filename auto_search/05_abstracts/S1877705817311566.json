The built system consisting of some WiFi routers were configured to form a WiFi mesh network so that it can build the Internet cloud. The operating system used in this research is quick mesh project (QMP). In addition, the WiFi node as a client developed for the internet of things (IoT) applications. These nodes using message queuing protocol telemetry transport (MQTT) based publish and subscribe. WiFi mesh infrastructure is working well with the average value of the measured throughput was 110.5 kbps."}]}]}]}}
