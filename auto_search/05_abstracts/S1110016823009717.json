It encompasses emotional, psychological, and social dimensions, making it a complex and multifaceted construct. Traditionally, assessing and forecasting mental well-being has relied on self-report measures, clinical evaluations, and surveys, which can be subjective, time-consuming, and limited scope. To overcome these drawbacks and offer more precise and timely insights into mental well-being, this study presents a novel approach that uses the power of machine learning. This has been achieved by creating a comprehensive dataset containing various variables relevant to mental health. These variables include behavioral traits like exercise routines, sleep patterns, and social interactions and psychological traits like mood, stress levels, and emotional states. Environmental factors, such as geographic location, climate, and accessibility to mental health care, are also considered. A comprehensive understanding of the elements affecting mental well-being is made possible by this diversified dataset.
