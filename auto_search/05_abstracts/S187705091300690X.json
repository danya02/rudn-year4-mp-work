This can be clearly seen in our life through persistent traffic jam and rising number of accidents. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) based intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have emerged as a cost effective technology that bear a pivotal potential to overcome these difficulties. This technology enables a new broad range of smart city applications around urban sensing including traffic safety, traffic congestion control, road state monitoring, vehicular warning services, and parking management."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spar0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "This manuscript gives a comprehensive review on WSN based ITS solutions.
