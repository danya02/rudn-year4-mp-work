Thus, EGLN1 plays a central role in the hypoxia-inducible factor\u2013mediated hypoxia signaling pathway; however, the posttranslational modifications that control EGLN1 function remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that a lysine monomethylase, SET7, catalyzes EGLN1 methylation on lysine 297, resulting in the repression of EGLN1 activity in catalyzing prolyl hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 \u03b1. Notably, we demonstrate that the methylation mimic mutant of EGLN1 loses the capability to suppress the hypoxia signaling pathway, leading to the enhancement of cell proliferation and the oxygen consumption rate. Collectively, our data identify a novel modification of EGLN1 that is critical for inhibiting its enzymatic activity and which may benefit cellular adaptation to conditions of hypoxia."}]}]}]}}
