The use of techniques for power-efficient operation and network scalability that enable long-term use of a wireless sensor network (WSN) that can be deployed reliably and widely is described. The temporal and spatial variations in air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) near the surface at 16 locations and soil temperature (Ts) and soil water content (SWC) at 10 locations were measured to monitor the active permafrost layer in Alaska from September 2012 to January 2013 and from July to September 2013. The temporal variations in environmental parameters in the soil and near the surface depended on the thawing and freezing of the snow cover in the permafrost regions. The spatial patterns of Ts in the three periods were not similar because of the heterogeneous distribution of snow coverage and depth in winter. On the other hand, the spatial patterns of Ts and SWC had a negative relationship during summer. The spatial variations in Ts and SWC showed a high coefficient of variation (CV) that ranged from 20% to 40%, while the CV of Ta and RH was within 5% except in winter due to the spatially heterogeneous snow cover.
