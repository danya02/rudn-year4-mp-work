Recirculating loop experiments have facilitated the study of signal propagation in long-haul optical transmission systems. However, they are unsuited for developing control and management software for city-scale optical networks with dozens or hundreds of reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer (ROADM) units, diverse interconnection topologies, and dynamic traffic patterns. Large-scale testbeds can help, but may be inflexible and time- or cost-prohibitive. Reconfigurable testbeds such as COSMOS enable piece-wise emulation of a city-scale network by applying space and wavelength switching, dual-use software-defined networking (SDN) controllers, and comb sources, while digital twin models enable software emulation. Results from the development of a digital twin for COSMOS are presented for optical amplifiers and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) including both analytical and machine learning (ML) models."}]}]}]}}
