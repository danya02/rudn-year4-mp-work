And using the limited resources to improve the performance of the network is challengeable. In this paper, we use the poisson cluster process to model the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) heterogeneous cellular network. And we analyze and calculate the laplace transform of the interference, the coverage probability and the average spectrum efficiency of the network based on the tools from stochastic geometry, where the micro base stations are clustered around the macro base stations."}]}]}]}}
