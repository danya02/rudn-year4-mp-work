However, how to evaluate the quality of machine translation, especially considering the nuances in different semantic contexts, remains a challenge. This paper proposes an automatic scoring model for machine translation quality based on deep transfer learning, which aims to accurately perceive and evaluate the quality of translated texts in different semantic contexts. Firstly, a pre-trained deep neural network model is used to extract the semantic feature representation of the sentences in the source language and the target language, so as to capture the semantic information of the sentences. Then, deep transfer learning is used to map the semantic features of source language and target language into the shared feature space. By sharing feature space, an effective relationship is established between the semantic representations of two languages, so as to achieve cross-language quality evaluation. The experimental results show that the model has made significant progress in evaluating the quality of machine translation. Compared with traditional methods, this model can evaluate translation quality more accurately and has better generalization ability. The automatic scoring model of machine translation quality based on deep transfer learning not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of machine translation quality assessment, but also provides new ideas and methods for future research."}]}]}]}}
