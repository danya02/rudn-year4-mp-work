In modern greenhouses, several measurement points are required to trace down the local climate parameters in different parts of a large scale greenhouse in order to ensure proper operation of the greenhouse automation system. Cabling would make the measurement system expensive, vulnerable and also difficult to relocate once installed. This paper presents a WSN prototype consisting of MicaZ nodes which are used to measure greenhouses\u2019 temperature, light, pressure and humidity. Measurement data have been shared with the help of IoT. With this system farmers can control their greenhouse from their mobile phones or computers which have internet connection."}]}]}]}]}}
