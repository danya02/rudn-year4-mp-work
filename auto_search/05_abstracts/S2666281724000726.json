We present our new framework for analysing this resource with an innovative combination of time series and text mining methods. The framework is intended to create a tool to analyse and operationally summarise extended trails of social media messages, thus enabling investigators for the first time to drill down into specific moments at which sentiment analysis has detected a change of tone indicative of a particularly strong and significant response. Crucially, the method will give investigators an opportunity to reduce the time and resource commitment required for ongoing and hands-on analysis of digital communications on media such as Texts/SMS, WhatsApp and Messenger."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0230", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ls0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Digital forensics today often entails the challenge of analysing long-term \u2018conversations\u2019 via SMSs, Whatsapp or similar mobile-orientated media."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The conversational style and lexical complexity of such exchanges are also a challenge for automated analysis with Machine Learning tools."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "We introduce a layered architecture that runs a time-staggered, semi-supervised Named-entity recognition and Sentiment analysis on conversations."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0040"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0040", "view": "all"}, "_": "Mixing lexical, volume and sentiment analysis, we create \u2018sentiment time-series\u2019 that pinpoint possible events of interest in the timeline."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0050"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0050", "view": "all"}, "_": "Early tests on real SMS/WA conversations suggest that the sentiment time-series approach is effective in assisting human analysts."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
