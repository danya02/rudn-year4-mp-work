WMN is an emerging technology which is used to connect various types of networks to the internet. As the trafficdensity is very high fromthe client mesh to the gateways, load balancing in these networks has become an important research issue. Thus, there is a need for multipath routing which can exploit the multi-radio capabilities along with the load balancing mechanism. Furthermore, the dynamic and shared nature of wireless medium makes the task of supporting QoS for video streaming applications challenging. Towards this,MDCis an effective technique for the video transmission over the unpredictable routes because of varying channel conditions.In this work,we compute multiple paths using Passive Interference andDelay Aware (PIDA) metric and performload balancing using MDC. Proposed work is implemented in Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing protocol using NS2 simulator. The results reveal that proposed technique withMDCperforms better in terms of PSNR, frame delay and frame loss compared to existing technique"}]}]}]}}
