The existing weather service systems cannot provide accurate local weather nowcasting, because of their prediction processes, and a lack of actual measured information in the atmospheric boundary layer. Technology is ready for the development and introduction of drone-based mobile automatic weather stations to support improved road weather management. This systematic review evaluates the readiness of the required technologies through surveying a wide range of papers dealing with the introduction of drone based meteorological measurements and their utilization for road weather management. It identifies the requirements of such systems, analyses the applicability of drones for weather monitoring and nowcasting, studies the required specification of drones and their instrumentations and investigates the possible realization of planned measurements. The review results show that (i) significant societal-economic value can be generated with the improvement of nowcasting and forecasting systems for road users (ii) technology is ready for the development and introduction of new road weather monitoring and management services, however UAV weather tolerance must be improved (iii) new concepts and software solutions are required for processing the measured data and rapid sharing of nowcasting information."}]}]}]}}
