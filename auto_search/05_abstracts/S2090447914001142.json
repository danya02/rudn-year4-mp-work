The parameters such as magnitude and phase angles of voltage and current, frequency, rate-of-change-of-frequency (ROCOF), active and reactive powers are measured using a state-of-the-art customized Zigbee enabled phasor measurement unit (ZPMU). The data from different ZPMUs at different bus nodes are acquired with the help of WSN system in order to have a centralized monitoring of different equipments load status. The coordination among different parameters for different buses and/or equipment is done from a centralized control room within the substation or plant with the help of substation management software and Zigbee networking. The data thus collected are utilized to study the power flow status of the different buses on real time basis and are stored within a server based database for future analysis purposes."}]}]}]}}
