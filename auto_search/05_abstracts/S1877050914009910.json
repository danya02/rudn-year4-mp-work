This results in loss of information and waste energy. Early congestion detection is thus of high importance in such WSN applications to avoid the propagation of such a problem and to reduce its consequences. Different detection metrics are used in the congestion control literature. However, a comparative study that investigates the different metrics in real sensor motes environment is missing. This paper focuses on this issue and compares some detection metrics in a testbed network with MICAz motes. Results show the effectiveness of each method in different scenarios and concludes that the combination of buffer length and channel load constitute the better candidate for early and fictive detection."}]}]}]}}
