Recently, the integration of wearables and artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted extensive academic and technological attention for its powerful high-dimensional data processing of wearable biosensing networks. This work reviews the recent developments in AI-assisted wearable biosensing devices in disease diagnostics and fatigue monitoring demonstrating the trend towards personalised medicine with highly efficient, cost-effective, and accurate point-of-care diagnosis by finding hidden patterns in biosensing data and detecting abnormalities. The reliability of adaptive learning and synthetic data and data privacy still need further investigation to realise personalised medicine in the next decade. Due to the worldwide popularity of smartphones, they have been utilised for sensor readout, wireless data transfer, data processing and storage, result display, and cloud server communication leading to the development of smartphone-based biosensing systems. The recent advances have demonstrated a promising future for the healthcare system because of the increasing data processing power, transfer efficiency and storage capacity and diversifying functionalities."}]}]}]}}
