Cached content in several LEO satellites must be delivered via inter-satellite links (ISLs) with appropriate routing techniques. Until now, content caching and routing techniques have been optimized independently. To tackle this issue, the optimization of selecting a content-cached satellite and routing is jointly performed, using the example of Earth observation data cached across multiple satellites. In this paper, we first formulate a dynamic power minimization problem constrained by the queue stability of all LEO satellites, where the control variables are the selection of content-cached satellite and routing in every satellite. To solve this long-term time-averaged problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization framework to transform the original problem into a series of slot-by-slot problems. Moreover, we prove that the average power consumption and the average queue backlog by the proposed algorithm can be upper-bounded via theoretical analysis. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses existing independent content-retrieval algorithms in terms of power consumption, queue backlog, and fairness."}]}]}]}}
