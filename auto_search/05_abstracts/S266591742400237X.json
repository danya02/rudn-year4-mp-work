Both foreign and domestic, the research of network forensics is in the beginning stage, and the technology of network forensics is developed in this background. An analysis system of fuzzy decision tree based network forensics, network forensics personnel to assist in the network environment of computer crime forensics analysis. The experimental results of this method are given and compared with the existing methods of the analysis results. The experimental results show that this system can classify most kinds of events (the average correct classification rate. 91.16\u00a0%), can provide comprehensible information for network forensics personnel, to assist forensic personnel for rapid and efficient analysis of the evidence."}]}]}]}}
