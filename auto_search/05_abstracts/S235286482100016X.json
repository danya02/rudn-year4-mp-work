Although the hierarchical routing protocol can effectively cope with large-scale application scenarios, how to elect a secure cluster head and balance the network load becomes an enormous challenge. In this paper, a Trust Management-based and\u00a0\u200bLow Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy protocol (LEACH-TM) is proposed. In LEACH-TM, by using the number of dynamic decision cluster head nodes, residual energy and density of neighbor nodes, the size of the cluster can be better constrained to improve energy efficiency, and avoid excessive energy consumption of a node. Simultaneously, the trust management scheme is introduced into LEACH-TM to defend against internal attacks. The simulation results show that, compared with LEACH-SWDN protocol and LEACH protocol, LEACH-TM outperforms in prolonging the network lifetime and balancing the energy consumption, and can effectively mitigate the influence of malicious nodes on cluster head selection, which can greatly guarantee the security of the overall network."}]}]}]}}
