However, airports comprise a limited number of runways. The reduction in the number of paths that aircraft can transit takes place in terminal arrival routes, which act as an interface between incoming routes and approach trajectories. This occurrence entails that air traffic has to be carefully managed in terminal arrival routes in order to prevent possible bottlenecks. This work presents an optimisation model that manages not only approach and landing operations, but also terminal arrival routes, deciding on runway assignment, terminal arrival route selection and aircraft trajectory. The proposed integrated model leads to a mixed integer non-linear problem. For its resolution, a Benders decomposition is proposed. On the one hand, the master model deals with runway assignment and terminal arrival route selection, making use of a set of binary variables. On the other hand, the sub-model deals with the trajectory calculation problem, managing a set of continuous variables and minimising a combination of fuel consumption and delay."}]}]}]}}
