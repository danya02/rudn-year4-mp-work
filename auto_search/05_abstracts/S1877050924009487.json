Due to gaps in the existing waste collection, treatment and recovery methods, large-scale unscientific disposal and lesser waste recovery have been observed. Insufficient source segregation, unorganised efforts, less awareness and indifference towards malpractice, and a lack of strict implementation were identified as the causes through literature review, surveys and interviews, Therefore, there is a need for a system of interventions, which organises efforts toward waste management and reduces the tolerance for source segregation errors. This paper aims to provide a solution that increases community participation and prevents the generation of mixed waste to ensure waste recovery. The proposed framework integrates municipal solid waste, human elements, and technology into an intelligent app-based system. This includes a smart bin that segregates waste at the source through image classification and an application for communication and data collection."}]}]}]}}
