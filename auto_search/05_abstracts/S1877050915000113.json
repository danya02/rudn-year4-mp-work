The use of cognition technique based on the Observe, Orient, Decide and Act loop (OODA) is proposed to construct proactive networks. The network performance degradation in knowledge acquisition and malicious node presence is a problem that exists. The use of continuous time dynamic neural network is considered to achieve cognition. The variance in service rates of user nodes is used to detect malicious activity in heterogeneous networks. The improved malicious node detection rates are proved through the experimental results presented in this paper."}]}]}]}}
