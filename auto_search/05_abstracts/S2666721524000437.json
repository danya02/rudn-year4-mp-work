Therefore, focus has shifted to managing claims with systematic processes, yet challenges related to claim preparation persist. Drawing from political governance, where data analytics promote self-governance to overcome similar challenges, this study contrasts politics with construction claims, aiming to investigate potential for adopting similar data-driven approaches in the construction claim context. Through a systematic literature review in conjunction with ten industry interviews, we present similarities in control mechanisms and disciplinary powers as regulatory elements but reveal dissimilarities in self-governance and utilisation of data analytics. This study proposes categorizing initiatives in claim preparation to people-led, organisational-led, and data-led with data analytics pivotal in each. Through the application of data analytics resembling governmentality within the realm of political governance, the study reveals that the integration of self-governance and smart data analytics presents a potential solution for effectively addressing the challenges inherent in the preparation of construction claims."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Construction claims remain inevitable and repetitive."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Stagnation exists in offering practical remedies for the issues encountered in claim management."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Governmentality has a real potential to address the highlighted challenges through embedding smart data analytics in the claim preparation initiatives across a claim's lifecycle."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Initiatives of claim preparation were categorized to people-led, organisational-led, and data-led with data analytics pivotal in each."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
