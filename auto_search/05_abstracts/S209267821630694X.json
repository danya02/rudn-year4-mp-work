Thus, it is essential to design pipeline routes to be eco-friendly, economical and safe. Obstacle avoidance is one of the main problems that affect pipeline route selection. In this study, we propose a technique for designing an automatic obstacle avoidance. The Laplacian smoothing algorithm was used to make automatically generated pipeline routes fairer. The algorithms were fast and the method was shown to be effective and easy to use in a simple set of case studies."}]}]}]}}
