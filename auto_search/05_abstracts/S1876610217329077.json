We address the issue of scarcity of information about the building properties by employing new sensing technology. The aim of this paper is to introduce an open-source, modular and low-cost wireless sensor network of building performance assessment, which is independent of an onsite landline internet connection. Due to its modularity, the WSN can be complemented with new sensors without altering the system. We present the design process, the deployment and monitoring results of an easily-deployable wireless sensor network (WSN) for in-situ performance assessment of occupied buildings. A case study of the deployment of the WSN in a single family home in Switzerland is presented. We demonstrate the quick installation of the WSN and live measurements over multiple months. We derive the thermal properties of the envelope (U-values) from the measured data, and compare them to the values used in the code-based assessment of the building."}]}]}]}}
