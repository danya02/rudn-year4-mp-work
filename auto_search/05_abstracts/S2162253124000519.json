However, the signaling transduction of TGF-\u03b21 in the bone-forming microenvironment remains unknown. Here, we showed that microRNA-191 (miR-191) was downregulated during osteogenesis and further decreased by osteo-favoring TGF-\u03b21 in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).

Hydrogels embedded with miR-191-low BMSCs displayed a powerful bone repair effect. Mechanistically, transcription factors BMI1 and SMAD2 coordinately controlled miR-191 level. In detail, BMI1 and pSMAD2 were both upregulated by TGF-\u03b21 under osteogenic condition. SMAD2 activated miR-191 transcription, while BMI1 competed with SMAD2 for binding to miR-191 promoter region, thus disturbing the activation of SMAD2 on miR-191 and reducing miR-191 level. Altogether, our findings reveal that miR-191 regulated by TGF-\u03b21-induced BMI1 and SMAD2 negatively modulated bone formation and regeneration, and inhibition of miR-191 might be therapeutically useful to enhance bone repair in clinic."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S2162253124000519/fx1", "id": "aep-link-id7"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Wang and colleagues describe a novel mechanism of action for TGF-\u03b21 signaling during osteogenesis.
