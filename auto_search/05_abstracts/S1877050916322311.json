Working together, they are able to consolidate and deliver the networking components using standard IT virtualization technologies making, in such a way, carriers infrastructures more flexible and adaptive in respect to the needs of both end-users and service providers."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spar0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "In this context, this paper presents the architecture and the related prototype of a video broadcasting service tailored for SDN-NVF enabled networks, allowing network and application functions deployment simplification and management cost reduction. In such a way, the proposed solution enables small/medium and unusual content providers to share events with a restricted number of interested users without the need of adopting a dedicated and expensive data delivery infrastructure."}]}]}]}}
