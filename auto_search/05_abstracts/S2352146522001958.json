The objective is to establish a data-driven method to recognize employment core areas and identify their residential catchment areas. More specifically, mobility traces are firstly mined to detect the home and work places of each vehicle according to temporal patterns of the day and repetition patterns over distinct days. A spatial density distribution analysis is then conducted to identify the employment cores and sub-cores. The core-periphery patterns between the cores and other areas are further investigated by building a connection graph based on the home and work locations over spatial zones. The graph-based clustering algorithm is employed to partition the graph so as to identify bonded zones as communities and interpret the catchment areas pertaining to different employment cores. A case study has been applied with the field-collected Floating Car Data in the Paris Region to showcase the method applicability. Overall, this study offers a referential framework for capturing urban spatial dynamics by digital traces, with the advantages of being data-driven, scalable for large-scale, and less dependent on prior expertise. The results may contribute to the planning guidance corresponding to up-to-date changes."}]}]}]}}
