But the semantic interpretation of multimedia is obsolete without some mechanism for understanding semantic content that is not explicitly available. Manual annotation is the only source to overwhelming this, which is not only time consuming and costly but also lacks semantic enrichment in terms of concept diversity and concept enrichability. In this paper, we present semantically enhanced information extraction model that calculate the semantic intensity (SI) of each object in the image and then enhance the tagged concept with the assistance of lexical and conceptual knowledgebases\u00a0.i.e. WordNet and ConceptNet. Noises, redundant and unusual words are then filtered out by means of various techniques like semantic similarity, stopwords and words unification. The experiment has been carried out on the LabelMe datasets. Results demonstrate the substantial improvement in terms of concept diversity, concept enrichment and retrieval performance."}]}]}]}}
