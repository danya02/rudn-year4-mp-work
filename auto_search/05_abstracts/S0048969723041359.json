The empirical IEUBK model considers gastric phase adsorption only and of the three exposure pathways (ingestion, inhalation and dermal) assessed by the theoretical NCR model, ingestion was the major exposure route. The reason for the similarity in outcomes of the two models is unknown, however the close correlation may be due to broadly similar formulations and, or that neurological and non-carcinogenic risks may be related to the adverse effects of Pb on bodily function. Parallel studies of human health risk based on BLL and NCR models have not been attempted previously and this opportunity to compare results from the two health risk assessments employing the same soil metal data is therefore unique."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0020"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0015", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S0048969723041359/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0030", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Two human health risk assessment models for soil metals were compared."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The IEUBK and USEPA model results were significantly similar."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "This comparison of these assessments using the same soil metal data is unique."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The reason for the similarity in outcomes of the two models is unknown."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "The similarity in results may be due to broadly similar formulations."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
