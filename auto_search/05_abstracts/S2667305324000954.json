However, the absence of quality metadata often hinders the findability and representation of this data. In this study we specifically focus on keywords, proposing a strategy for their automatic generation. In particular, we employed five existing keyword extraction methodologies (BERT, RAKE, YAKE, TEXTRANK, and ChatGPT) and proposed a novel hybrid methodology, named BRYT (read as bright). Our evaluation of these algorithms was conducted using Gestalt String Matching and Jaccard Similarity techniques. We validated our study using a selection of datasets from the EU data portal, specifically choosing those that exhibited potentially high-quality metadata. This included datasets that contained a substantial number of keywords and had comprehensive, relevant metadata. The results showed that 69.1% of the dataset keywords majorly matched (more than 50% or 5 keywords), 24.7% minorly matched (up to 50% or 5 keywords), and 6.2% did not match. The proposed hybrid model, BRYT, outperformed other algorithms in the major matches, while ChatGPT was a close second. YAKE outperformed the others in minor matches, and ChatGPT was again a close second. The evaluations concluded that BRYT consistently extracted more representative keywords in major matches, highlighting its effectiveness in improving findability. This study sets up a favorable field for further representative metadata extraction and population, making the data more findable, discoverable, and accessible."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e1526", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1527"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1529", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1530", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e1534", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S2667305324000954/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1535", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1536"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1538", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1539", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1541"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1542"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1545", "view": "all"}, "_": "Analysis of European data portals revealed a significant lack of representative metadata associated with datasets."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1547"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1550", "view": "all"}, "_": "The importance of high-quality metadata, especially keywords, was established to improve data findability on open data portals."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1552"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1555", "view": "all"}, "_": "We evaluated different methods for extracting keywords from dataset descriptions to improve findability and proposed a hybrid method, BRYT, which proved to be more efficient."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1557"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1560", "view": "all"}, "_": "We also explored which types of descriptions are most effective for extracting representative keywords with particular methodologies."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
