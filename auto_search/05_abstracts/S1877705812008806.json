The objectives of this paper is the Performance evaluation of a WiMAX system under various diversity schemes (Selection combining, Maximal ratio combining and Equal gain combining), employing different adaptive transmission policies, such as Optimal power and rate adaptation policy, Optimal rate adaptation with constant transmit power policy, Channel inversion with fixed rate policy, and Truncated channel inversion policy, subjected to co-channel interference. The WiMAX system incorporates OFDM with BPSK modulation as the transmission scheme. Simulated results of the estimated spectrum efficiency shows that the implementation of Optimal power and rate adaptation policy is highly effective to combat co-channel interference in the WiMAX communication system, under Selection combining."}]}]}]}}
