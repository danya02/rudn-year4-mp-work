In this paper, we use LDA to extract topics of comments about movies, and identify the emotional tendencies related to topics. As a result, we enrich user interest model and product feature model based on emotional tendencies to improve content-based recommendation algorithms. Most of prior work on applying sentiment classification to recommendation systems only consider the use of sentiment dictionaries to judge polarity, and adopt pattern matching methods to identify features. This paper uses BERT to train sentiment classification models and uses LDA to extract topics. The algorithm is run on the movie review database crawled from Douban, and the experimental result showed that the diversity of recommendation lists had been significantly improved."}]}]}]}}
