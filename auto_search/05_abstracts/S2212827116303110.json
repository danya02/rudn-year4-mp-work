Besides structured databases, written reports hold unstructured information hardly exploitable due to the lack of vocabulary and syntax standardization. In this paper we present a methodology and natural language processing approach to exploit these documents. Our method consists in providing connections based on supervised retrieval of domain-specific expressions. No prior document analysis are required to drive the algorithm. It underlines a scale of specificity in pattern visualization. This allows relevant and specific information extraction for feedback (e.g. design stage, after-sales service)."}]}]}]}}
