This in turn persuaded him to gather the immense information of need in the form of theory, tools, intuitions, visuals, and ultimately as the form of abstract objects. In modern Information practice, the art of Conceptualization and the induction of the data driven paradigm identifies the user query intention over a Conceptual network to mold a confident search segment of user choice. The proposed Conceptualization with Typed Terms of Query (CTTQ) approach derives a confident segment of the user query which is contextually measured by means of novel randomized Machine learning algorithms and its surrogates. The Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) measures of the CTTQ show the usefulness of the query suggestions. It's efficiency improvements are represented with varying impact lexical feature indicator ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "\u03b8"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") values."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0100", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ls0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The Conceptualization with Typed Terms of the Query (CTTQ) is a data conceptualization approach using ML algorithms."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The confident numeric representation approach of CTTQ can be used in various Information management tasks."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "It is designed to use with the existing search services like SM, SEM, and SEO and web services like SEOClerks, Fiverr, etc."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0070"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "pr0070", "view": "all"}, "_": "The Impact lexical feature analysis gives better results for CTTQ."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
