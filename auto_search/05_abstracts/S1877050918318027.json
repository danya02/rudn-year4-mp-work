Therefore, some nodes may become isolated during the operation of the network. The existing node connectivity algorithms for WSN aim to reduce the number of isolated nodes and increase the network coverage, but the distance between the isolated nodes and potential parent nodes is not properly considered during node connection. In this paper a novel approach for node connection with ZigBee-based WSN is proposed which applies the Dixon\u2019s test to the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) samples. It allows accurate node connection even with a small number of RSSI values by eliminating the outliers. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed scheme consistently displays higher accuracy than the existing schemes with various numbers of RSSI samples, while the processing time required for node connection is very small."}]}]}]}}
