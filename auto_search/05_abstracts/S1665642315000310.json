Mobility of nodes causes network partition. This leads to heavy overhead and less packet forwarding ratio. In this research work, Residual Energy based Reliable Multicast Routing Protocol (RERMR) is proposed to attain more network lifetime and increased packet delivery and forwarding rate. A multicast backbone is constructed to achieve more stability based on node familiarity and trustable loop. Reliable path criterion is estimated to choose best reliable path among all available paths. Data packets will be forwarded once the reliable path is chosen. We have also demonstrated that residual energy of paths aids to provide maximum network lifetime. Based on the simulation results, the proposed work achieves better performance than previous protocols in terms of packet reliability rate, network stability rate, end to end delay, end to end transmission and communication overhead."}]}]}]}}
