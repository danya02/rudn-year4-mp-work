Lithium-ion (Li-ion)-based Battery Energy storage (BES) is a prominent approach that is widely adopted for managing large-scale renewable energy generation. Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a critical role in optimizing battery performance of BES by monitoring parameters such as overcharging, the state of health (SoH), cell protection, real-time data, and fault detection to ensure reliability. Previous studies have concluded that the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) with LoRa ensures effective real-time monitoring of the BMS of Li-ion batteries. This study proposed and implemented a customized LoRa and IoT-based hardware system with a gateway to acquire parameters such as terminal voltage, current, charge voltage, charge current, cycle, temperature, state of charge (SoC), and SoH, and log them into the cloud server. An OMnet++-based Framework for LoRa (FLoRa) simulation was implemented to analyze the power consumption and residual energy of the customized LoRa nodes. The simulation was configured with a spread factor of 7, a carrier frequency of 433\u00a0MHz, a bandwidth of 125\u00a0KHz, and a transmission power of 2 dBm. The simulation results indicated that Node 3 had the highest mean power consumption (0.028233) and total energy consumption (0.146592), whereas Node 0 exhibited the lowest mean power consumption (0.023413) and total energy consumption (0.070204). Additionally, a comprehensive dataset encompassing voltage, current, and time was created and utilized for precise calculations of the battery's capacity and state of health, with potential use in future predictions."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Customized LoRa based hardware for real-time data acquisition of BMS."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "FLoRa simulates power consumption and residual energy analysis of LoRa."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Comprehensive dataset encompassing voltage, current, and time is created."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "IoT based system with LoRa and Gateway is realized."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
