The main focus is to study the performance of optical wireless system by using optimal path selection criteria using AHP algorithm. The atmospheric parameters such as air temperature, attenuation due to scattering and absorption, beam deflection, optical noise etc under varying atmospheric turbulence conditions were compared to select a best alternative optical path between transmitter and receiver. The performance degradation patterns for multiple optical links are tested to achieve maximum signal to noise ratio at every node. The multiple attribute decision method is employed at every node which involves selection from among finite number of alternatives. Different alternatives, Attributes, weight or relative importance of each attribute and measure of performance of alternatives with respect to the attributes are the main parts in each decision table of MADM methods. The simulation results are presented, base on the given finite attribute to achieve the maximum optical link availability as well as reliability of data rate in a high speed data network."}]}]}]}}
