In this context, farmers\u2019 use of a decision-support system is unavoidable. Indeed, the real-time supervision of microclimatic conditions are the only way to know the water needs of a culture. Wireless sensor networks are playing an important role with the advent of the Internet of things and the generalization of the use of web in the community of the farmers. It will be judicious to make supervision possible via web services. The IOT cloud represents platforms that allow to create web services suitable for the objects integrated on the Internet. In this paper we propose an application prototype for precision farming using a wireless sensor network with an IOT cloud."}]}]}]}}
