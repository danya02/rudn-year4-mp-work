Yet, untracked or poorly tracked species and undiscoverable or inaccessible data for the species that have been tracked mean that gaps in the knowledge of where and when species occur are still an issue for conservation. These gaps in knowledge of species movements have been termed the \u201cmovement shortfall\u201d. Here, we quantify the movement shortfall for North American migratory birds by comprehensively reviewing full annual cycle tracking data and identifying gaps and biases in how, where, and what species are tracked with electronic tracking devices. We found 30 species for which tracking is not feasible given body size constraints, no data for 291 trackable species, and restricted or reduced data accessibility for an additional 59 species. Thus, despite the ability to track most species, the movement shortfall remains a constraint to informing conservation strategies for 56\u00a0% of North American migratory bird species. The number increases to 65\u00a0% when considering species with restricted or reduced data accessibility, further limiting access to this information. Moreover, 23\u00a0% of the tracking data stems from low precision tracking technologies reducing the implementation and effectiveness to conservation actions. A lack of species and population data hinders conservation and biases management decisions, ultimately making inefficient use of conservation resources. We encourage researchers to consider these gaps in their decisions about future tracking efforts, conservation management, and data archiving practices."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0075", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0035"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0075"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0035", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S0006320723003257/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0080", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0040"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0090"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0100", "view": "all"}, "_": "Of the 569 North American migratory bird species considered in our study, 5% cannot be tracked and 51% have not been tracked."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0095"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0105", "view": "all"}, "_": "Of the 248 tracked species in our study, 65% have restricted or reduced access data."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0100"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0110", "view": "all"}, "_": "Smaller-bodied birds and short distance, low concern species were less likely to be tracked but were more likely to have open access data."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0105"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0115", "view": "all"}, "_": "Low precision tracking technologies (light-level geolocator) comprises 23% of the tracking data discovered during our review process."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
