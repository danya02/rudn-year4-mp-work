Large and complex immunopeptidomics datasets can now be routinely generated using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry techniques. The analysis of this data \u2013 often consisting of multiple replicates/conditions \u2013 rarely follows a standard data processing pipeline, hindering the reproducibility and depth of analysis of immunopeptidomic data. Here, we present Immunolyser, an automated pipeline designed to facilitate computational analysis of immunopeptidomic data with a minimal initial setup. Immunolyser brings together routine analyses, including peptide length distribution, peptide motif analysis, sequence clustering, peptide-MHC binding affinity prediction, and source protein analysis. Immunolyser provides a user-friendly and interactive interface via its webserver and is freely available for academic purposes at https://immunolyser.erc.monash.edu/. The open-access source code can be downloaded at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/prmunday/Immunolyser. We anticipate that Immunolyser will serve as a prominent computational pipeline to facilitate effortless and reproducible analysis of immunopeptidomic data."}]}]}]}}
