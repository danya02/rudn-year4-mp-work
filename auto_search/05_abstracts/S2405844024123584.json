However, the research on TIIA is insufficient, and the limited sample size may affect the robustness of the results. Furthermore, the majority of research on traditional Chinese medicine monomers is currently limited to the experimental stage, lacking further clinical validation. Conducting standardized animal experiments and reporting their findings can enhance the quality of evidence from animal studies, laying the foundation for future clinical trials."}]}]}]}}
