Often, small-scale miners operate in, or adjacent to large-scale mining (LSM) concessions, potentially leading to conflict. Multilateral organizations and some governments have encouraged collaboration between ASM and LSM, prompting an academic debate over the risks and rewards of such approaches. This article argues that the local political economy of the mining sector is of crucial importance in determining the feasibility of ASM-LSM collaboration. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) traceability schemes, intended to ensure that minerals and metals are \u2018conflict-free\u2019, are a major part of the political economy, and heavily influence local governance. Traceability schemes may be seen as a type of decentralized enclave economy. The article uses two case studies of ASM-LSM agreements in the DRC to explore how traceability may impact efforts at collaboration."}]}]}]}}
