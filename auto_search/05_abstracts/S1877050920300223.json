The IDS have to process millions of network packets with many features, which delay the detection of anomalies. To understand the attacks of the past and to design proper tools to defeat their impending peril, Host-based IDS or HIDS, establishes to be a robust design. An Efficacious Intellectual Framework for Host based Intrusion Detection with Rule Structure Generation and Pattern Matching algorithm sets the rule structure for the unknown attack generated by using Association Rule Mining in the Map Reduce Framework. It is accomplished in two stages. In the first stage, an efficacious Rule structure is generated using Intellectual method. In the second stage, Brute Force algorithm pattern matching algorithm is utilized in the proposed framework. It is proper to audit and review logs for malicious activity. Notably intrusions are rare after proven analysis to prevent the attacks to happen. The present HIDS establishes to be a robust design for understanding of attacks of the past and determining effective methods to defeat their future threats."}]}]}]}}
