WMN is considered as a novel wireless network archetype as it does not rely on any of the fixed infrastructures. However, there exist some challenging issues in designing of the WMN such as vulnerability towards malicious attacks and communication cost. Several routing protocols i.e. ARAN, SAODV or TAODV have been proposed but lead to above mentioned drawbacks. In this paper, a novel approach for Secure Routing Protocol is proposed which overcomes drawbacks like- high communication cost, man-in-middle attack, wormhole attack and rushing attack. Furthermore, the approach is proved by showing the proper simulation results."}]}]}]}}
