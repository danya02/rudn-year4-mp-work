The task is highly practical since non-parallel multilingual data exist in far greater quantities than parallel corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Here we propose a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora from Wikipedia articles. We also introduce a method for extracting truly parallel sentences that are filtered out from noisy or just comparable sentence pairs. We describe our implementation of a specialized tool for this task as well as training and adaption of a machine translation system that supplies our filter with additional information about the similarity of comparable sentence pairs."}]}]}]}}
