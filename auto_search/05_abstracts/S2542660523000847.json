FANETs (Flying Ad-hoc Networks) are a clear example of heterogeneous multi-modal use cases, which require strict quality in the network communications, as well as the coordination of the computing capabilities, in order to operate correctly the final service. In this paper, we present a Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) framework designed for the allocation of dataflow applications, composed of nano-services that produce or consume data, in a wireless infrastructure, such as an airborne network. To address the problem, an anypath-based heuristic algorithm that considers the quality demand of the communication between nano-services is proposed, coined as Quality-Revenue Paired Anypath Dataflow VNE (QRPAD-VNE). We also provide a simulation environment for the evaluation of its performance according to the virtual network (VN) request load in the system. Finally, we show the suitability of a multi-parameter framework in conjunction with anypath routing in order to have better performance results that guarantee minimum quality in the wireless communications."}]}]}]}}
