Using relevant keywords, we conducted a search in the Web of Science Core Collection on September 23, 2022, retrieving a total of 47,681 documents with 987,979 references. We identified two prominent research trends: 'noninvasive brain stimulation' and 'invasive brain stimulation.' These methods have interconnected over time, forming a cluster focused on evidence synthesis. Noteworthy emerging research trends encompassed 'transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation,' 'DBS/epilepsy in the pediatric population,' 'spinal cord stimulation,' and 'brain-machine interface.' While progress has been made for various neurostimulation interventions, their approval as adjuvant treatments remains limited, and optimal stimulation parameters lack consensus. Enhancing communication between experts of both neurostimulation types and encouraging novel translational research could foster further development. These findings offer valuable insights for funding agencies and research groups, guiding future directions in the field."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0040", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "First broad scientometric analysis over 100 years of research on neuromodulation interventions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The analysis encompassed 47,681 documents and 987,979 references."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Major research trends were \u2018noninvasive brain stimulation\u2019 and \u2018invasive brain stimulation\u2019."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "USA, Germany and UK are dominating the research field, and China is developing rapidly."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Influence of authors, institutions, countries and latest research trends were identified."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
