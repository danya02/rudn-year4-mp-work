A multi-path routing protocol based on improved ant colony algorithm, Fortified Ant protocol, is proposed. The protocol first adds a sorting algorithm based on the ant colony algorithm, and introduces the concept of elite ants to improve the speed of routing optimization. Secondly, this paper also studies the multipath transmission of self-organizing networks. The simulation results show that compared with ADOV, DSR and AOC routing algorithms, the algorithm can quickly find multiple paths with better quality, with fast convergence and overhead. Less advantage."}]}]}]}}
