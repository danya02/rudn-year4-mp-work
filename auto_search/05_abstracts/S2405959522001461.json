The UAV receives the collected sensed data from the mobile sinks wirelessly in order to deliver them to various IoT-based users\u2019 devices. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve optimization in terms of energy consumption minimization and network lifetime enhancement."}]}]}]}}
