Despite the extensive research on SC, there is a lack of comprehensive survey on technologies, solutions, applications, and challenges for SC. In this article, the development of SC is first reviewed and its characteristics, architecture, and advantages are summarized. Next, key technologies such as semantic extraction, semantic encoding, and semantic segmentation are discussed and their corresponding solutions in terms of efficiency, robustness, adaptability, and reliability are summarized. Applications of SC to UAV communication, remote image sensing and fusion, intelligent transportation, and healthcare are also presented and their strategies are summarized. Finally, some challenges and future research directions are presented to provide guidance for further research of SC."}]}]}]}}
