The assessment of the business environment largely depends on public perception. Aiming to explore the public perception of business environment, this paper organically combines the big data text mining and sentiment analysis (SA). The results show that the combination of big data text mining and SA can reflect the theme characteristics, reduce the bias of sentiment and text analysis, and clearly show the public perception of the business environment. The empirical study found that the public perception of business environment depends on not only the four dimensions of business environment, but also the influence of public opinion that cannot be ignored. The public's low recognition of the business environment in Heilongjiang Province mainly includes backward economic development, serious brain drain, low government efficiency, imperfect policies, administrative law enforcement, regional climate and urban construction. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to improve the high-standard market system to promote economic development, enhance the efficiency of government services, improve government policies, effectively enhance law enforcement, strengthen infrastructure construction and promote cultural innovation."}]}]}]}}
