The studies we report here demonstrate that aging-associated REG\u03b3 decline predisposes to decreasing tau turnover, as in a tauopathy. The REG\u03b3 proteasome promotes degradation of human and mouse tau, notably phosphorylated tau and toxic tau oligomers that shuttle between the cytoplasm and nuclei.
