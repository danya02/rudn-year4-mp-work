In Lascaux Cave, a previous attempt to mechanically remove black stains was followed by reformation of the stain in months, suggesting that microbial recolonization had taken place. On this basis, we hypothesized that mechanical cleaning (a routine cleaning method for conservation of heritage sites) leaves a residual microbial community that can also serve as pioneer community, i.e. a community of early microbial residents that triggers subsequent microbial successions involved in the reformation of black stains. We monitored post-cleaning microbial recolonization over 19 months in the Apse of Lascaux Cave (France), after using two methods of mechanical cleaning (scalpel alone, or scalpel\u00a0+\u00a0sponge).
