The dataset contains the IDs of tweets tagged with the hashtags #sustainableproducts, #ecoproducts, #ecofriendlyproducts, and #greenproducts. The time period spans 10 years and includes a total of over 140 thousand tweets from around the world. The article describes the process of obtaining the data using Twarc and the Twitter developer's academic researcher API and describes the preprocessing techniques used to identify keywords, hashtags, topics, and sentiments expressed in the conversations. The analysis identifies key attributes of each sustainable product category as well as commonalities and differences within and across categories. The data have the potential to be reused in future research related to sustainable consumption and production, including further analysis of the sentiments and attitudes expressed in the Twitter conversations and comparison with other social media platforms or survey data. In addition, the data can serve as a basis for marketing strategies and product design by enterprises or organizations seeking to promote sustainable products."}]}]}]}}
