Assamese is a versatile language added with diversified linguistic features. Analysis and manipulation of such a rich language in terms of its vocabulary is really challenging. It requires incorporation of syntactic level annotations like Parts of Speech (PoS) tags into the text for the purpose of efficient and effective processing for different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our research mainly focuses on extraction of patterns of syntactic categories in Assamese question sentences. We have also worked on extracting the Bi-grams and Tri-grams of these patterns so that analysis and processing can be done on more basic level. In this paper, we have tried to focus on extraction of PoS tag based Assamese question patterns. We also have tried to generate the Bi-grams and Tri-grams with their frequencies of occurrences throughout the patterns. The work is a noval attempt in modeling question sentence patterns with the embedded PoS patterns."}]}]}]}}
