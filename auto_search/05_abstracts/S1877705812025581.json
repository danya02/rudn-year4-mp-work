The vehicle will be able to navigate itself automatically to the desired destination. Besides auto-navigation, the two vehicles will also have the capability to avoid collisions with each other using wireless communication via Zigbee. For auto-navigation, the vehicle will move a certain distance forward and calculate its latitude, longitude and its bearing values with relative to the destination point. For the collision avoidance, each vehicle will be equipped with the XBee 802.15.4 transceiver whereby they will transmit and receive their current position and predict whether both of them will collide or not along the way. The experimental results showed that the vehicles are able to auto-navigate to the intended location within a destination position arriving tolerance of \u00b15m radius range. The Zigbee wireless communication is also successfully implemented and was able to transmit and receive data at long distances (45 m for non-light of sight and 60m for line of sight)."}]}]}]}}
