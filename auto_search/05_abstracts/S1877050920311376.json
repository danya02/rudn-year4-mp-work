To attain this, IEEE802.11p standard is developed with Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) contention-based priority-oriented medium access method. In this method, the backoff algorithm selects the Contention Window (CW) size randomly from the range (0, CW). The lower bound for this range is always fixed as zero, irrespective of the backoff stages and congestion in the network. This causes the backoff procedure to select the smaller value even when the network is heavily congested thus increasing collisions and congestion. To resolve this unbalanced backoff interval problem, this paper proposes a Channel Status based Contention Algorithm (CSCA) which regulates the backoff interval based on the number of retransmission attempts by packets and vehicle density for the non-safety applications. The network simulation is carried out using NS3 along with SUMO for highway traffic and results are shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the default EDCA and Adaptive EDCA (A-EDCA) methods in terms of packet collision rate, throughput and delay."}]}]}]}}
