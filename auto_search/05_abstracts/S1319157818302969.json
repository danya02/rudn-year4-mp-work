A meticulous investigation is necessitated to implement the sensor nodes in an appropriate topology at optimum node-mobility in ZigBee incorporated WSN networks to offer optimum Quality of Services (QoS). Subsequently, an attempt to compute the comprehensive recital of a non-beacon mode based 802.15.4/ZigBee integrated WSN network is demonstrated. An analytical model is designed using parameters such as back-off number, retransmission limit, and back-off exponent considering the impact of node-mobility which has not reported earlier. Further, the investigation is carried out experimentally by evaluating the different QoS metrics, for instance, throughput, network load, bit error rate (BER), received power, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and end-to-end delay for diverse node-density and network-size of a mobile Wireless Sensor Network. Based on the measurements obtained, the authors recommend implementing the mobile sensor nodes in a cluster-tree fashion to afford the best possible QoS services."}]}]}]}}
