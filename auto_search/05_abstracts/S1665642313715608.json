This paper describes a novel wireless multi-hop multicast flow control scheme for wireless mesh networks via 802.11, which is based on the distributed self-turning Optimal Proportional plus Second-order Differential (OPSD) controller. The control scheme, which is located at the sources in the wireless multicast networks, can ensure short convergence time by regulating the transmission rate. We further analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of fast response time, low packet loss and error ration."}]}]}]}}
