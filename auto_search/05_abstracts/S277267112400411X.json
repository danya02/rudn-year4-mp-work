A CPS combines physical components, computational elements, and communication networks. The smart grid CPS (SG-CPS) is an example of such a system, featuring physical devices with diverse communication needs and intermediary networks. Consequently, robust and secure communication networks are essential for optimal performance of the SG-CPS. This paper provides an overview of current technologies in SG-CPS, its implementation, benefits, and security issues. Our goal is to summarize the latest advancements, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and encourage further exploration into this rapidly growing field."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e943", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e944"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e946", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e947", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e949"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e950"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e953", "view": "all"}, "_": "Examination of SG-CPS architecture including communication and technologies."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e955"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e958", "view": "all"}, "_": "Analyzes various operational scenarios for smart grid communication systems"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e960"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e963", "view": "all"}, "_": "Identifies key challenges in smart grid communications and proposes potential solutions to address them."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e965"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e968", "view": "all"}, "_": "Assesses the strengths, weaknesses, and solutions for diverse communication technologies applied to SG systems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e970"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e973", "view": "all"}, "_": "Explores potential research avenues for LTE and 5G-NR cellular networks in the context of smart grid communications."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
