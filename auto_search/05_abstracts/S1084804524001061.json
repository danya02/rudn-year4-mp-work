Routing protocols requiring design or validation can easily be modeled using this approach. To date, however, existing research on routing algebras has mainly focused on applying this approach to routing protocols that are generally used in networks which have a single addressing and forwarding protocol. The basic algebraic structures used in such contexts are semirings, Sobrinho\u2019s algebras and algebras of endomorphisms. In this paper, we propose the modification of these existing routing algebras to deal with networks that contain multiple forwarding protocols where tunnels are omnipresent. To achieve this, we define new algebraic structures derived from the three aforementioned ones, in order to model the generalized routing problem with automatic tunneling entitled "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "valid paths"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " algebra.
