This paper investigates an optimal cross-layer joint routing and scheduling problem for WSN with periodic data collection. The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model such that a joint scheduling and routing is developed to maximize network lifetime and minimize delay. In this paper, an ILP model with multi objective cost function is proposed. The proposed ILP model represents the operation of Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-Based (EEDS) protocol. The ILP model is solved for different network configurations. The optimal solutions assuming different objectives are compared."}]}]}]}}
