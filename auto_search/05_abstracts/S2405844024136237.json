However, more research is needed to understand their roles in immune modulation. This study revealed that 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NSDHL) expression was elevated in cholangiocarcinoma. In vitro experiments demonstrated that NSDHL had no effect on the growth or invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells in an artificial laboratory environment. However, NSDHL overexpression strongly enhanced the promotion of AKT/YAP-driven cholangiocarcinoma. NSDHL bound to STING and facilitated its degradation via ubiquitination. This inhibited the cyclic-GMP-AMP-synthase-STING signaling pathway and reduced the synthesis of IFN\u03b2. A study revealed an inverse relationship between the expression of NSDHL and the infiltration of NK cells, activated CD4"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "+"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " T cells, and neutrophils in individuals who were diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. This study elucidates the role of NSDHL, in addition to its established metabolic functions, NSDHL regulates the cyclic-GMP-AMP-synthase signaling pathway. By exploring this interplay, this research enriches our understanding of the functions of NSDHL in terms of cellular dynamics, offering novel insights into the modulation of crucial biological pathways."}]}]}]}]}}
