This allows for non-patent experts to search for climate change-related technologies in a more user-friendly fashion. The scheme has been continually expanded in recent years and is now considered complete for CCMTs, covering seven main categories, namely energy, greenhouse gases (GHG) capture, buildings, industry (including agriculture), transport and waste and wastewater management. A classification scheme for smart grids, Y04S (a spin-off of Y02), has been also developed. Both classifications ease the access to patent documentation in sustainable technologies. An overview of the structure of the Y02/Y04S scheme is presented together with examples of how this can be used (i) to find relevant technologies and their owners and (ii) to provide technical, legal and business information to support strategic decision-making in the field of climate change."}]}]}]}}
