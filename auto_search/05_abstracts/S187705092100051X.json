This can be provided by massively parallel computer (MPC) systems. A sensitive step of maintaining such systems is the interconnection network used to interconnect the computing nodes. The topology used effects the network costs and performance significantly. Hierarchal interconnection networks (HIN) were introduced having several attractive features including low latency, low cost, and high fault tolerance. This paper proposes a new HIN called Midimew connect Torus Network (MTN) that provides constant node degree, high arc connectivity, high fault tolerance and a reasonable bisection width. Static network performance evaluation for the proposed MTN has been conducted and compared with other networks. The comparison included conventional topologies such as 2D Mesh and 2D Torus and hierarchal ones which are TESH and TTN. The comparison of result shows that with the cost of extra communication links MTN attains higher fault tolerance than that of TESH and mesh networks, and equal to that of TTN, and less than that of torus network. Also, the hierarchical networks such as MTN, TTN, and TESH yield moderate bisection width; and the bisection width of MTN is lower than that of mesh and torus networks. This paper shows the superiority of the proposed MTN by comparative study of static network performance."}]}]}]}}
