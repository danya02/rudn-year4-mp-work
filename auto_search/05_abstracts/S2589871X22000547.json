In this study, a scientometric approach has been applied to fibres as an evidence type using information contained in Scopus and Web of Science. A comparison was also made with the references listed in the INTERPOL International Forensic Science Managers Symposium Science (IFSMS) reports (2004\u20132019) where only a limited number of documents were common with the citation databases, illustrating the value of the IFSMS reports. Finally, this study also highlights that data availability and location are generally omitted in publications. The forensic science community has an opportunity to change this culture and lead the way in making their data available, aligning with the ideals of fairness, openness and transparency of the underpinning data upon which scientific developments are based."}]}]}]}}
