The integration of two types of smart meters (SM) are developed: (i) consumer owned SM and (ii) distributor owned SM. The consumer owned SM runs over a wireless platform\u2013ZigBee protocol and the distributor owned SM uses the wired environment\u2013ModBus protocol. The SM are connected to a SCADA system (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) that supervises a network of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The SCADA system/PLC network integrates different types of information coming from several technologies present in modern buildings."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp000065", "view": "all"}, "_": "The developed control strategy implements a hierarchical cascade controller where inner loops are performed by local PLCs, and the outer loop is managed by a centralized SCADA system, which interacts with the entire local PLC network."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp000070", "view": "all"}, "_": "In order to implement advanced controllers, a communication channel was developed to allow the communication between the SCADA system and the MATLAB software."}]}]}]}}
