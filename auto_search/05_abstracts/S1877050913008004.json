The paper introduces a re-provisioning mechanism with partial re-routing capabilities to lower the Co2 emission rate while it provides the most available routes between any pair of source and destination. The paper provides a thorough analysis of adaptive green routing mechanism by establishing a partial re-provisioning environment to analyze how the re-provisioning level can affect Co2 emission level, blocking rate, and resource allocation."}]}]}]}}
