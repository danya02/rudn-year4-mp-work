Rapidly growing urban development brings a lot of uncertainty for deciding on the appropriate location of a new establishment, as one should consider a number of complex non-linear factors. In general, existing approaches rely on the manually obtained data from surveys and reports or indirect location-based data, which do not represent the real spending patterns of customers. By using data from debit card transactions, we bring a new perspective to this problem, since this information directly reflects the facts and amounts of purchases for this area. In this study, we test different graph neural network (GNN) architectures to find the best model for customer flow prediction."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spara0045", "view": "all"}, "_": "First, we gather data and features, based on which we will make a prediction. After that we build a general architecture for a model, that would allow us to test it with different types of GNN, different number of layers and neighbour order. After running tests with various parameters best performance was achieved with GCN-layer. The evaluation of the trained model shows that the R2 coefficient is 0.835. We also provide additional analysis of prediction quality for each financial category separately."}]}]}]}}
