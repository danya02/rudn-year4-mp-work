To guide user to the right cluster of documents, cluster labels should be meaningful and correctly representing the clusters. However significant a cluster is, if the label is not proper, user will never select it. In this paper, we present a method to label clusters based on their linking information. Our cluster labeling method is independent of any clustering method but restricted to only search result documents. We use heuristic search method to find all the linked documents of a cluster. If all or some documents of a cluster share hyperlinks, then we deduce label from these linked documents\u2019 titles using famous Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining. This removes the requirement of reviewing other members of a cluster in labeling process."}]}]}]}}
