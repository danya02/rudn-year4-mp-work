The included data describe the topology of the network testbed and the obtained results. Obtained data show the effectiveness of the proposed model in comparison with the MAM and RDM bandwidth allocation models. In relation to the performances evaluation, a variety of flows are used such as: voice over IP (VoIP), video, HTTP, and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The evaluation criteria are: VoIP latency and jitter, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) video, retransmission video, goodput, HTTP response page, and the Round-Trip Time (RTT) ICMP delay. The presented data are extracted based on simulation."}]}]}]}}
