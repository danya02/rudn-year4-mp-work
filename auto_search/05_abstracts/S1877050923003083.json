This is mainly due to its capability for providing accurate predictions and reliable consistency in decision-making. Bridge engineering focused on structure monitoring and inspection is a crucial activity for disaster prevention. Therefore, it is an application field wherein synergies between professional knowledge and sophisticated machine-based analytics strategies can be established and even drive time-effective interventions. This paper presents a comparison of DL models used to detect defects in bridges, resorting to the following architectures: MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, Visual Geometry Group Network-16 (VGG16), and InceptionResNetV2. Different optimizers (e.g., Nadam, Adam, RMSprop, and SGD) crossed with distinct learning rates (e.g., 1, 10"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "\u22121"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", 10"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "\u22122"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", 10"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "\u22123"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", 10"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "\u22124"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", and 10"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "\u22125"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") were employed. VGG16, Xception, and NASNetMobile showed the most stable learning curves. Moreover, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) overlapping images clarifies that InceptionResNetV2 and InceptionV3 models seek features outside the areas of interest (defects). Comparing optimizers\u2019 performance, the adaptive ones outperform SGD with decay schedulers for learning rates."}]}]}]}]}}
