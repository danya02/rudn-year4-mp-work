Whilst there are numerous ways that communications can be hidden from an adversary the approach used in this paper is to minimise the transmitted power of the network's radios, whilst keeping the radios connected. Results from previous simulation experiments demonstrated the potential efficacy of these algorithms. In this paper we have implemented these algorithms into mobile radios and performed field trials to determine whether the LPD algorithm would transfer over into a more realistic environment. Problems associated with the noisy wireless medium were overcome and promising results obtained. This paper describes the field trials of the LPD algorithm, discusses some emerging issues, and presents the results from these trials."}]}]}]}}
