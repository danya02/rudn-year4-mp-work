The first dataset is a complete set of GNSS-R (GNSS-R: Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 Reflectometry) airborne data. This dataset has been generated with the data acquired with the GLObal Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry Instrument (GLORI) developed at Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la Biosph\u00e8re (CESBIO), during the Land surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment (LIAISE) campaign in north-eastern Spain during the summer of 2021. It is the first time to our knowledge that a complete dataset of GNSS-R observables (reflectivity, incoherent component relative to the total scattering signal to noise ratio (SNR) for copolarized (right-right) and cross-polarized (right-left) measurements has been made available."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spara017", "view": "all"}, "_": "The two other datasets are ground truth sets of measurements which have been acquired simultaneously with the flights.
