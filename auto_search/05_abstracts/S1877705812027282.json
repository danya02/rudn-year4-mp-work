Several wireless e-Nose node sensor prototypes have been developed by some research institutions. Currently wireless e-Nose sensor networks are used in various research activities as well as industrial applications such as odour monitoring, gas monitoring, air quality monitoring, etc. The goal of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art of the wireless e-Nose sensor network technology and the future trend in wireless e-Nose sensor node development. This relatively novel technology offers promising advantage in many fields such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, medicine and cold chain control or traceability. Investigations and reviews pertaining to core processing, radio communication, power supply, sensing component, and dimension are presented."}]}]}]}}
