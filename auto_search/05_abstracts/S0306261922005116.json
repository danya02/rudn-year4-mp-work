This method is distinct from previously reported methods which utilise a conventional anode\u2013cathode arrangement in open seawater to create a voltage cell. The underlying theory, modelling, and experimental results are described for implementation on a real application, namely annulus monitoring in a subsea production well. A broad range of new applications is envisaged, including self-powered and lifetime monitoring of safety critical parameters on marine structures, including wind turbines."}]}]}]}}
