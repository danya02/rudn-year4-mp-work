One of the primary challenges for LSN systems with inter-satellite links is the routing strategy calculation and maintenance, due to LSN constellation scale and dynamic network topology feature. In order to seek an efficient routing strategy, a Q-learning-based dynamic distributed Routing scheme for LSNs (QRLSN) is proposed in this paper. To achieve low end-to-end delay and low network traffic overhead load in LSNs, QRLSN adopts a multi-objective optimization method to find the optimal next hop for forwarding data packets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively discover the initial routing strategy and provide long-term Quality of Service (QoS) optimization during the routing maintenance process. In addition, comparison results demonstrate that QRLSN is superior to the virtual-topology-based shortest path routing algorithm."}]}]}]}}
