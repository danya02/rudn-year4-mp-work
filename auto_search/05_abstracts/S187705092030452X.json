We are concerned in this paper to understand how to increase system-level resilience, specifically in smart homes in light of increasing technological heterogeneity and path diversity and the increasing likelihood that security measures will be circumvented. Our approach involves simulating and modeling the interaction of diverse smart home technologies in the context of their relationship to the core internet. We show how technological diversity can be incorporated into system design in ways that can increase resilience."}]}]}]}}
