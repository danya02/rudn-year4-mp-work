The sensor node has limited capabilities, especially for energy reserve and memory storage, that is why topology and routing protocols should be defined for a good network's performances. In this paper, we focus on Zigbee sensor networks based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard for which we improve the topology control by proposing an efficient clustering topology based on Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). In fact, our proposed algorithm tend to propose a topology where the cost of total transmissions into the network should be minimal. Our topology takes also into consideration the indoor environment by proposing a metric that deal with the path loss and signal attenuation due to walls and obstacles to compute the weight of connections between nodes. Finally, our topology showed better results than typical Cluster-tree and mesh topology generally used in Zigbee sensor networks in terms of energy consumption and network's lifetime."}]}]}]}}
