However, routing mechanisms which only consider service level specifications as the path selection criteria may not be aware of energy consumption and Co2 emission rate of the routed paths. This can generate huge Co2 emissions and consume energy inefficiently. This paper introduces a hybrid green SLA-based routing approach to lower the Co2 emission rate while it provides the most available routes between any pair of source and destination. A new hybrid path cost function is also proposed in which Co2 emission rate, path length, and path availability are taken into account as the route selection process criteria. As a result of employing the new energy-aware routing algorithm together with the novel path cost function, paths with the minimum Co2 emission and less assigned network resources will be selected while service level agreement requirements are still met."}]}]}]}}
