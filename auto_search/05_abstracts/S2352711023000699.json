From event data that capture historical process executions, process discovery algorithms learn a process model describing the execution of the various activities involved. Such discovered models are crucial artifacts used by many process mining techniques. Most existing process discovery approaches can be classified as conventional\u2014they function like a black-box approach and often learn models of poor quality from event data. Cortado is a software tool dedicated to interactive process discovery that lets users gradually learn process models from event data. Cortado leverages domain knowledge and insights extracted from data to develop process models in an interactive manner gradually. We describe Cortado\u2019s architecture and functionalities that contribute to the overall goal of interactive process discovery."}]}]}]}}
