A robust destabilizing effect was observed in the millimolar concentration range in the case of spermine, spermidine as well as putrescine, which was strongly pH and salt concentration-dependent, and remained significant also at neutral pH. The integrity of genomic DNA was not affected by PA treatment, excluding DNA break-elicited topological relaxation as a factor in destabilization. The binding of PAs to DNA was demonstrated by the displacement of ethidium bromide, both from deproteinized nuclear halos and from plasmid DNA. The possibility that DNA methylation patterns may be influenced by PA levels is contemplated in the context of gene expression and DNA methylation correlations identified in the NCI-60 panel-based CellMiner database: methylated loci in subsets of high-ODC1 cell lines and the dependence of PER3 DNA methylation on PA metabolism."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Robust, pH and salt concentration-dependent nucleosome destabilizing effect of polyamines."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Destabilizing effect is independent of changes of DNA superhelicity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Genes exhibiting aberrant DNA methylation patterns correlating with increased polyamine synthesis identified in the CellMiner database."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "These include the circadian regulatory gene PER3 and certain histone genes."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
