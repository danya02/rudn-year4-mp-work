They collect data from different environment or infrastructures in order to send them to the cloud using different communications platforms. These data can be used to provide smarter services. However, they are various issues and challenges related to the ubiquitous sensors that should be solved. In this paper we interest on analysis of wireless sensor network from an energy management perspective. The idea behind the energy-efficiency wireless sensor networks is that each node can only transmit to a limited number of other nodes directly. The limited resources of nodes imply that the transmission range is limited. In order to transfer the data to the final destination, the traffic must be relayed using intermediate nodes, creating a multi-hop route. The total energy consumption associated with an end-to-end transmission over such a route can be significantly reduced if the nodes are correctly configured. In this paper, underground mine monitoring system is presented with an overview of the related issues and challenges such as reliability, cost, and scalability."}]}]}]}}
