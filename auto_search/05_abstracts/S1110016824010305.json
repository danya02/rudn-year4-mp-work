Previous methods often struggled with high latency, limited scalability, and inadequate risk management, and to address these issues, the experimental platform includes traditional centralized systems, distributed systems, blockchain-based systems, and edge computing + blockchain systems. By monitoring indicators such as data processing delay, data transmission delay, data retrieval time, system throughput, and data integrity of each platform, and introducing evaluation formulas for credit risk, operational risk, and market risk, the performance of different systems in processing supply chain financial data is comprehensively analyzed. The experimental results show that the edge computing + blockchain system performs well in data processing efficiency, security, real-time, and system throughput, especially under high load conditions. Our market risk value is reduced to 0.015. This framework improves the efficiency and security of data transmission and effectively reduces credit risk and operational risk, providing an efficient and reliable solution for data management in supply chain finance."}]}]}]}}
