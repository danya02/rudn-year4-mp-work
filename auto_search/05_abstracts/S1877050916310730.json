WMNs comprises of Gateways (GWs), Mesh Clients (MCs) and Mesh Routers (MRs). However, it is challenging job to provide seamless connectivity when MC moves around the network. The recent advances in the field of wireless technology created a chance to overwhelmed the disadvantages of wired and wireless networks. The mobility management in the WMNs motivated the researchers to concentrate. In this paper, we are proposing a model called as multi-layer routing protocol for WMNs. This protocol works with the data link layer and network layer for data frame transmission. The proposed algorithm is implemented with intra domain for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the routing protocol."}]}]}]}}
