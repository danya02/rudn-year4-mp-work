However, this paradigm shift has raised several security concerns, particularly safeguarding private information stored on faraway cloud servers. This study proposes a ground-breaking hybrid cryptographic framework for the secure data storage requirements of cloud computing. The framework incorporates time-limited access control, adaptive key management, and two strong encryption methods: RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard - One Time Password (AES-OTP). AES-OTP and RSA provide symmetric and asymmetric encryption levels to improve data confidentiality and integrity. With the introduction of an intelligent framework for key creation, distribution, and rotation through the adaptive key management component, the security of cryptographic operations is gradually increased. Additionally, time-limited access control helps to protect data privacy by imposing rigorous temporal constraints on data access and reducing security flaws. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is confirmed by thorough performance assessments, which show astonishing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values of 99.12%, 98.78%, 98.11%, and 98.56%. This demonstrates its outstanding skills in protecting private information from unauthorized access and guaranteeing its secrecy in cloud storage settings."}]}]}]}}
