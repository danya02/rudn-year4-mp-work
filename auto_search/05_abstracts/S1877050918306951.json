Now it has been extensively used at the internet platforms and implied a lot of valuable information. In view of the semi-structured data implication rules, the paper discussed a method of extracting the semi-structured data implication rules, and designed the genetic algorithm SDIR of the semi-structured data implication rules based on the method of data conversion and genetic algorithm. Using network crawler tools to complete the semi-structured data collection and data conversion, the experiment verifies it\u2019s effective in implication rules by crawling the data of \u201cDianping.com\u201d."}]}]}]}}
