The previous research mainly focused on lexical n-grams. Nevertheless, n-grams of other linguistic features, such as part-of-speech, have been less studied. The current study is expected to examine whether n-grams of part-of-speech tags extracted from a large corpus can be a discriminator of different genres. The results show that a strong correlation exists between the information about n-grams of part-of-speech tags and the genre of the text."}]}]}]}}
