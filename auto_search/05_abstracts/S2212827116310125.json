In addition to it, requirements of multiple standards are needed to be met during the entire product life cycle. There is a need of clear and thorough definition of requirements vis-\u00e0-vis design of port hoisting equipment, and at each life cycle stage, development activities are to be carried out. This paper discusses the classification of the requirement information of the hoisting equipment and defines the requirement features as well. This study also establishes requirement information model for port hoisting equipment by SysML and elaborates the requirement information within relationship by means of an example."}]}]}]}}
