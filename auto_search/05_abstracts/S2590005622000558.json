Vulnerability assessment for such complex systems are challenging, partly due to the discrepancy among mechanisms used to evaluate their cyber-security weakness levels. Several sources do report these weaknesses like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), as well as manufacturer websites besides other security scanning advisories such as Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) and Shodan databases. However, these multiple sources are found to face inconsistency issues, especially in terms of vulnerability severity scores. We advocate an artificial intelligence based approach to streamline the computation of vulnerability severity magnitudes. This approach decreases the error rate induced by manual calculation processes, that are traditionally used in cybersecurity analysis. Popular repositories such as NVD and SecurityFocus are employed to validate the proposed approach, assisted with a query method to retrieve vulnerability instances. In doing so, we report discovered correlations among reported vulnerability scores to infer consistent magnitude values of vulnerability instances. The method is applied to a case study featuring a CPS application to illustrate the automation of the proposed vulnerability scoring mechanism, used to mitigate cybersecurity weaknesses."}]}]}]}}
