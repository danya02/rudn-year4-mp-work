Within a short period, 30\u00a0billion intelligent devices in the form of smart applications will get connected to make an individual's life smoother, more comfortable, faster and accessible from anywhere at any time. IoT combines the power of IPv6 for network connectivity, sensing and nextgen communication technologies to meet future demands. Due to constraint environment in terms of memory, computation, and energy, this review paper will provide in-depth analysis of different OS'es. Candidate OS and Simulator is selected, keeping in mind various barriers and critical design characteristics. By doing this survey, it is possible for other research communities to make an appropriate choice for OS and making IoT a reality. Finally, the case study is also discussed which provides protocol stack implementation details along with deployable testbed, its size in terms of nodes supported and other security challenges. Critical preference level in terms of programming language and application areas from a developer perspective is also analysed and discussed to provide further research direction. IoT integration with future domains, along with various challenges, is explored at the end."}]}]}]}}
