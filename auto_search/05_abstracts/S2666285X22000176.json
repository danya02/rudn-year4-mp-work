Thus, a recommendation system comes in handy to deal with this large volume of data and filter out the useful information which is fast and relevant to the user's choice. This paper describes an approach to a movie recommendation system using Cosine Similarity to recommend similar movies based on the one chosen by the user. Although the existing recommendation systems get the job done, it does not justify if the movie is worth spending time on. To enhance the user experience, this system performs sentiment analysis on the reviews of the movie chosen using machine learning. Two of the supervised machine learning algorithms Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier are used to increase the accuracy and efficiency. This paper also gives a comparison between NB and SVM on the basis of parameters like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score. The accuracy score of SVM came out to be 98.63% whereas accuracy score of NB is 97.33%. Thus, SVM outweighs NB and proves to be a better fit for Sentiment Analysis."}]}]}]}}
