In this technical report, we identify pitfalls in IPFS, and demonstrate proof-of-concept using a 3-layer architecture for scalable, decentralized storage, and access. Optimized through dedicated gateways and CDNs, which can be effectively applied to all medical data and imaging modalities across the healthcare sector. DLT and off-chain network solutions present numerous opportunities for advancements in clinical care, education, and research. Such approaches uphold the principles of equitable healthcare data ownership, security, and democratization, and are poised to drive significant innovation."}]}]}]}}
