Decomposition of binary functions is widely used during LUT-based FPGA technology mapping. However, the range of applications of functional decomposition might be wider when multiple-valued functions are considered. In this paper, DECOLib: a Java library for functional decompositions of discrete functions is presented. The library is based on blanket algebra and provides data structures and functions, which allow building the decomposition algorithms for binary/multiple-valued functions. Examples demonstrating applications of these algorithms, as well as suggestions for further research directions, are also presented."}]}]}]}}
