The replication without coordination semantics of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) makes them a natural solution for these execution contexts. However, the current CRDT models require each replica to know all other replicas beforehand or to discover them on-the-fly. Such solutions are not compatible with the dynamic ingress and egress of nodes in volatile environments. To cope with this limitation, we propose the Publish/Subscribe Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (PS-CRDT) model that combines CRDTs with the publish/subscribe interaction model, and, with that, enable the spatial and temporal decoupling of update propagation. We implemented PS-CRDTs in "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Thyme"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", a reactive storage system for mobile edge computing.
