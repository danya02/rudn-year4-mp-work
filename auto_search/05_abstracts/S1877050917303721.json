Design the system's software and hardware platform solutions, surveillance terminal use RTP protocol to receive H.264 video stream through wireless network. The method of how to deal with the disorder and loss of video packets when the unstable network is proposed. With the help of open source f.f.m. peg library for decoding and displaying the scene of surveillance. The experiments show that surveillance terminal has flexible portable features, for QCIF resolution has better real-time surveillance result."}]}]}]}}
