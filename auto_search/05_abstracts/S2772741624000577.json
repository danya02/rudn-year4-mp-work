The study advocates for the integration of disaster resilience principles into the Smart Cities Mission of India, placing particular emphasis on the necessity of developing infrastructure, establishing early warning systems, and fostering community engagement to bolster urban resilience. Furthermore, the paper draws comparisons and parallels between the components of smart cities, mitigation strategies, and disaster resilience, illuminating their interconnectedness and potential synergies. In conclusion, the study recommends the incorporation of essential network elements to establish a Smart Cities Mission that is resilient to disasters, ultimately aiming to safeguard urban communities from the adverse impacts of future calamities."}]}]}]}}
