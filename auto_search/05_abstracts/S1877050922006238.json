In order to achieve the full potential of modern technologies, it is critical to ensure the critical data finds the optimum path at the right time in a highly aggressive environment employing secure and best possible available communication path or network resources. Moreover, Contextual information aware optimal communication, such as the power of the radios, battery level, distance among the radios, and maximum and minimum data rates of the radio aware optimal path selection, remains an unresolvable research area. The mentioned limitation engenders various complex challenges in mission-critical networks. Therefore, contextual information-aware optimal communication in radio networks is a priority demand raised as a primary objective for military communication research. In this paper, we have performed a comprehensive review of various proposed methodologies to achieve the objective, followed by a critical comparative analysis to anticipate the state of the mentioned research area that leads to a future research direction for military researchers."}]}]}]}}
