Actually, part of the information are correlated with some events which may be local ones such as accident, protests or natural disasters to widely ones such as events concerning well-known people or political affairs. Our research interest is to detect the location where some events are occurring by analyzing only data from weibo information. In this paper, we de- note three kind of location for each weibo: (1) content-based location; (2) posting location; (3) registration location of author of weibo. There are two main contributions in our work: (a) detect event-aware location of each weibo; (b) estimate accurate event location based on sets of event-aware locations. In order to detect event-aware location, we model there kinds of location data of each weibo to tackle with detection challenge. After we obtained a set of event-aware locations, we use a hierarchical clustering to estimate the accurate event location. The result showed that our method could improve the accuracy of event location estimation."}]}]}]}}
