In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on wireless sensor networks. The proposed system is composed of two main components: a wireless sensor network and an intelligent home gateway. Wireless sensors are used for sensing and transmitting electricity data and remote monitoring and control of home appliances are provided to users through the intelligent home gateway. The system enables users to save energy by monitoring and controlling home appliances through web and mobile devices."}]}]}]}}
