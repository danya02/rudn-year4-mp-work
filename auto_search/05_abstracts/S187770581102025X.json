We propose a new security localization algorithm TVSL (Threshold and Vote Security Localization) for wireless sensor network (WSN). This algorithm improves the safety performance of positioning process of nodes in WSN by using the threshold idea and vote with sensor nodes. The advantage of this algorithm is that no additional hardware is needed, easy integration with other localization algorithms, and the safety performance of localization algorithm is improved obviously. From the simulation of this algorithm, we get the expected results."}]}]}]}}
