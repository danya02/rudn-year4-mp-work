In particular, it makes possible real-time monitoring and analysis in smart factories using commodity hardware and open-source software. The system collects data from distributed wireless receivers, aggregates the data in spatial cells and time bins, and computes space-time wireless metric data frames. A prototype monitoring system was implemented with two types of wireless interface sensors, packet-capture and spectral sensors, and automatic online data collection, indexing, aggregation and analysis. The prototype system reports wireless quality metrics with one-meter spatial resolution and periodic update times of 1 to 10 seconds."}]}]}]}}
