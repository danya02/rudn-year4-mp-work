We propose in this paper, a new statistical approach for extracting inter-language clusters from multilingual documents based on Closed Concepts Mining and vector model. Formal Concept Analysis techniques are applied to extract Closed Concepts from comparable corpora; and, then, exploit these Closed Concepts and vector models in the clustering and alignment of multilin- gual documents. An experimental evaluation is conducted on the collection of bilingual documents French-English of CLEF\u20192003. The results confirmed that the synergy between Formal Concept Analysis and vector model is fruitful to extract bilingual classes of documents, with an interesting comparability score."}]}]}]}}
