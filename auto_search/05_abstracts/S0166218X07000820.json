Intuitively, our results correspond to synthesizing alternative, more economical, interconnection networks by reducing the number of dimensions and/or link density of existing networks via mapping and pruning. We discuss applications of these results to well-known and useful interconnection networks such as hexagonal and honeycomb meshes, including the derivation of provably correct shortest-path routing algorithms for such networks."}]}]}]}}
