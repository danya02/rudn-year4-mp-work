Sensor nodes deployed nearby the sink node need to convey extra data and control packets, thus undergo much quicker energy depletion rates and therefore have considerably smaller estimated lifespan of network. In the paper, we have analyzed the proficiency of AODV, DSR and TORA protocols in presence of energy holes problem in a wireless sensor network. Throughput, average energy consumption, end to end delay, work efficiency, packet delivery ratio, packet drop rate, nodes alive and routing overhead of each protocol have been demonstrated under different node density. The usefulness of some prevailing approaches towards extenuating this problem has been carried out and simulation results are used to confirm the analysis. It is observed that AODV and DSR protocol outperform TORA in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio whereas in case of Work efficiency AODV outperforms DSR and TORA protocol. AODV has a smaller amount of end to end delay and average energy consumption as equated to DSR and TORA protocols while Packet drop rate is least in TORA protocol. Routing overhead is lesser in DSR protocol as compared to AODV and TORA. Number of alive nodes in DSR protocol is greater as compared to AODV and TORA."}]}]}]}}
