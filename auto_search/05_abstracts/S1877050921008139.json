Keywords help to filter and find interesting information for users from massive text. Automatic extraction of keywords from text as tags of text help to improve recommendation and keyword-based information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel keyword extraction approach from text that combines features such as word frequency and association. Experiment results show that the precision rate, recall rate and F-measure are all better than those of TextRank and TF-IDF."}]}]}]}}
