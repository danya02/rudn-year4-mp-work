Automatic extraction of such patterns benefits several downstream tasks, including, entity extraction, ontology building, and question answering. Unfortunately, automatic extraction of such patterns has not yet received much attention from NLP and information retrieval researchers. In this work, we propose an attention-based supervised deep learning model, "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "ASPER"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", which extracts syntactic patterns between entities exhibiting a given semantic relation in the sentential context.
