With the help of a heuristic of systems theory two subsystems of society \u2013 science and mass media \u2013 are compared with respect to communications about climate change over the last 20 years. With text mining methods metadata of documents from two databases \u2013 OpenAlex and Wikipedia \u2013 are generated, analyzed, and visualized. We find substantial differences as well as similarities in the social, factual, and temporal dimensions. While Wikipedia shows a much greater variety of concrete organizations, social movements, media outlets, and persons, science is more concerned with abstract interrelations of human action. In both systems, there is a shift in attention from describing the very phenomenon to questioning how to deal with this fact. This demonstrates for science a discursive shift from causes to consequences and for mass media a shift from chat to crisis. Science shows an ongoing growth process, while the attention of mass media appears cyclical."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0065", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Scientific communications about climate change increase exponentially."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Wikipedia attention to climate change in the last 20 years appears cyclical."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Science discourse shifts from causes to consequences."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Wikipedia discourse shifts from chat to crisis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Substantial differences in climate change debates in science and mass media."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
