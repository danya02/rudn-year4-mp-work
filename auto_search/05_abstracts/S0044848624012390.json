In addition, it is expected that temperature variability due to more intense and frequent winter storms will increase with climate change, and this may further threaten Atlantic salmon health and welfare in sea-cages. To better understand cage-site conditions and aspects of salmon behaviour and physiology during the winter, we fitted Atlantic salmon in commercial size sea-cages in Newfoundland (Canada) for two consecutive years with internal and external data storage tags (DSTs) that recorded depth, temperature, heart rate ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "f"}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "H"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") and 3D-acceleration (swimming activity). Tags were surgically attached / implanted in late October / early November when water temperatures were 8\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C, and the DSTs were collected at the time of harvest.
