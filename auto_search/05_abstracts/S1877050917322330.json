Each sensor node can transmit monitoring data to the cloud. Data mining techniques were used with the purpose of identifying behavioral patterns given the environment conditions captured by the sensor network. The operationalization of this research was taken as a case study within the rose greenhouses available to Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas \u2013 ESPE, Ecuador."}]}]}]}}
