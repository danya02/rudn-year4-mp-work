In particular, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), that are formed without any centralized infrastructure, have received a lot of attention as they can be used in many real life applications. Yet, compared to static wireless networks, less academic research has been done on MANETs, especially when all the nodes are in continuous movement. In particular, we consider MANETs that broadcast HELLO messages at regular time intervals in order to maintain dynamic neigh- borhood information. The range of velocities of the nodes and the HELLO message interval duration can significantly affect the performance of routing protocols in MANETs. In this work, we study the effect of varying these two main characteristics on the performance of MANETs in terms of delivered packets and packets delivery ratio that reflect routing paths stability. We present a comprehensive experimental analysis of the effect of such variations on three position-based stability-oriented routing protocols, namely, Greedy-based Backup Routing (GBR), LEARN-based Backup Routing (LBR), and GBR combined with a Conservative Neighborhood Range (GBR-CNR)."}]}]}]}}
