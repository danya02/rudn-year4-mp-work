While numerous classic operations research solvers ensure optimal solutions, they often struggle with real-time dynamic objectives and environments, such as dynamic routing problems, which require periodic algorithmic recalibration. To deal with dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential with its capability as a self-learning and optimizing mechanism. However, the real-world applications of reinforcement learning are relatively limited due to lengthy training time and inefficiency in high-dimensional state spaces. In this study, we introduce two methods to enhance reinforcement learning for dynamic routing optimization. The first method involves transferring knowledge from classic operations research solvers to reinforcement learning during training, which accelerates exploration and reduces lengthy training time. The second method uses a state\u2013space decomposer to transform the high-dimensional state space into a low-dimensional latent space, which allows the reinforcement learning agent to learn efficiently in the latent space. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in an industrial application of an automated welding process, where our approach identifies the shortest welding pathway of an industrial robotic arm to weld a set of dynamically changing target nodes, poses and sizes. The suggested method cuts computation time by 25% to 50% compared to classic routing algorithms."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e729", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e730"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e732", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e733", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e737", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S0736584524000991/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e738", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e739"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e741", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e742", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e744"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e745"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e748", "view": "all"}, "_": "We present a novel reinforcement learning method for solving dynamic routing problems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e750"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e753", "view": "all"}, "_": "The proposed framework, namely SSD4OR-RL, suits to mixed-integer linear programming."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e755"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e758", "view": "all"}, "_": "SSD4OR-RL allows knowledge transfer between classic algorithms and RL agents."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e760"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e763", "view": "all"}, "_": "SSD4OR-RL boosts RL in high-dimensional state spaces by decomposing them."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e765"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e768", "view": "all"}, "_": "We showcase SSD4OR-RL solving ABB industrial welding robot routing challenges."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
