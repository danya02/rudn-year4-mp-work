Secured information or maintain data confidentiality is a big challenge in today life, but main issue is which needs a security for the purpose of localization. Including to this one more complication now focused on sensation in acoustic motes which practices Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method for locality or Position Assessment. Here propose Contemporary Secured Target Locality (CSTL) algorithm mainly addresses security and target location issues, Sybil and on-off attack and wicked motes occurrence at altered stages of target locality at the end results are compared with existing method General Localization (GLS), Approximate Point in Triangle, Distance Vector hop localization and multi hop method with proposed method. Here outcome of simulation prove better accuracy and progressive reaction in attack recognition presently contributes in build a secured wireless sensor network."}]}]}]}}
