Various parameters of human health are capable of being sensed by it. The integration of medical and biosensors with wireless or wired communication networks is recognized as a key feature of smart health services. However, one of the major challenges faced by this system is the security and privacy of patient health data, which is considered vulnerable to local intruders and cyber attackers. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the security threats and privacy issues associated with different smart health systems developed by researchers is presented. A detailed discussion about the various threats that can lead to the disclosure of patient-sensitive health data from the sensor to the communication network is delved into. Additionally, an analytical summary and requirements to eliminate the threats of smart health and sensing systems are proposed. An analysis of many smart health technologies based on the sensing system that monitors patient health in real time is included in the analytical summary. Security and privacy requirements for the smart health sensing system are also recommended, with an integrated security framework being applied to ensure the robustness and efficiency of the health management and monitoring system."}]}]}]}}
