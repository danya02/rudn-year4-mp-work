Our framework packages a collection of techniques to automatically infer and generate sandboxes, specifically Linux containers, for running applications directly from their source code. This approach significantly simplifies software execution, improving developer productivity and promoting reuse. We demonstrate the framework\u2019s effectiveness through real-world examples and use cases implemented in Python, NodeJS, and Bash."}]}]}]}}
