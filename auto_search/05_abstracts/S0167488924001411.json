Although G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the targets of current antifibrotic drugs, no drug has yet been approved to stop fibrosis progression. Herein, we aimed to identify GPCRs with profibrotic effects. In gene expression analysis of mouse lungs with induced fibrosis, eight GPCRs were identified, showing a >2-fold increase in mRNA expression after fibrosis induction. Among them, we focused on Gpr176 owing to its significant correlation with a myofibroblast marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), the profibrotic factor transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21), and collagen in a human lung gene expression database. Similar to the lung fibrosis model, increased "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Gpr176"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " expression was also observed in other organs affected by fibrosis, including the kidney, liver, and heart, suggesting its role in fibrosis across various organs. Furthermore, fibroblasts abundantly expressed Gpr176 compared to alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages in the fibrotic lung. GPR176 expression was unaffected by TGF\u03b21 stimulation in rat renal fibroblast NRK-49 cells, whereas knockdown of Gpr176 by siRNA reduced TGF\u03b21-induced expression of \u03b1SMA, fibronectin, and collagen as well as Smad2 phosphorylation. This suggested that Gpr176 regulates fibroblast activation. Consequently, Gpr176 acts in a profibrotic manner, and inhibiting its activity could potentially prevent myofibroblast differentiation and improve fibrosis. Developing a GPR176 inverse agonist or allosteric modulator is a promising therapeutic approach for fibrosis."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "graphical", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0075", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0035"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"role": "short", "id": "al0040"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0035", "locator": "ga1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S0167488924001411/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0080", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Gpr176 expression is increased in various mouse models of fibrosis."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Knockdown of Gpr176 inhibits the TGF\u03b21/Smads/\u03b1SMA pathway in fibroblasts."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "GPR176 is a potential therapeutic target for organ fibrosis."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
