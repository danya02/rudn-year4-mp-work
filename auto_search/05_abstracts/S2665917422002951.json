This research focuses on low-price, extremely effective defect diagnosis methods, low-efficiency, high-cost devices to obtain timely feedback and accurate fault detection results, and secure manufacturing systems. The data structure, control plane, and output units are the three components of the manufacturing system that creates a data link between the virtual model using Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEM) devices and the Zigbee wireless transmission system in the database layer. This study acquired DT information from the control plane using the Internet of Things (IoT) through sensors for secure manufacturing information. It separates and calls the pertinent data by the attribute processor and transfers it to the outcome units. To produce the classification and outcomes of work build features information, the evaluation method analysis the output nodes that split the test set and learning group using a dynamic database. The hybrid IoT with DT technology to examine the consequences of defects detected efficiently predicted and secures the manufacturing system."}]}]}]}}
