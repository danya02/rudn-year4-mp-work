These methods can be enhanced further, if the search key can be tagged effectively and directed towards target images. In this paper, we have developed a new multilevel aggregation technique along with autoencoders, to be implemented on image features for precise feature selection and accurate search output. Locally significant datasets and generic ones are dealt separately for obtaining better hit rates along with the process of query expansion. The concept of pseudo-labelling by deep learning is introduced to classify images into positive and negative classes, where positive class consists of the images that are similar to the query image. The feature spaces of query images are compared with the images in the search pool based on their assigned weights. The target images are finally ranked and selected based on an adaptive threshold level. The methodology for this enhanced CBIR technique is tested on public datasets and its results are collated with recent approaches proposed in the literature. The proposed method has attained significant improvements in precision, recall and computation and thereby the use of images from connected devices has been proven to be significant. Given the importance of more accurate image retrieval in CBIR, this method can be experimented for other similar applications as well."}]}]}]}}
