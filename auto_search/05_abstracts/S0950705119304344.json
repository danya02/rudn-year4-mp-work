Its application lies in many different areas including sentiment analysis, Information Retrieval (IR), machine translation and knowledge graph construction. Solutions to WSD are mostly categorized into supervised and knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, a knowledge-based method is proposed, modeling the problem with semantic space and semantic path hidden behind a given sentence. The approach relies on the well-known Knowledge Base (KB) named WordNet and models the semantic space and semantic path by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and PageRank respectively. Experiments has proven the method\u2019s effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in several WSD datasets."}]}]}]}}
