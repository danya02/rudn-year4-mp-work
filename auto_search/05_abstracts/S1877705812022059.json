The aim of this protocol is minimizing the energy dissipation of the Mobile Ad-hoc network. This M-EEMC protocol is a combination of tree and mesh based routing scheme. This protocol is used to establish and maintain an active multicast tree surrounded by a passive mesh within a mobile ad hoc network. The multicast mesh is created by using route discovery concept. Pruning mechanism is used to eliminate the redundancies of mesh that is created by route discovery approach and it creates the multicast tree. M-EEMC effectively uses the knowledge of neighborhood node density and mobility so that they complement each other in discovering stable routes in a more energy-efficient fashion. Energy efficiency is achieved by eliminating most of the redundant data receptions. The proposed scheme is simulated over a large number of MANET nodes with wide range of mobility and the performance is evaluated. It is observed that proposed scheme produces better packet delivery ratio, less energy dissipation and reduced packet delay compared to on-demand multicast routing protocol (ODMRP)."}]}]}]}}
