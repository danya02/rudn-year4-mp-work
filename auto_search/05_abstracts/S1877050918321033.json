The IPv6 was introduced as the solution for addressing requirements but still, some major issues persist due to the limitations of computing devices such as power related limitations, the challenge in the deployment environments and restrictions allied to computing and memory capacity. Many new standards were proposed such as the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), the IPv6 routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) to meet the challenges. Even though RPL greatly satisfies the requirements for low-powered networks, quite a few issues remain open for enhancement, especially with respect to mobility support. This present paper examines next-generation internet protocol mobility schemes for the RPL and 6LoWPAN and analyzes how the proposed variants satisfy the necessities for low power and lossy networks."}]}]}]}}
