Pipelines allow huge amounts of refined oil products to be transported between sites. Delivery scheduling plans determine the sequences of the pumping operations. Specifically, these plans specify the types and quantities of products to be transported, the start and end times of shipments, and the routes. A scheduling plan is feasible, if its implementation is free of any obstacles. Schedules can be validated manually only in case of short time intervals (3, 4 days) and only for a moderately complex pipeline network. If the scheduling plan is longer or the pipeline network is larger, then a simulation tool is required for the validation. This work presents a novel discrete-event simulation system, which helps to validate pipeline-schedule for medium time intervals in multi-source mesh-like pipeline networks."}]}]}]}}
