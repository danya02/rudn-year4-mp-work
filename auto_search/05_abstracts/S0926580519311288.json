Processing the full extent of these models can be time-consuming. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of the construction industry, stakeholders will typically only be interested in a small subset, depending on the purpose of the exchange. Therefore, the retrieval of relevant subsets, whether spatially, based on discipline, or others, is necessary to effectively consume such datasets in downstream applications."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0110", "view": "all"}, "_": "Prevalent encoding forms of IFC models are text-based and do not facilitate random-access seeking within the file and do not impose an ordering on the definition of elements within the file.
