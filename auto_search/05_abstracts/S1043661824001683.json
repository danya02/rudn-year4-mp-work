Subsequent overexpression and knockdown experiments on MH7A, a human synoviocyte cell line, unveiled a previously unrecognized role of Mid1 in synoviocyte proliferation and migration, the key aspects of synovial activation. Co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis identified DPP4 as the most significant candidate of Mid1 substrates. Mechanistically, Mid1 promoted synoviocyte proliferation and migration by inducing ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of DPP4. DPP4 deficiency led to increased proliferation, migration, and inflammatory cytokine production in MH7A, while reconstitution of DPP4 significantly abolished Mid1-induced augmentation of cell proliferation and activation.
