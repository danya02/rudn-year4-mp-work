There has been an increase in vaccine-related adverse events worldwide, particularly in developing countries, attributed to suboptimal temperatures during transport and storage. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in a paradigm shift in vaccine information and storage monitoring, enabling continuous 24/7 tracking. This further reduces the dependence on limited human resources and significantly reduces the associated errors and losses. This paper presents an IoT-driven framework that aims to improve the sustainability of medical cold chain management. The framework promotes trust and transparency in vaccine surveillance data by accessing and authenticating IoT devices. The proposed system aims to improve the safety and sustainability of vaccine management. Moreover, we provide detailed insights into the design and hardware components of the proposed framework. In addition, the specific use of the framework in a particular province is highlighted, covering the design of the software platform and the analysis of the hardware equipment."}]}]}]}}
