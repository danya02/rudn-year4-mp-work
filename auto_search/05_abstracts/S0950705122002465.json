The ultimate goal is to make explicit the embedded, ad-hoc pre-processes related to TIRP mining algorithms while offering an efficient solution for the required pre-processing. On the one hand, TA4L divides the signals into segments based on time duration (instead of the often-used practice based on the number of samples), which allows the construction of consistent time intervals. Concatenation of intervals is controlled by a maximum time gap constraint that reinforces the generated time intervals\u2019 consistency. Moreover, different ways to parallelise the algorithm are explored that are accompanied by efficient data structures to speed up the pre-processing cost. TA4L has been experimentally evaluated with synthetic and real datasets, and the results show that TA4L requires significantly less computation time than other state-of-the-art approaches, revealing that it is an effective algorithm."}]}]}]}}
