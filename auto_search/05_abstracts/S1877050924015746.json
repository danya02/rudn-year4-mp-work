An architecture of the DPP is presented built upon the principles of data spaces and W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). By leveraging data spaces, the DPP enables secure and controlled data exchange among stakeholders, fostering transparency, traceability, and collaboration throughout the product\u2019s lifecycle. The use of decentralized identifiers ensures the uniqueness and verifiability of product-related information, facilitating seamless access and sharing of data. The DPP architecture offers a promising framework for realizing the circular economy by promoting resource efficiency, sustainable practices, and informed decision-making."}]}]}]}}
