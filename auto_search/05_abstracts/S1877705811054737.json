In order to determine the storage location of each TAG point in the distributed environment, First of all, every storage node and each TAG point are mapped to circular hash space. Secondly, create a hash table of TAG point in every storage node, which record the position of index in every TAG point. Finally, a B+ Tree index are established to organize and maintain the historical data of one TAG point. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show the validity of the proposed method."}]}]}]}}
