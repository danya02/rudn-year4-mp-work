The functional requirement of the process mining algorithm is to discover all the structural process patterns, such as linear (sequential), disjunctive (selective-OR), conjunctive (parallel-AND), and repetitive (iterative-LOOP) process patterns, from a dataset of process enactment event logs, and to eventually build a structured business process model by assembling all the discovered structural process patterns. The targeted algorithm to be verified and validated in this paper is called as "}, {"#name": "math", "$": {"xmlns:mml": true, "altimg": "si20.svg"}, "$$": [{"#name": "mrow", "$$": [{"#name": "mi", "_": "\u03c1"}]}]}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-"}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "Algorithm"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " that is especially devised for discovering a structured information control net process model (SICN-oriented process model) from a dataset especially prepared in the standardized IEEE XES event stream format.
