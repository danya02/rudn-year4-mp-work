However, automatic recording using AIMS is generally difficult because of potential noise from electronic devices affecting magnetic resonance images and device malfunction due to magnetic fields emitted during MRI. At our hospital, we have confirmed that wireless local area network (LAN) radio waves do not cause noise during MRI, and have designed a shielded box to house the wireless transmitter and electronic devices that allow a wireless LAN to pass through but shield the electronic devices from noise, thus enabling AIMS recording via a wireless LAN, even during MRI. We demonstrated the usefulness of this system with a wireless LAN connection in three cases of awake craniotomy with open MRI."}]}]}]}}
