It proposes a novel approach to simulate changes based on object-oriented concepts and presents dynamic object-oriented model. This model is used in the temporal object-oriented virtual reality mining system which involves many aspects. Firstly, it is used in mining prototype and mine data organization research, include classifying the mining space entities, analyzing the characteristics of mining entities, the resources of mining entities data and their spatial level, researching mining processing methods and the organization mining data. Secondly, the author studies object-oriented spatial-temporal data model based on the characteristics of mine. Thirdly, the object-oriented spatio-temporal mining data model is designed. Finally, this object-oriented spatial-temporal mining data model is used in the Kailuan digital mine virtual reality system in Hubei Province (China)."}]}]}]}}
