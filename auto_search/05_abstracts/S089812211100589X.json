MANETs are found very useful in real applications such as time-lacking implementations and indoor environments. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Network (BATMAN) routing protocols, in stairs environment, based on real data from our MANET testbed. We evaluate the performance considering three metrics: throughput, delay and packet loss. We design and implement two experimental scenarios: static stairs scenario and shifting stairs scenario. From our experiments, we show that as the number of hops increases to three or more hops, the performance of the communication decreases. The performance decreases further when the nodes are mobile. However, OLSR shows a better performance than BATMAN."}]}]}]}}
