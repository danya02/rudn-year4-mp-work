Its central idea is that sensory responses result from comparisons between bottom-up inputs and contextual predictions, a process in which rates and synchronization may play distinct roles. We recorded from awake macaque V1 and developed a technique to quantify stimulus predictability for natural images based on self-supervised, generative neural networks. We find that neuronal firing rates were mainly modulated by the contextual predictability of higher-order image features, which correlated strongly with human perceptual similarity judgments. By contrast, V1 gamma ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "\u03b3"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ")-synchronization increased monotonically with the contextual predictability of low-level image features and emerged exclusively for larger stimuli.
