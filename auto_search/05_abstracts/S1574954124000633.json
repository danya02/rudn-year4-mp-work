Monitoring of insect populations is key to their sustainable management. However, the labor and expertise needed to identify insects, and the challenges of archiving the wealth of data collected in monitoring programs, often limit these efforts. We describe a pipeline to reduce the barriers associated with curating and mining big data of insect biodiversity. The pipeline, STARdbi, includes capturing flying insects with sticky traps, scanning the traps, storing the trap-images in a public database with a web-based interface, and applying machine learning models to extract information from the images. To illustrate the insights that can be gained from STARdbi, we describe two case studies. One of them involves monitoring of circadian activity patterns of grain pests and of their natural enemies, and the other compares insect abundance, biomass and size distributions between agricultural and semi-natural habitats. We invite the community of insect ecologists to contribute to the STARdbi database, and to use its image analysis tools to address diverse ecological and evolutionary questions."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0055", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "We present a pipeline and database for handling images of insect sticky traps."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The database aims to support agricultural, ecological, and biodiversity studies."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Integrated AI models allow detection, counting, and body size assessment of insects."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "We also provide a standalone AI tool for insect identification."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "We invite the research community to contribute to the database and to query it."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
