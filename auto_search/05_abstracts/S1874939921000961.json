Text-mining tools can offer broad and complementary solutions to help locate and extract mentions of these biological relationships in articles. We have generated ExTRI, a knowledge graph of TF-TG relationships, by applying a high recall text-mining pipeline to MedLine abstracts identifying over 100,000 candidate sentences with TF-TG relations. Validation procedures indicated that about half of the candidate sentences contain true TF-TG relationships. Post-processing identified 53,000 high confidence sentences containing TF-TG relationships, with a cross-validation F1-score close to 75%. The resulting collection of TF-TG relationships covers 80% of the relations annotated in existing databases. It adds 11,000 other potential interactions, including relationships for ~100 TFs currently not in public TF-TG relation databases. The high confidence abstract sentences contribute 25,000 literature references not available from other resources and offer a wealth of direct pointers to functional aspects of the TF-TG interactions. Our compiled resource encompassing ExTRI together with publicly available resources delivers literature-derived TF-TG interactions for more than 900 of the 1500\u20131600 proteins considered to function as specific DNA binding TFs. The obtained result can be used by curators, for network analysis and modelling, for causal reasoning or knowledge graph mining approaches, or serve to benchmark text mining strategies."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0085", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Text-mining greatly extends the volume of transcription regulation interaction (TRI) in structured form."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The TRIs in the higher confidence subset are about 75% true and cover about 18,000 new interactions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "The resource can be used for modelling and causal reasoning."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Curation stacks can be easily defined."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
