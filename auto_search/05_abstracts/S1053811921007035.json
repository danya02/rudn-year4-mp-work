Beyond the recruitment of category-selective areas (FFA, PPA), perception of familiar faces and places has been reported to engage brain areas associated with semantic information, comprising the precuneus, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Here we used multivariate pattern analyzes (MVPA) to examine to which degree areas of the visual imagery network, category-selective and semantic areas contain information regarding the category and familiarity of imagined stimuli. Participants were instructed via auditory cues to imagine personally familiar and unfamiliar stimuli (i.e. faces and places). Using region-of-interest (ROI)-based MVPA, we were able to distinguish between imagined faces and places within nodes of the visual imagery network (V1, SPL, aIPS), within category-selective inferotemporal regions (FFA, PPA) and across all brain regions of the extended semantic network (i.e. precuneus, mPFC, IFG and TPJ). Moreover, we were able to decode familiarity of imagined stimuli in the SPL and aIPS, and in some regions of the extended semantic network (in particular, right precuneus, right TPJ), but not in V1. Our results suggest that posterior visual areas - including V1 - host categorical representations about imagined stimuli, and that stimulus familiarity might be an additional aspect that is shared between perception and visual imagery."}]}]}]}}
