Using a peculiar link protection method, a protection routing is established with unique links and working routing for every service request. Additionally, the wavelength information is taken into account to make the entire network load balanced with respect to routing choice. It is known that when the network is trouble-free, load balance is needed, and when there are some links destroyed in the network, a protection mechanism is needed. This new algorithm includes these two mechanisms while also adopting a kind of QoS guaranteed mechanism. This allows for a better network performance even under the situation that some links were destroyed and includes a higher quality of service guarantee and a lower rate of service blocking. The simulation results show that this algorithm can significantly improve the rate of service blocking and guarantee the quality of service to meet expectations."}]}]}]}}
