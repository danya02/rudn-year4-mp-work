With more energy resources located in the lower-voltage distribution system, it is increasingly helpful to utilize combined transmission and distribution (T&D) system models to analyze interactions between these normally-distinct subsystems. This paper proposes a methodology for creating very large-scale, highly detailed, combined T&D systems that are synthetic\u2014that is, free from non-public data\u2014yet still realistic. The methodology creates very large-scale combined T&D systems by merging the most up-to-date techniques for creating synthetic distribution feeder networks with the latest methods for building synthetic, meshed bulk-power transmission networks. This methodology is demonstrated on a T&D system geolocated in Texas, and benchmarked with co-simulation results. Validation demonstrates that the resulting "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "syn"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-texas-TDgrid synthetic test system realistically represents characteristics found in actual networks, addressing the lack of available T&D test systems.
