The tool captures data, makes appropriate domain suggestions, extracts various entities such as materials and processes, and helps to establish entity-value relationships. This tool uses keyword extraction, a document similarity index to suggest relevant documents, and a deep learning approach employing Bi-LSTM for entity extraction. For example, materials and processes for electrical charge storage under an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) mechanism are demonstrated herewith. A knowledge graph approach finds and visualizes different latent knowledge sets from the processed information. The MatRec received an F1 score of 9\u03036% for entity extraction, 8\u03033% for material-value relationship extraction, and 8\u03037% for process-value relationship extraction, respectively. The proposed MatRec could be extended to solve material selection issues for various applications and could be an excellent tool for academia and industry."}]}]}]}}
