NSGA-II is used as MOEA, where the number of UAVs is given by the number of deployed UAVs forming the network. An embedded genetic algorithm (inner-GA) is used to find paths that maximize the throughput. To find consistent solutions for the throughput, we use an existing fixed point algorithm (FPA) that operates on a given throughput approximation model. Simulation results show that our approach can find good solution when minimizing the number of UAVs while providing high throughput."}]}]}]}}
