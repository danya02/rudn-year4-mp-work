The system is based on a Service Oriented Architecture that allows to combine and orchestrate a large set of web services for automatic and manual annotation, retrieval, browsing, ingestion and authoring of different multimedia sources. These tools can been used to create several publicly available vertical applications, addressing different use cases. Positive results of usability test evaluations have shown that the system can be effectively used to create video retrieval systems."}]}]}]}}
