It is a process by which certain events or actions are normalized by virtue of the authority one holds. Through legitimization practices, politicians are provided with the means of offering implicit reasons to complete their actions through using certain discursive tools. This study examines the language of Trump\u2019s speech before his supporters stormed the Capitol. This is done with the aim of investigating the legitimation discursive tools employed throughout which eventually led to the attack. The analysis is employed through utilizing van Leeuwen\u2019s legitimation framework (2008). Within this framework, van Leeuwen offers four main legitimation strategies (1)authorization, (2)evaluation, (3)rationalization, and (4)mythopoesis. A tag set of these categories is created and annotated into the corpus chosen for this corpus based study and later retrieved using a concordance programme."}]}]}]}}
