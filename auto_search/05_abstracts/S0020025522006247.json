Most existing methods rely on annotated or external data and require retraining models following a region change, thus preventing their large-scale applications. Herein, we propose an unsupervised method denoted as UPAPP for the semantic place annotation of individual trajectories using spatiotemporal information. The Bayesian Criterion is specifically employed to decompose the spatiotemporal probability of visiting the candidate place into spatial probability, duration probability, and visiting time probability. Spatial information in two geospatial data sources is comprehensively integrated to calculate the spatial probability. In terms of the temporal probabilities, the Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency weighting algorithm is used to count the potential visits to different place types in the trajectories and to generate the prior probabilities of the visiting time and duration. Finally, the spatiotemporal probability of the candidate place is then combined with the importance of the place category to annotate the visited places. Experimental results in a trajectory dataset collected by 709 volunteers in Beijing showed that our method achieved an overall and average accuracy of 0.712 and 0.720, respectively, indicating that the visited places can be annotated accurately without any annotated data."}]}]}]}}
