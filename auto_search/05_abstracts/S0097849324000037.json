For example, tele-ultrasound can bring much-needed expert healthcare to isolated communities. However, existing tele-guidance methods have serious limitations including either low precision for video conference-based systems, or high complexity and cost for telerobotics. A new concept called human teleoperation leverages mixed reality, haptics, and high-speed communication to provide tele-guidance that gives an expert nearly-direct remote control without requiring a robot. This paper provides an overview of the human teleoperation concept and its application to tele-ultrasound. The concept and its impact are discussed. A new approach to remote streaming and control of point-of-care ultrasound systems independent of their manufacturer is described, as is a high-speed communication system for the HoloLens 2 that is compatible with ResearchMode API sensor stream access. Details of these systems are shown in supplementary video demonstrations. Novel interaction methods enabled by HoloLens 2-based pose tracking are also introduced and tests of the communication and user interaction are presented. The results show continued improvement of the system compared to previous work in instrumentation, HCI, and communication. The system thus has good potential for tele-ultrasound, as well as possible other applications of human teleoperation including remote maintenance, inspection, and training. The remote ultrasound streaming and control application is made available open source."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1313"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1314"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1316"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1317"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S0097849324000037/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "id": "d1e1321"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1322"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1323"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1325"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1326"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1328"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1329"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1332"}, "_": "System improvements to human teleoperation demonstrate its feasibility."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1334"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1337"}, "_": "Other devices such as the Nreal Light can be used for implementation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1339"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1342"}, "_": "New device-agnostic remote ultrasound streaming and control demonstrated."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1344"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1347"}, "_": "HoloLens pose tracking enables human teleoperation with limited compute resources."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1349"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1352"}, "_": "HoloLens-based communication system provides effective sensor data streaming."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
