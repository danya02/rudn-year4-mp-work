In addition, if the information in a student's question is unclear, the teacher is burdened with extra interactions, such as asking the student questions. We propose the question database with an improved user interface that allows students to write their questions using the Moodle module. We analyse the number of questions and answers in asynchronous distance lectures to see if the extra communication between teacher and student could be reduced."}]}]}]}}
