This emerging method primarily focus on developing methods for handling and exploring voluminous information represented in distinct types of data. Deployment of data mining in education helps to better understand the synergy between the learning and educational settings established by the institutions to foster their learning activity. This work presents a data mining based virtual simulation experimental teaching system which provisions personalized interactive learning, real-world scene experimental training and comprehensive assessment of the learning effect. The proposed system employs interactive programming, automatic evaluation of experimental results, assessing the impact of teaching effectiveness with other modules. The work also provides a series of comprehensive cases and programming experiments apart from presenting the execution pages. The results indicate that this system can intuitively help students to improve their learning process, student participation and foster independent learning ability. The application of data mining alleviates the dependency on complex programming paradigms to make learning analytics, which is beneficial to both the teaching and learning communities."}]}]}]}}
