In any business, maintaining the log records securely over a particular period of time is absolutely necessary for various reasons such as auditing, forensic analysis, evidence etc. In this work, Integrity and confidentiality of the log records are maintained at every stage of Log Management namely the Log Generation phase, Transmission phase and Storage phase. In addition to this, Log records may often contain sensitive information about the organization which should not be leaked to the outside world. In this paper, Temporal Secured Cloud Log Management Algorithm techniques are implemented to provide security to maintain transaction history in cloud within time period. In this work, security to temporal log management is provided by encrypting the log data before they are stored in the cloud storage. They are also stored in batches for easy retrieval. This work was implemented in Java programming language in the Google drive environment."}]}]}]}}
