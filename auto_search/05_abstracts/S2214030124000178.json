Biocatalytic depolymerization mediated by enzymes has emerged as an efficient and sustainable alternative for plastic treatment and recycling. However, it is challenging and time-consuming to discover novel plastic-degrading enzymes using conventional cultivation-based or omics methods. There is a growing interest in developing effective computational methods to identify new enzymes with desirable plastic degradation functionalities by exploring the ever-increasing databases of protein sequences. In this study, we designed an innovative machine learning-based framework, named PEZy-Miner, to mine for enzymes with high potential in degrading plastics of interest. Two datasets integrating information from experimentally verified enzymes and homologs with unknown plastic-degrading activity were created respectively, covering eleven types of plastic substrates. Protein language models and binary classification models were developed to predict enzymatic degradation of plastics along with confidence and uncertainty estimation. PEZy-Miner exhibited high prediction accuracy and stability when validated on experimentally verified enzymes. Furthermore, by masking the experimentally verified enzymes and blending them into homolog dataset, PEZy-Miner effectively concentrated the experimentally verified entries by 14\u223c30 times while shortlisting promising plastic-degrading enzyme candidates. We applied PEZy-Miner to 0.1 million putative sequences, out of which 27 new sequences were identified with high confidence. This study provided a new computational tool for mining and recommending promising new plastic-degrading enzymes."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Machine learning is used to learn protein language and predict plastic degradation."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Confidence and uncertainty estimation identifies top-ranked enzyme candidates."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "27 out of 0.1 million sequences are discovered as promising candidates."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "PEZy-Miner is developed to help end-user mine for top enzymes candidates."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
