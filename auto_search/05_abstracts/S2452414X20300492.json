This paper highlights the benefits of information fusion with real-time locating systems (RTLS) and demonstrates how position and acceleration data can be utilised for the simulation-based analysis of product-specific activity times. The proposed digital twin is continuously capable to predict the production status and provide information for monitoring of production performance thanks to the real time connections of the RTLS and adaptive simulation models. The presented industrial case study demonstrates how the resulted Simulation 4.0 concept supports the analysis of human resource effectiveness (HRE) in an assembly process."}]}]}]}}
