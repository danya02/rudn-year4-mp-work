There are three kinds of nodes in the algorithm: cluster head node (CH), core node (CNs) and sensor node (SNs). The CH node performs topology control routing and monitors the energy state of the sns. The CNS stores multicast routing state information to minimize routing complexity when a link fails. The SNs participates in multicast routing supported by the core node network. It saves energy consumption of the CNs and improves the performance of the entire network. The simulation results show that in SDSMR algorithm, HGMR algorithm and DCAMEM algorithm, SDSMR algorithm can effectively shorten the delay time and improve the energy saving rate and throughput rate."}]}]}]}}
