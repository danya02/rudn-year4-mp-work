In a step-by-step example, we use self-collected data to perform several analyses of the glass ceiling. Our tutorial can serve as a standalone introduction to data science for qualitative researchers and business researchers, who have avoided learning to program. It should also be useful for experienced data scientists who want to learn about the tools that will allow them to collect and analyze data more easily and effectively."}]}]}]}}
