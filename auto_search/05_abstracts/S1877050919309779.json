Several advantages can be derived from the network simulation, such as the saving of time and budgets. However, the simulation can sometimes represent certain limits if the concept to be simulated is large-scale or very advanced whose simple setting wrong can question the reliability of the results. These concepts include the coexistence of the two IPv4 and IPv6 protocols in a large-scale network such as the internet. No one can deny that most Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide only an IPv4-based access network, however, client sites can use IPv6 locally. Several transition mechanisms and address translation techniques can be used to successfully coexist two different protocols. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automate the simulation of IPv6 and IPv4 transition mechanisms in a large scale network. The proposed approach is compatible with the Riverbed Modeler simulator and it may be modified to include other network simulators. The results of the evaluation of the approach show that the duration of setting up a network of 100 interconnected IPv6 nodes over an IPv4 network does not exceed 30 seconds in total."}]}]}]}}
