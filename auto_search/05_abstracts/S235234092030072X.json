Over 2000 photographs from the Ebro Delta Natural Park, N-E Spain, have been treated. Raw data come from Wikiloc, a Volunteered Geographic Information source, and have been cleansed and systematized. The photographs have been classified according to their image content. An automatic first analysis was performed using 8-bit software. For uncertain tags, a second supervised analysis was performed. Classification into eight types and thirty-seven subtypes was conducted by considering landscape and social reactions. Data have been treated with the ArcGis 10.2. Geographic Information System. This dataset is useful for understanding ecosystem services by means of users' photographs."}]}]}]}}
