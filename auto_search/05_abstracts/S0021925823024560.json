Here, we demonstrate that the human KRAB-zinc finger protein ZNF268a is essential for virus-induced interferon signaling. We find that cytoplasmic ZNF268a is constantly degraded by lysosome and thus remains low expressed in resting cell cytoplasm. Upon viral infection, TBK1 interacts with cytosolic ZNF268a to catalyze the phosphorylation of Serine 178 of ZNF268a, which prevents the degradation of ZNF268a, resulting in the stabilization and accumulation of ZNF268a in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we provide evidence that stabilized ZNF268a recruits the lysine methyltransferase SETD4 to TBK1 to induce the mono-methylation of TBK1 on lysine 607, which is critical for the assembly of the TBK1 signaling complex. Notably, ZNF268 S178 is conserved among higher primates but absent in rodents. Meanwhile, rodent TBK1 607th aa happens to be replaced by arginine, possibly indicating a species-specific role of ZNF268a in regulating TBK1 during evolution. These findings reveal novel functions of ZNF268a and SETD4 in regulating antiviral interferon signaling."}]}]}]}}
