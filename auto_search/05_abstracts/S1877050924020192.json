In hardware part: control the reading and writing equipment according to the predetermined working mode, adjust the parameters of the reader, connect the circuit and other accessories; in software part: increase the correlation between the tables by setting foreign keys, build the logistics enterprise distribution information database, control and supervise the logistics activities. The result shows that the average value of cargo throughput between the real-time tracking system of distribution information of logistics enterprises in the paper and two other real-time tracking systems of logistics enterprises is 1412.14 T/H, 1049.38 T/H and 1088.81 T/H respectively, indicating that the real-time tracking system of distribution information of logistics enterprises designed after the application of IOT technology is more perfect."}]}]}]}}
