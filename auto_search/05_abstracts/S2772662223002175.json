Initially, a thorough literature review was employed to identify 13 critical factors, and then the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology was used to analyse their cause\u2013effect relationship. Next, a qualitative analysis concluded that \u2018Technology Integration\u2019 and \u2018Forecasting\u2019 are essential for adopting machine learning in manufacturing supply chains, \u2018Risk Management\u2019 is unaffected by causal factors, and \u2018Manufacturing Processes\u2019 is minor in adopting machine learning. The research findings aim to guide the practitioners in understanding the influence of one factor over the other and the \u2018cause\u2013effect\u2019 relation among them. The strategies for the effective implementation of machine learning technologies may be deduced. It is a pioneering study in which novel and crucial determinants have been identified and examined in the multi-criteria environment using the DEMATEL approach."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e3528"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e3529"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3531"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3532"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e3534"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3535"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3538"}, "_": "Identify the critical factors for adopting machine learning in manufacturing supply chains."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3540"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3543"}, "_": "Identify and analyse thirteen critical factors using a multi-criteria decision-making framework."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3555"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3558"}, "_": "Show \u2018Technology Integration\u2019 and \u2018Forecasting\u2019 are essential for adopting machine learning."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3560"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3563"}, "_": "Offer guidance to practitioners in understanding the cause\u2013effect relationship between the factors."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3565"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e3568"}, "_": "Present novel and crucial determinants influencing the adoption of machine learning technologies."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
