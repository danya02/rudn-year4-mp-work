Internet Protocol (IP) over Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networking technology with Terabits per second bandwidth become a natural choice for the future generation internet networks (Optical Internets), wide area network (WAN) environments and backbone networks due to its potential ability to meet rising demands of high bandwidth and low latency communication. Recently Virtual Topology Reconfiguration of IP over WDM networks has received greater attention among researchers. Optimation technique finds many applications in the field of network engineering, which includes linear programming, traffic prediction, network modeling, traffic modeling, etc. In this paper, we have presented a new approach for reconfiguring virtual topology of IP over WDM networks using optimization technique. The computed results show that this new approach achieves better performance in terms of computational accuracy, number of changes and average weighted hop count."}]}]}]}}
