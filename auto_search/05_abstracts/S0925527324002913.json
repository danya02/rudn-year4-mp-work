Therefore, our study draws upon the Dynamic Capability Theory and employs an exploratory, in-depth single case study approach to bridge this research gap. We identify three key digital platform capabilities: data integration capability, data analytics capability, and data productization capability. Our results demonstrate that these capabilities function as \u201creservoirs,\u201d \u201ccatalysts,\u201d and \u201cpipelines\u201d in a specific iterative sequence to unlock data value, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of digital servitization in digital enterprises. Furthermore, these capabilities are interconnected, collectively forming a dynamic capability\u2014digital platform capability\u2014that unlocks data value by integrating and reconfiguring data resources. Additionally, we delineate the differences in digital servitization between digital enterprises and traditional manufacturers across three dimensions: motivation, key service design activities, and benefits. Our findings enrich the existing literature on digital platform capabilities and data value while expanding the research scope of digital servitization from the perspective of digital enterprises."}]}]}]}}
