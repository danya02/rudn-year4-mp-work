In this paper we discuss the broad lessons learnt in the wider mining industry that may be relevant to the phosphate rock industry. In particular, we suggest that it is innovation, particularly in technology that holds the key to more sustainable mining. Breakthrough developments in automation, in sorting, comminution and flotation are highlighted together with some suggestions as to how a more collaborative approach is needed to bring through step changes in the industry."}]}]}]}}
