In recent years, the importance of intestinal microstructure and function in IBS-D has been emphasized. However, the intestinal tissue proteomics of IBS-D patients has not been analyzed. Here, we systematically analyzed the molecule profiling of the intestinal tissues in IBS-D patients through tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics for the first time, aiming to reveal the pathogenesis and provide evidence for diagnosis and treatment of IBS-D. Five IBS-D patients and five healthy subjects were selected, biopsy tissue samples from the junction of sigmoid and rectum were analyzed by TMT proteomics. Differentially expressed proteins were obtained and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Furthermore, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and q-PCR detection were applied to validate the differentially expressed proteins. Eighty differentially expressed proteins were screened, 48 of which were up-regulated and 32 were down-regulated (fold change >1.2, "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "P"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Bioinformatics analysis showed that these proteins were significantly enriched in the nutrient ingestion pathways which are related to immune molecules.

It is still a challenge to accurately locate the pathogenesis of patients for appropriate treatment strategy. Established proteomics studies of IBS-D are only based on urine, blood, or tissue samples from animals. Our study was the first TMT proteomics analysis on intestinal biopsy tissues of patients with IBS-D, which revealed the changes of molecular spectrum of actual intestinal conditions in patients with IBS-D. Some important molecules and signaling pathways have been found abnormal in our study, which were related with nutrient uptake. They not only provided preliminary clues for low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) intolerance, an unsolved conundrum of IBS-D, but also revealed obscure problems of protein, lipid, and other nutrients ingestion in IBS-D patients. Some of these differentially expressed molecules have been preliminarily verified, and will may be potential candidate molecules for diagnostic markers of IBS-D."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "ab0010", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0075", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "f0050"}, "$$": [{"#name": "alt-text", "$": {"id": "al0065", "role": "short"}, "_": "Unlabelled Image"}, {"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "lk0050", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S1874391920303638/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4", "type": "simple"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0015", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0080", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "TMT proteomics of IBS-D intestinal tissue were analyzed for the first time."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Nutrient uptake-related molecules and signaling pathways were abnormal."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Preliminary clues for low FODMAP intolerance were provided."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Potential diagnosis biomarkers of IBS-D were provided."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
