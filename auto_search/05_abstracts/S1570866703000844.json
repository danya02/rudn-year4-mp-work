Although hand-crafted heuristics are a common practical approach for extracting information from text, a general, and generalizable, approach requires adaptive techniques. This paper studies the way in which the adaptive techniques used in text compression can be applied to text mining. It develops several examples: extraction of hierarchical phrase structures from text, identification of keyphrases in documents, locating proper names and quantities of interest in a piece of text, text categorization, word segmentation, acronym extraction, and structure recognition. We conclude that compression forms a sound unifying principle that allows many text mining problems to be tacked adaptively."}]}]}]}}
