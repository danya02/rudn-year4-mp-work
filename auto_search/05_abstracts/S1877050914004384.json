The system is intended for knowledge discovery from various data sources, including structured quantitative data and text collections. Final version of data transformation from external data source into concept lattice is considered. We introduce new version of local data storage, query language for conceptual scaling of data snapshots as multi-valued contexts, and new tools for working with formal concepts."}]}]}]}}
