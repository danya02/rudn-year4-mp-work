Packet throttling is a cost effective technique which simply delays packet injection into the network. However, deciding on when to throttle and how much to throttle are key design challenges of any throttling technique. Existing techniques use local throttling decisions by a central controller. This paper overcome the issues related with the existing works by partitioning the network into number of sub-networks, each with a zonal controller. The experimental results with real traffic workloads show substantial reduction in average packet latency when compared with state of the art packet throttling techniques."}]}]}]}}
