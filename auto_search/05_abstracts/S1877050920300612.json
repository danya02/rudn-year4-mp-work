It affects the memory of the affected individual by causing neuron degeneration. Such cognitive disability leads people to roam around places since they are ignorant about location. They may go afar from the safe area to traffic prone areas which cause serious, life threatening issues to them. Proposed study introduces a technology that involves a wearable device for Alzheimer disease affected elderly patients and listening device given to care takers or doctors. This system detects and notifies caregivers about the departure of people to risk locations from their residence zone. This system uses Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) communication technology that utilizes transmitter and receiver fixed to elderly individual as wearable device and in residence respectively. Based on the signal strength between the transmitter and receiver, the distance estimation between the elderly and the receiver is calculated with the help of a Raspberry Pi(Rpi) and an alert notification is sent to doctors/caretakers when the distance exceeds safety limit."}]}]}]}}
