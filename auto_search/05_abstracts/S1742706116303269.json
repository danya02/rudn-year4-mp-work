We find that the addition of a charged group produces networks with depleted intra-connectivity, which translates to a mechanically weaker and more deformable network. This large variation in network structure is achieved by the formation of shorter mutant filaments, which exhibit differing assembly kinetics and a manifestly reduced capacity to form the extended structures characteristic of the wild-type system. The similarity in outcome for all the phosphomimicry mutants explored points to a more general mechanism of structural modulation of intermediate filaments via phosphorylation.

We show how phosphorylation reduces keratin filament length, an effect that propagates through to the mesoscopic structure, resulting in the formation of connectivity-depleted and mechanically weaker networks.

Overall, our results shed light on how self-assembled intermediate filament structures can be tailored to exhibit different structural functionalities."}]}]}]}]}}
