The communication issue is played major role in design of effective NoCs. In order to achieve better communication among the multiple cores in NoC, an efficient routing algorithm is required. To evaluate the performance of NoCs, the performance parameters like throughput, energy and path length are focused by applying different routing algorithms. In this paper, we have analyzed network partitioning based on routing path and implemented two different routing algorithms named as Path Based Shortest Path (PBSP) and All Pair Shortest Path (APSP) algorithms for multicast messaging. These algorithms are developed and evaluated using C/C++ and Network Simulator for 2D Mesh NoC respectively. And finally we compare and analyze these two algorithms in terms of throughput and energy"}]}]}]}}
