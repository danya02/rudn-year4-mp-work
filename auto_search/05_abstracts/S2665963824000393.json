We present a prototype for classifying the pairs of sentences using their syntactic and semantic relations. The sentences are classified into three classes \u2014 entailment, contradiction and neutral. The grammatical relations of the sentences are extracted and these relations are represented as word embeddings using global vector, Glove. The word to word semantics is found using Wordnet semantic relations. The prototype is based on statistical measures which was implemented using Python 3.6.9 version."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e158"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e159"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e161"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e162"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e164"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e165"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e168"}, "_": "We propose a software prototype for recognizing textual entailment based on pre-trained word embeddings and enhanced wordnet relations."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e170"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e173"}, "_": "We detect entailment and contradiction in sentence pairs making use of syntactic structure, semantic relations and dependency relations."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e175"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e178"}, "_": "An improved Lemmatization algorithm based on parts-of-speech tags is used to obtain the base form of words."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
