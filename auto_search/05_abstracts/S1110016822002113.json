One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques."}]}]}]}}
