The continuous growth in the wireless customers and traffic volumes and the consequent energy demand on modern carriers\u2019 broadband infrastructures require reconsidering their energy efficiency, by starting from the formulation of new, more complete and representative network models that should become the foundations for modern energy-aware control plane architectures."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp000075", "view": "all"}, "_": "Accordingly, this work presents a novel comprehensive energy model for next-generation wireless access-over-optical-transport networks characterized by hybrid power systems (i.e., multiple dynamically available power sources). The objective is to identify the energy-related information that need to be handled at the control plane layer to support energy-aware networking practices. Such information can be made available to suitable energy-aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms that may exploit them to optimize the overall network energy-consumption and reducing the associated carbon footprint. The proposed model may be taken as a reference for the implementation of new energy-aware control plane protocols (routing and signaling) that make use of power-related considerations to achieve energy-efficiency and energy-awareness in wavelength-routed network infrastructures."}]}]}]}}
