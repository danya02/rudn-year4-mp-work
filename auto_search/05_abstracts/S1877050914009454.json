An indoor air quality monitoring system helps in the detection and improvement of indoor air quality. The monitoring systems presently available are very expensive. In this paper, we present a low-cost indoor air quality monitoring wireless sensor network system developed using Arduino, XBee modules, and micro gas sensors. The system that we have developed is capable of collecting six air quality parameters from different locations simultaneously. We have also developed a linear least square estimation-based method for sensor calibration and measurement data conversion. The performance and usefulness of the system are demonstrated by comparing measurement results of our system and a professional-grade air quality measurement device."}]}]}]}}
