The goal is to create a more intelligent and responsive system that can effectively cater to consumer needs while simultaneously improving the reliability and efficiency of contemporary energy infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key enabling technology for Smart Energy Hubs (SEH). While IoT offers a plethora of innovative solutions across various sectors, including critical infrastructure, it also introduces new security challenges. Since IoT devices inherently connect to the internet, SEH systems become susceptible to a wider range of cyberattacks. This vulnerability heightens as the number of integrated IoT devices increases. A single compromised device can expose the entire hub to cyber threats. Such attacks on energy sources have the potential to cripple entire cities, resulting in significant economic devastation. Therefore, robust security measures must be implemented before the widespread adoption of IoT-based devices in energy systems. This research delves into the architecture and infrastructure of IoT-enabled SEH. Following this, the focus shifts to analyzing the primary challenges and security concerns associated with their deployment. Finally, the research emphasizes cutting-edge approaches and tools that can bolster the security and resilience of IoT-enabled SEH against contemporary physical and cyber threats. Implementing secure and advanced data transmission systems based on blockchain technology holds promise in safeguarding the entire EH from cyber-physical attacks in the future."}]}]}]}]}}
