Here, security is a serious concern that can be ensured by an authentication scheme based on the Self-Adaptive Flower Pollination based RSA (SA-FPRSA) scheme to ensure data integrity. The SA-FPRSA plays an initial role in ensuring security by enabling authenticated data availability. On the other hand, the resource allocation to the Virtual Machine (VM) is a challenging task due to overwhelmed data in a VM that may face unnecessary energy consumption and time complexity issues. Therefore, the proposed model has introduced a Self-adaptive Heap-based optimizer (HBO) for Multi-Cloud based resource allocation. The performance of the models is evaluated. The proposed model attained an Efficiency of 99.09% and Security of 98.72%. Thus, from the results, the recommended model is proven to be better than the existing models."}]}]}]}}
