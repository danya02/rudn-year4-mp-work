The collection of letters is precious resources as historical material, and the collection is analyzed for finding historical information. To construct a database of letters and to build a management system for the database are meaningful. Moreover, to develop a system is required for supporting to analyze the collection. A prototype system has been developing to meet these requirements. This prototype system provides some functions to manage letters, and to analyze letters and words in them. Moreover, this system deals with letters which are contents of the part of the Avery Brundage collection. Furthermore, several types of relationships among letters and words are visualized using graphs."}]}]}]}}
