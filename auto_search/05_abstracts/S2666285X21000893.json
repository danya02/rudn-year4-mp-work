This proposed model presents the development of the Internet of Things and Machine learning technique-based solutions to overcome this problem. Raspberry Pi runs the machine algorithm, which is interfaced with the ESP8266 Wireless Fidelity module, Pi Camera, Buzzer, and LED. Machine learning algorithms like Region-based Convolutional Neural Network and Single Shot Detection technology plays an important role to detect the object in the images and classify the animals. The experimentation reveals that the Single Shot Detection algorithm outperforms than Region-based Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. Finally, the Twilio API interfaced software decimates the information to the farmers to take decisive action in their farm field."}]}]}]}}
