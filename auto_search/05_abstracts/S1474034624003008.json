The latent nature of these issues often leads to undetected vulnerabilities until a catastrophic failure occurs, resulting in substantial losses. To address this challenge, there is a critical need for improved structural monitoring, condition assessment, and maintenance practices. Traditional inspection methods, relying on visual estimation and heavy equipment for inaccessible areas, present formidable obstacles to inspectors. These methods impede the safe and fast examination of structural damage, complicating tracking of structural deterioration, and hindering efficient condition assessment. Recognizing these challenges, this paper proposes a remote collaborative framework to enhance the efficiency of structural inspections by leveraging the capabilities of Augmented Reality (AR), QR code, and 5G network. The proposed framework centers on real-time remote collaboration among on-site and off-site inspectors, aiming to elevate safety, accessibility, and overall inspection efficacy. The integration of real-time data sharing and collaboration facilitates immediate decision-making, enabling inspectors to proactively address structural vulnerabilities and prevent potential failures. This study concludes that the proposed framework effectively facilitates real-time structural condition assessment for on-site AR users. Simultaneously, off-site web users can instantly track the progression of data over time through the utilization of 5G technology. The proposed advanced AR framework effectively demonstrates real-time structural condition assessment through a lab-scale experimental beam and a full-scale bridge."}]}]}]}}
