WSNs are a promising approach used in various applications but finding an optimal route discovery is more problematic due to dynamicity, heterogeneity, resource scarcity and so on. Generally, residual energy of sensors in sink coverage area is drained very quickly compared to other areas in WSNs. The proposed Optimized QoS-based Clustering with Multipath Routing Protocol (OQoS-CMRP) for WSNs reduces the energy consumption in sink coverage area by applying the Modified Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)-based clustering algorithm to form clusters to select cluster heads in the sink coverage area and to solve energy hole problem. The SingleSink-AllDestination algorithm is used to find near optimal multi-hop communication path from sink to sensors for selecting the next hop neighbor nodes. The Round-robinPathsSelection algorithm is used for transferring data to sink. According to QoS metrics, the performance of the proposed communication protocol is evaluated and compared with other existing protocols namely EE-LEACH and EPSO-CEO. The simulation result shows that OQoS-CMRP for WSN achieves prominent data communication with reasonable energy conservation. It also reduces transmission delay and communication overhead on the basis of ensuring the outcome of the entire network."}]}]}]}}
