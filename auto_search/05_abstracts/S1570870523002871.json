More specifically, we propose a CrowdSensing-based technique for proximity detection. Users\u2019 smartphones can collect and upload RSS (Received Signal Strength) values of nearby Bluetooth tags to a backend server, together with some context-information. In turn, the collected data are elaborated with the goal of calibrating two proximity detection algorithms: a range-based and a learning-based algorithm. We embed the algorithms with R-app, a visiting museum application tested in the Monumental Cemetery\u2019s museum located in Piazza dei Miracoli, Pisa (IT). We detail in this work an experimental campaign to measure the performance improvements of the CrowdSensing approach with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms widely adopted in the field of proximity detection. Experimental results show a clear improvement of the performance when data from the crowd are exploited with the proposed architecture."}]}]}]}}
