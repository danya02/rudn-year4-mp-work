This approach consists in translating a UML2.0 model onto a process algebra, namely PEPA nets, model. Once the process algebra model generated, performance analysis of the modelled system can be carried out. In this paper, we show how to use this approach to investigate the performance of a software retrieval service."}]}]}]}}
