However, conventional LCD methods often encounter challenges when dealing with variations in illumination, changes in viewpoint, and environments with weak textures. This is due to their reliance on low-level geometric or image features. To address these issues, we propose a robust LCD method named SL-LCD, which integrates semantic information and line features to fully leverage the semantic content and line attributes within indoor scenes, thereby establishing a reliable feature correspondence between query images and loop closure images. For the retrieval of candidate closed-loop images, we construct a semantic-line-segment topological graph and introduce a graph matching algorithm to perform the LCD task. This approach fully exploits image features and spatial information to achieve closed-loop detection in complex indoor scenes. Furthermore, we present a semantic voxel-based generalized ICP (SVGICP) closed-loop relocalization algorithm tailored for challenging and complex indoor scenes, enhancing the accuracy of closed-loop relocalization in such scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the SL-LCD algorithm proposed in this paper surpasses state-of-the-art methods, accurately detecting closed loops, and effectively eliminating trajectory drift."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e695", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e696"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e698", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e699", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e701"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e702"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e705", "view": "all"}, "_": "Robust LCD method integrates 3D semantic-line features for loop closure detection and relocalization."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e707"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e710", "view": "all"}, "_": "Graph node affinity matrix fuses semantic and line features, aiding accurate graph matching."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e712"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e715", "view": "all"}, "_": "Coarse-to-fine relocalization leverages Sim(3) and semantic-enhanced VGICP algorithms."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
