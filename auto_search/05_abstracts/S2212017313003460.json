This standard is a low cost, low rate, low power wireless personal area network technology. Hence, 6LoWPAN is defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as Internet Protocol (IP) applied into IEEE 802.15.4 devices. 6LoWPAN Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (LOAD) and 6LoWPAN Ad Hoc On- Demand Distance Vector Routing with Multipath Scheme (MLOAD) are based on Ad-Hoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV), and simplify the routing protocol for 6LoWPAN mesh network. The AODV, LOAD and MLOAD for 6LoWPAN mesh network to broadcast route request (RREQ) message of route discovery is devoid of load the whole network overhead. In this paper, we proposed the 6LoWPAN Local Repair Using Bio Inspired Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to find a route to the destination that reduce network overhead of route discovery."}]}]}]}}
