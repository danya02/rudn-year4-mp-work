The fine weave that made up the songket texture is what make it stand out from the rest of the fabric. Literature study showed more than 300 songket motives had been produced since the beginning and was stored digitally as preservation effort. Preliminary studies on 10 websites that promote and trade songket in Malaysia reveal that preservation of the motive was not a priority since they only stress on the selling of the product. The website only provides a keyword search for the customer to find songket based on their finished motives. Biggest drawback is the user didn\u2019t aware of the abundance of motive; hence making the search less effective. Previous study also shows there is no website that provide repository of songket motives information as a long term preservation effort. This research will focus on information gathering and imaging access of songket motives through sketching technique. Method of study is by analysing existing songket website and image access technique. Result of the research will be a prototype of songket motive repository system which will help user to access the motive through sketching technique."}]}]}]}}
