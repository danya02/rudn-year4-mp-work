In such networks, wake-up radio (WuR) is gaining its popularity thanks to its on-demand transmission feature and overwhelming energy consumption superiority. Despite this advantage, overhearing still occurs when a wake-up receiver decodes the address of a wake-up call (WuC) which is not intended to it, causing a certain amount of extra energy waste in the network. Moreover, long latency may occur due to WuC address decoding since WuCs are transmitted at a very low data rate. In this paper, we propose two schemes, i.e., early sleeping (ES) and early data transmission (EDT), to further reduce energy consumption and latency in WuR-enabled IoT/WSNs. The ES scheme decodes and validates an address bit-by-bit, allowing those non-destined devices go to sleep at an earlier stage. The EDT scheme enables a sender to transmit small IoT data together with WuC packets so that the main radio does not have to be in full operation for data reception. We implement both schemes through a WuR testbed. Furthermore, we present a framework based on M/G/1 and assess the performance of the schemes through both theoretical analysis and simulations."}]}]}]}}
