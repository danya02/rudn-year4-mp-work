To achieve this goal, a holistic design based on the use of power-aware components should be performed. One of the key components of an HPC system is the high-speed interconnect. In this paper, we compare and evaluate several design options for the interconnection network of an HPC system, including torus, fat-trees and dragonflies. State of the art low power modes are also used in the interconnection networks. The paper does not only consider energy efficiency at the interconnection network level but also at the system as a whole."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1550"}, "_": "The analysis is performed by using a simple yet realistic power model of the system. The model has been adjusted using actual power consumption values measured on a real system. Using this model, realistic multi-job trace-based workloads have been used, obtaining the execution time and energy consumed. The results are presented to ease choosing a system, depending on which parameter, performance or energy consumption, receives the most importance."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1552"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1553"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1555"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1556"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1558"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1559"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1562"}, "_": "Measurements in modern HPC hardware have been taken to fix the model parameters."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1564"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1567"}, "_": "Torus topology shows the best trade-off between energy and runtime."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1569"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1572"}, "_": "Fat-tree shows good energy efficiency under low traffic loads."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1574"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1577"}, "_": "Fat-tree shows the worst energy efficiency under high loads."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1579"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1582"}, "_": "Dragonfly topology energy efficiency is close to the torus topology."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1584"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1587"}, "_": "Power saving strategies reduce energy with negligible performance overhead."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1589"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1592"}, "_": "Using aggressive Power-Down Threshold greatly worsens the dragonfly performance."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
