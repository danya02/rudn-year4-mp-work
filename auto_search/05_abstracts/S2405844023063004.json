To make an accurate prediction of the risk level of the goaf quickly, this paper optimizes the features of the goaf by correlation analysis and feature importance and constructs a combination of feature parameters for the risk level prediction of the goaf to solve the problem of redundancy of evaluation indexes. Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied to 121 sets of goaf data respectively, and the optimal algorithm and the best combination of feature parameters are obtained by evaluating the mining area with multiple indicators such as accuracy and kappa coefficient. The best combination of features parameters are ground-water, goaf layout, volume of goaf, goaf volume, span-height ratio, and mining disturbance, and the optimal algorithm is Extra Tree (ET), which needles the goaf risk level prediction problem with the accuracy of 94%. This model can be used to solve the problem of how to quickly and accurately predict the risk level of the goaf."}]}]}]}}
