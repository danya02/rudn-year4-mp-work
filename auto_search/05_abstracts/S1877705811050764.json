But at present, prediction of air thermal parameters is realized mainly by empirical formula and forecast method of single-line(main trunk road method), existing many disadvantages such as strong individual subjectivity, bad theoretical property and low forecasting precision. Therefore, a kind of air temperature prediction model in whole ventilation network based on wind enthalpy equation is put forward. By the model, air temperature prediction software in whole ventilation network which can make reasonable forecast of thermal parameters for different high temperature mines is programmed by determining air thermal parameters through wind energy equation and considering the influence of natural wind pressure. Through the prediction of the air thermal parameters of the wind route in the fifth mining area in east wing of Dongtan colliery, it can be seen that air temperature prediction model in whole ventilation network is scientific, reasonable and with strong operating nature, which can meet the requirements of the prediction of air thermal parameters in unexploited region of high temperature mines."}]}]}]}}
