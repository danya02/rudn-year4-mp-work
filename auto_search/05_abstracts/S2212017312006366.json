In order to make it possible and to facilitate transmission of IPv6 packets over low powered networks, 6LoWPAN [2,3] has been introduced. In this paper, we study mobility issues and scenarios which may occur in the 6LoWPAN network. We also propose an approach to manage the mobility of nodes efficiently based on received signal strength and link quality. Simple load-balancing technique is also incorporated. The 6LoWPAN based Wireless Sensor Network can be integrated with grid computing establishing a Sensor-Grid which may also be used in various applications."}]}]}]}}
