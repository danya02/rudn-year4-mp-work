In this paper a hybrid approach is presented to generate abstract summary in which sentences are clustered using sentence level relationships among sentences in association with Markov clustering principle. Then sentence ranking is done in each cluster and if possible the top weighted sentence of each cluster is fused using some linguistic rules with its best-fit sentence(if found) within that cluster to generate a new sentence. Then top ranked sentences from each cluster are compressed using classification technique to generate the abstract summary. The proposed system is evaluated with DUC 2002 data set and the result is performing better than other existing systems."}]}]}]}}
