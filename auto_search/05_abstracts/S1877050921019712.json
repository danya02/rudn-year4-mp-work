However, industrial applications require, most of the time, high reliability close to 100% and low end-to-end delays. This corresponds to very challenging objectives in wireless (lossy) environments. This delay can be disastrous in time-sensitive industrial IoT deployments where immediate detection and actions impact security, safety, and machine failures. With an efficient MAC protocol, data will be provided quickly to enable the IoT to be fully effective for mission-critical applications. Efficient medium sharing is even more difficult in IIoT due to ultra-low latency, high reliability, and high quality of service (QoS) compared to best-effort for IoT. This article does not survey all existing MAC protocols for IoTs, which was already done in other works. The goal of this paper is to analyze existing MAC protocols that are more suitable for IIoT."}]}]}]}}
