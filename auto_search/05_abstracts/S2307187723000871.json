In this paper, a new word sense disambiguation system is proposed, which integrates rich features and distributed discrimination algorithm, and constructs a method for learning on fuzzy annotations, which can effectively learn from sparse and uncertain annotations. The algorithm considers the elementary components in ascending order concerning their ambiguity degrees, which learns a concept labeler with promising performance with only an inventory extracted from an ontology. Experiments show that the performance of the algorithm significantly outperforms the intuitive generative unsupervised method with the same linguistic resource."}]}]}]}}
