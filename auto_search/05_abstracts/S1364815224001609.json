To gain insight in the speed improvements for operational applications, we connected the improved code to ECMWF\u2019s Fields Database to allow for on-the-fly pre-processing of the forcing, which accelerated the entire forecasting chain. In the original wflow_sbm implementation, run times increased when more than eight threads were used due to Julia\u2019s native threading overhead. Now, run times are 2 to 11 times faster, depending on the chosen routing scheme, number of threads and catchment size. We show the advantages of the improvements in a test setup where ECMWF forecasts and 35 years of ERA5 reanalysis data were used to force wflow_sbm models at 1x1 km spatial resolution for Europe. The attained speedup allows for using distributed hydrological models in large-scale hydrological forecasting and climate-change applications, which is currently often limited to lumped models."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e679", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e680"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e682", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e683", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e685"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e686"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e689", "view": "all"}, "_": "Improved multi-threaded scaling of the distributed hydrological model wflow_sbm."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e691"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e694", "view": "all"}, "_": "Two to eleven times faster run times on high-performance computing clusters."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e696"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e699", "view": "all"}, "_": "Distributed hydrological model application for large-scale hydrological forecasting."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
