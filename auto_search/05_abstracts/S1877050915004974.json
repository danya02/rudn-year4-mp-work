The workload of nodes may varies depends on position and mobility of each involved nodes. In mobile environment, the unreachable information, packet drops and link failure influence for the requirement of new protocol. The protocol needs to monitor the network which aims at topological changes and workload of each node. This paper we have considered the problem of determining the reachability of node in the network stimulate into the enhancement of its transmission. So, we propose an Enhanced Ant Colony method (EAC) for such critical node in mobile WSNs by considering mobility as a key metric. It optimizes the routing paths, providing an effective reliable data path transmission for acquiring reliable communications in the case of critical node. The main goal is to maintain the maximum lifetime of network, during data transmission in an efficient manner. This paper contributes the implementation of this work and makes a comparison of its performance with AODV routing protocol based on packet delivery ratio, throughput, jitter, delay and energy level."}]}]}]}}
