Therefore, a fuzzy retrieval algorithm for film and television animation resource database based on deep neural network is designed. According to the structure of the film and television animation resource base and the static and dynamic characteristics of the color, texture and shape of the film and television animation, the deep neural network is used to supervise and learn the multi-layer neural network of the film and television animation and extract the characteristics of the film and television animation. The improved fuzzy C-means is used for feature clustering analysis. According to the results of feature clustering analysis, the fast sorting algorithm and Top-k sorting algorithm are used to obtain the retrieval results of the film and television animation resource library, and improve the retrieval accuracy of the film and television animation resource library. The experiment shows that using the 7th layer features of deep neural networks for animation resource retri of 90.15%. Therefore, this algorithm eval has the highest recall rate of 98% and the highest average precision rate meets the retrieval requirements of film and television animation resource libraries and can significantly improve the comprehensive performance of film and television animation resource library retrieval."}]}]}]}}
