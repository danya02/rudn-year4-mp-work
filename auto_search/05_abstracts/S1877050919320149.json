Multi-view learning is to combine multiple view data of the same entity for data classification, thereby improving learning performance. Previous multi-view research methods mainly concentrate on the relationship between different data views for classification problems. However, when the data is in high dimensions, it is necessary to perform feature selection in the multi-view data classification process. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-view Support Vector Machine Classification with Feature Selection (MSVMCFS) algorithm, which can not only classify multi-view data, but also select features for each view data in the process of classification. In the model, feature selection is performed by the "}, {"#name": "bold", "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "l"}]}, {"#name": "inf", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "1"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " norm sparsity regularization, and consistency and complementarity between the two views are maintained.
