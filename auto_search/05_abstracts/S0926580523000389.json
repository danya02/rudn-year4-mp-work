Current technologies, such as relational databases, have difficulty in efficiently and effectively managing and querying the interconnected building information with full of hidden relationships. To address this problem, this study adopted the graph-theory-based graph database technology to reveal hidden relationships within building information. A model-driven approach was developed to enable a full conversion of Industry Foundation Classes data into labeled property graph, which is referred to as IFC-Graph. The result shows that IFC-Graph can represent interconnected building information and reveal hidden relationships, supporting effective and efficient building information access and query. This study can benefit a vast number of future studies in the area of building information query by improving its accessibility and queryability."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0220", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0090"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0135"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0135", "view": "all"}, "_": "A new graphical representation was developed for IFC data, IFC-Graph."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0140"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0140", "view": "all"}, "_": "An automatic conversion from IFC data to IFC-Graph was realized."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0145"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0145", "view": "all"}, "_": "IFC-Graph can facilitate building information access and query."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
