These effects are more significant in Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs), and, particularly, in those based on the IEEE 802.15.5 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN mesh) standard, a promising solution for enabling low-power WMSNs. The first contribution of this paper is a quantitative evaluation of these problems under the IEEE 802.15.5 Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode, which is intended for asynchronous data-collection applications. The results obtained show a sharp deterioration of the network performance. Therefore, this paper also reviews the most relevant approaches that cope with these problems and are compatible with ASES. Finally, a set of these proposals is assessed to find out those more suitable for their potential integration with ASES, which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0080", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0380", "view": "all"}, "_": "The hidden and exposed effects are assessed on Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs)."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0385", "view": "all"}, "_": "Performance evaluation reveals a clear negative impact on WMSNs."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0390", "view": "all"}, "_": "Different scientific proposals are discussed in order to mitigate these problems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0395", "view": "all"}, "_": "Some of these proposals are stressed and compared according to WMSN premises."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0400", "view": "all"}, "_": "Best solutions of our comparative study are shown to the audience."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
