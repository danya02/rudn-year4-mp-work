Using our unique methodology we illustrate simplified search and discovery on dengue information derived from distributed resources and aggregated according to dengue ontology. Furthermore we apply data mining to the instantiated ontology to elucidate trends in the mentions of dengue serotypes in scientific abstracts since 1974."}]}]}]}]}}
