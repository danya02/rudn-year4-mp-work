A known issue on e-learning is all the content\u2019s being online and less face-to-face communication than traditional learning; this brings the problem of chasing student\u2019s success, and advising and managing student\u2019s way of studying. Hence, a recent hot topic, data mining, can be applied on student\u2019s data left on e-learning portals to guide the instructor and advisors to help students\u2019 being more successful. Recent researches done on this topic showed that e-learning combined with data mining can decrease the gap between itself and traditional learning \u2014 referred as semantic web mining in general."}]}]}]}}
