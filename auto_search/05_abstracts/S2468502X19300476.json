Topic modeling is an effective tool to extract semantic information from taxi trajectory data. However, previous methods generally ignore trajectory directions that are important in the analysis of movement patterns. In this paper, we employ the bigram topic model rather than traditional topic models to analyze textualized trajectories and consider the direction information of trajectories. We further propose a modified Apriori algorithm to extract topical sub-trajectories and use them to represent each topic. Finally, we design a visual analytics system with several linked views to facilitate users to interactively explore movement patterns from topics and topical sub-trajectories. The case studies with Chengdu taxi trajectory data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system."}]}]}]}}
