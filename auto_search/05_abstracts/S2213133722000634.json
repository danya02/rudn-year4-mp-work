It is built on top of a novel architecture based on framing user tasks as microservices \u2013 independent and self-contained units \u2013 which allows to fully support custom and user-defined software packages, libraries and environments. These include complete remote desktop and GUI applications, besides common analysis environments as the Jupyter Notebooks. Rosetta relies on Open Container Initiative containers, which allow for safe, effective and reproducible code execution; can use a number of container engines and runtimes; and seamlessly supports several workload management systems, thus enabling containerized workloads on a wide range of computing resources. Although developed in the astronomy and astrophysics space, Rosetta can virtually support any science and technology domain where resource-intensive, interactive data analysis is required."}]}]}]}}
