Integrating high-level behavioral and low-level control has capital significance for their implementation and is still a challenge. In the field of high-level behavior, Petri nets are widely applied for modeling, simulating, and analyzing concurrent, discrete-event and knowledge-based systems, furthermore even models are used as basis for control algorithm, direct controlling devices\u2019 behavioral with high-level Petri nets is little diffused. This paper presents a control architecture used to integrate models in high-level Petri nets with IoT-based devices. Operational tests were provided using CPN Tools and micro-controlled physical devices. A study with a mobile robot is shown and results indicate the reasonability and applicability of this proposed approach in IoT-based devices."}]}]}]}}
