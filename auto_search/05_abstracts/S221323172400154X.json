The involvement of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of excitotoxicity remains elusive. Transcriptome analysis has revealed that cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels are associated with susceptibility to ferroptosis-inducing compounds. Here we show that exogenous NADPH, besides being reductant, interacts with N-myristoyltransferase 2 (NMT2) and upregulates the N-myristoylated ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1). NADPH increases membrane-localized FSP1 and strengthens resistance to ferroptosis. Arg-291 of NMT2 is critical for the NADPH-NMT2-FSP1 axis-mediated suppression of ferroptosis. This study suggests that NMT2 plays a pivotal role by bridging NADPH levels and neuronal susceptibility to ferroptosis. We propose a mechanism by which the NADPH regulates N-myristoylation, which has important implications for ferroptosis and disease treatment."}]}]}]}}
