The network performance is characterized as a function of the message load for various values of the network and communication parameters. An exact analytical expression for the saturation point has been obtained. The method of statistical physics known as the mean field theory approximation has been used in order to derive analytical expressions of latency as a function of message generation rate for the full range of the network load. The saturation point has been found proportional to the number of the torus dimensions and inversely proportional to the message length and to the length of the path from the source to the destination. It was found that the transition to the saturation state is a second-order (continuous) phase transition with a critical exponent equal to 1."}]}]}]}}
