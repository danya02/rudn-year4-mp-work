Basically, the time efficiency indicates how fast the algorithm runs. In this paper, the Trust Computing algorithm has been analyzed mathematically to find the time complexity of the algorithm currently chosen and hence achieved trusted communication and high packet delivery ratio of data transmission among the Vehicular Adhoc Networks. We could confirm that the ONSRP is optimal by comparing it to the Scalable Hybrid Routing (SHR) communication overhead and packet delivery ratio of the network from both analysis and simulation in the presence of link failures."}]}]}]}}
