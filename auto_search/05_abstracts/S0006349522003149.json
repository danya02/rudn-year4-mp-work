In many cases, the same intracellular signaling molecules interact with more than one type of RTK. How signals from different RTKs retain the identity of the triggering receptor and how (or if) different receptors may synergize or compete remain largely unknown. Here we utilize an experimental strategy, combining microscale patterning and single-molecule imaging, to measure the competition between ephrin-A1:EphA2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF):EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand-receptor complexes for the shared downstream signaling molecules, Grb2 and SOS. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy, in which newly formed EGF:EGFR complexes outcompete ephrin-A1:EphA2 for Grb2 and SOS, revealing a type of negative crosstalk interaction fundamentally controlled by chemical mass action and protein copy number limitations."}]}]}]}}
