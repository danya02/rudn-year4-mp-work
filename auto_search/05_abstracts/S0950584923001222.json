High-quality datasets are essential for the realization of data value. This survey article summarizes the research direction of dataset quality in machine learning, including the definition of related concepts, analysis of quality issues and risks, and a review of dataset quality dimensions and metrics throughout the dataset lifecycle and a review of dataset quality metrics analyzed from a dataset lifecycle perspective and summarized in literatures. Furthermore, this article introduces a comprehensive quality evaluation process, which includes a framework for dataset quality evaluation with dimensions and metrics, computation methods for quality metrics, and assessment models. These studies provide valuable guidance for evaluating dataset quality in the field of machine learning, which can help improve the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization ability of machine learning models, and promote the development and application of artificial intelligence technology."}]}]}]}}
