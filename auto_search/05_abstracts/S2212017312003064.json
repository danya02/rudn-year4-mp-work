Based on the expected load on each virtual link, the channel assignment strategy assigns channels to the multi radio network interfaces. In this paper, we propose a centralized rank based channel assignment algorithm. The traffic aware metric (WCETT) is used in routing protocol to provide the quality of service (QoS). The proposed centralized rank based channel assignment scheme is based on a rank function. The rank of each node is computed based on the aggregate traffic, weighted cumulative expected transmission time (WCETT) from the gateway, and the number of NICs per node. The proposed channel assignment algorithm can improve the network throughput and utilization of channel to a large extent. The results in the simulator (NS2) show that the proposed algorithm attains the high network throughput and utilization of channels."}]}]}]}}
