Nowadays, 5G technology provides incremental improvements over Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks resulting in the enhancement of civilian communications. Considering enormous possible applications of this new technology, it is feasible to use them in military utilities. The authors want to introduce the most important aspects related to the 5G system vulnerability in the context of its use in military scenarios. We also present a quality analysis of adequate solutions for 5G to mitigate the jamming and improve the system immunity. The description of use case scenarios depicts how 5G applications can fit in typical use cases."}]}]}]}}
