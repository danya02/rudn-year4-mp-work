A wireframe model structure is established in the form of a semantic mesh, which allows you to control deviation by establishing the spectrum of possible hops on the way to achieving the generic concepts. The use of scaling to reflect the dynamics of information processes that represent data is shown. By varying the degree of generality of the scales used, the desired level of abstracting the semantic mesh is achieved. A representative example of a stepwise transition from a specific individual semantic mesh based on using the content of a subject area to an abstract semantic mesh that controls general information processes is constructed. The resulting conceptual model supports a scaled conceptual dependency on the generic and derived concepts. To map on a generalized semantic mesh with nodes in the form of variable domains, a mapper-adapter is required."}]}]}]}}
