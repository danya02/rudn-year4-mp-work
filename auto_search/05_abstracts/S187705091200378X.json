NDT is a technique that allows the examination of material properties without causing any damage to the material in the process. A wireless sensor network facilitates the collaborative effort to monitor a certain aspect without the need for expensive wired infrastructures. In this paper we describe the system architecture of a NDT system that is ultra low power, low cost, easy to use, and autonomously integrates into our WSN platform to collaboratively monitor the status conditions of industrial equipment. Our system was successfully deployed to monitor the thickness of a compound-metal (tungsten and steel) sheets used in vibration screens, which are utilized in the harsh industrial environments of the Oil-Sands, located in northern Alberta, Canada. The integration of the two technologies, WSN-based NDT, will bring about new applications in the field of low cost wireless material examination in real-time."}]}]}]}}
