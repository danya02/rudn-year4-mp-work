It offers the advantage of portability over old embedded system (tape-based recording systems). The paper focus on: how we implemented algorithms to analyze heart beat rate signals in real-time, how to fusion data of different sensors mainly here temperature and blood pressure and to transmit the data via radio frequency (Xbee module). Then explain a web server application for healthcare givers to access the data. In addition, it allows doctors to get the heart beat rate file of the patient by email every twenty four hours. It can also be used to control patients or athletic person over a long period. The system reads, stores and analyses the heart beat rate signals, body temperature repetitively in real-time. The hardware and software design are oriented towards a single-chip microcontroller-based system, hence minimizing the size. The important features of this paper are the implementation of extremums and energy in the algorithm to compute patient heart rate and detect any anomaly within the P wav in ECG signal. The first tests were encouraging."}]}]}]}}
