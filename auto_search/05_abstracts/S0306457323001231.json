While moving, the agents observe events and exchange the information collected with other agents encountered: to this end, they use messaging systems purposely adapted to use point-to-point network connections to allow local data exchange between agents even when global network connections are not available. As is common in Delay Tolerant Networks, exchanged messages are locally stored: when a global network is available, the agents can upload all the information collected by themselves and other agents they encountered to a Control Room or a database in the Cloud. Differently from traditional DTN algorithms such as Epidemic and Spray&Wait, we propose a solution that keeps track of agents that shared information along the path and assess the quality of the information collected by multiple agents through a reputation-based mechanism that is safer than majority voting. A simulator compatible with OpenStreetMap is presented, as well as simulated experiments in two Italian towns to validate the feasibility of the approach."}]}]}]}}
