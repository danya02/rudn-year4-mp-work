Even though the simulation shows some difference between the results from an original network and those in its corresponding downsized networks in a wide range of network sizes and traffic patterns, the difference is acceptable since it has minimal values of 1% in most cases and maximum values of 10% in a very few cases. We also present the effectiveness of both the downsizing model and the downsizing-model-based simulation in comparison with other performance models and simulation techniques. As the size and complexity of wireless networks are increasing nowadays, we vision that the new proposed model will be of great advantage in conducting fast and accurate packet-level wireless simulations, as well as being a helpful tool for performing the numerically tractable theoretical studies for extensive performance evaluations, such as determining the network-wide throughput or end-to-end delays."}]}]}]}]}}
