The dataset contains 18 diverse features categorized into metadata, primary content, engagement statistics, and labels for individual videos from 58 Bangla YouTube channels. A rigorous preprocessing step has been applied to denoise, deduplicate, and remove bias from the features, ensuring unbiased and reliable analysis. As the largest and most robust clickbait corpus in Bangla to date, this dataset provides significant value for natural language processing and data science researchers seeking to advance modeling of clickbait phenomena in low-resource languages. Its multi-modal nature allows for comprehensive analyses of clickbait across content, user interactions, and linguistic dimensions to develop more sophisticated detection methods with cross-linguistic applications."}]}]}]}}
