The software allows automatic extraction of 18 technical criteria, and manual input of 12 visual criteria, to calculate the PI-QUAL score. We collected 100 prostate MRI datasets from four MR device manufacturers to test data compatibility, automatic sequence recognition, and robustness of technical criteria extraction from DICOM data. The main issue was to determine the spatial resolution in the phase and frequency directions, due to variable encoding of the DICOM datasets."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st020"}, "_": "Results"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Acquisition data could be extracted from all sample examinations (100%), with a median analysis speed of 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4 images per second and mean processing time of 96 [11\u2013326] seconds per examination.
