Through the design of the system workflow and system modules, the crawler method is selected and improved according to the actual situation. And combined with the intelligent matching of pesticide information, the Online Pesticide Information Center and Discovery Platform is designed and implemented. The platform unifies the standard of retrieval entrance, integrates all kinds of pesticide information needed by researchers, and provides powerful decision support for researchers helping them with the rational design of pesticides."}]}]}]}}
