To aid less skilled users, a methodology and algorithm are proposed that, through identification of specific word categories in patents, analysis of term-term correlation data, and data mining techniques, automatically identify similar products, and properties relating or differentiating products. This algorithm can quantifiably guide creativity efforts and aid in patent portfolio management."}]}]}]}}
