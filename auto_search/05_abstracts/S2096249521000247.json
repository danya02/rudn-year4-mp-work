The technology gets evaluated by its power consumption and compactness to afford a better solution to real-world problems with better sophistication to adopt a modernized wireless world. Among that, the IoT (Internet of Things) technology plays a predominant role by combining with Artificial Intelligence to optimize and revolute the characterization of data communication. When the data communication is initiated, the main contributor to the transmission is the miniaturized antenna holding different types in its structure and processing. It acquires the required radio spectrum channel with the advanced multi coding modulating technique by utilizing token ring mesh topology for the data transfer with acquired data channels. This chapter describes the design and fabrication of a miniaturized antenna using MEMS technology (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) and its different types using INTELLISUITE software to get suited for better communication in oil pipelines. Based on the application, it also enumerates the choices of micro or nanoantennas with its specification upholding data adopting techniques with modulation schemes to support IoT applications."}]}]}]}}
