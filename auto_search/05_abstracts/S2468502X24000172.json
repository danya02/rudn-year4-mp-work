The main challenge lies in IM algorithm evaluation, due to the complexity and diversity of the spreading processes of different IM algorithms in different hypergraphs. Existing evaluation methods mainly leverage statistical metrics, such as influence spread, to quantify overall performance, but do not fully unravel spreading characteristics and patterns. In this paper, we propose an exploratory visual analytics system, IMVis, to assist users in exploring and evaluating IM algorithms at the overview, pattern, and node levels. A spreading pattern mining method is first proposed to characterize spreading processes and extract important spreading patterns to facilitate efficient analysis and comparison of IM algorithms. Novel visualization glyphs are designed to comprehensively reveal both temporal and structural features of IM algorithms\u2019 spreading processes in hypergraphs at multiple levels. The effectiveness and usefulness of IMVis are demonstrated through two case studies and expert interviews."}]}]}]}}
