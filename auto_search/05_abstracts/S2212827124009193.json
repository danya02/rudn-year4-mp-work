The ability to meet production specifications within agreed time and cost constraints is crucial in satisfying customer demands. Therefore, effective monitoring of production activities is essential. In order to track production activities, this research proposes a Production Activity Control Framework using the Cyber-Physical Production System. The proposed framework enables precise monitoring of 1) machine activities, which include idle, setup, and processing times, and 2) operator activities, such as productive and idle times. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was tested and validated in the make-to-order industry. Its implementation demonstrates the ability to enhance control over the production schedule and direct manufacturing costs. With the proposed framework, the evaluation of operator and machining costs can be performed accurately, as opposed to the traditional production activity control activities in the make-to-order, which relies on estimates or an aggregate approach."}]}]}]}}
