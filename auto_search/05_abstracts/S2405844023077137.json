Despite the advancements in management systems, researchers find that mathematical knowledge remains one of the most challenging to manage due to the latter's inherent heterogeneity. One novel recourse being explored is variable typing where current works remain preliminary and, thus, provide a wide room for contribution. In this study, a primordial attempt to implement the end-to-end Entity Recognition (ER) and Relation Extraction (RE) approach to variable typing was made using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. A micro-dataset was developed for this process. According to our findings, the ER model and RE model, respectively, have Precision of 0.8142 and 0.4919, Recall of 0.7816 and 0.6030, and F1-Scores of 0.7975 and 0.5418. Despite the limited dataset, the models performed at par with values in the literature. This work also discusses the factors affecting this BERT-based approach, giving rise to suggestions for future implementations."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The BERT-based transformer was finetuned using a locally developed micro-dataset."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Variable Typing was refined and extended by concatenating Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction"}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
