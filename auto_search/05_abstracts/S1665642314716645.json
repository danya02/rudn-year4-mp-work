This study integrates the concept of context-aware with association algorithms to establish the context-aware recommendation systems (CARS). The CARS contains three modules and provides the product recommendations for users with their smartphone. First, the simple RSSI Indoor localization module (SRILM) locates the user position and detects the context information surrounding around users. Second, the Apriori recommendation module (ARM) provides effective recommended product information for users through association rules mining. The appropriate product information can be received effectiveness and greatly enhanced the recommendation service."}]}]}]}}
