One of the major issue of WSNs is development of energy efficient routing protocols. Clustering is an effective way to increase energy efficiency. Mostly, heterogenous protocols consider two or three energy level of nodes. In reality, heterogonous WSNs contain large range of energy levels. By analyzing communication energy consumption of the clusters and large range of energy levels in heterogenous WSN, we propose BEENISH (Balanced Energy Efficient Network Integrated Super Heterogenous) Protocol. It assumes WSN containing four energy levels of nodes. Here, Cluster Heads (CHs) are elected on the bases of residual energy level of nodes. Simulation results show that it performs better than existing clustering protocols in heterogeneous WSNs. Our protocol achieve longer stability, lifetime and more effective messages than Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC), Developed DEEC (DDEEC) and Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC)."}]}]}]}}
