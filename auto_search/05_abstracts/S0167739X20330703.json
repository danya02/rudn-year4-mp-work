Much of that data has localized and ephemeral interest, but can be of great use if shared among co-located devices. However, mobile devices often experience poor connectivity, leading to availability issues if application storage and logic are fully delegated to a remote cloud infrastructure. In turn, the edge computing paradigm pushes computations and storage beyond the data center, closer to end-user devices where data is generated and consumed, enabling the execution of certain components of edge-enabled systems directly and cooperatively on edge devices. In this article, we address the challenge of supporting reliable and efficient data storage and dissemination among co-located wireless mobile devices without resorting to centralized services or network infrastructures. We propose "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "Thyme"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", a novel time-aware reactive data storage system for pervasive edge computing environments, that exploits synergies between the storage substrate and the publish/subscribe paradigm.
