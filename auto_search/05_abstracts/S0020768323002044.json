We decompose the three-dimensional (3D) description of a slender structure into a macroscale problem solving for the deformation of the beam center-line (based on an effective strain energy density, which depends on the stretching, bending, and torsional strains of the beam\u2019s center-line) and a series of two-dimensional (2D) microscale boundary value problems (defined over the beam cross-section). We solve a series of 2D problems (covering a range of macroscopic strain combinations) for a given cross-sectional geometry and material distribution in an offline, pre-processing step. Using this pre-computed energy landscape, we solve the macroscopic boundary value problem within a geometrically exact, nonlinear discrete beam framework. We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach through a set of benchmark problems highlighting the nonlinear effects of the cross-sectional geometry and constitutive material, including material heterogeneity and pre-strains. We further illustrate how this technique is applied to truss-based architected materials consisting of networks of slender struts, which are typically made of polymeric base materials and thus allow for large nonlinear elastic deformation."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1250", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1251"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1253", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1254", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1256"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1257"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1260", "view": "all"}, "_": "Two-scale numerical framework for modeling hyperelastic slender beams."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1262"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1265", "view": "all"}, "_": "The microscale cross-sectional problem is split from the macroscale beam BVP."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1267"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1270", "view": "all"}, "_": "Geometric and material nonlinearity, pre-strains and heterogeneous cross-sections."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1272"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1275", "view": "all"}, "_": "Successful application to beams and truss-based metamaterials."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
