Short query paths, small routing tables, and robustness constitute the most prominent design objectives for the overlay topology. In this paper, we introduce a general group theoretic method and define a new Cayley graph. We then use these constructs to derive a novel wireless overlay structure. WCayleyCCC, our proposed overlay network, has many desirable features, including short query paths, compact routing tables, high clustering, and robustness. Because of its symmetry, our design offers simpler routing (searching) and several other desirable properties compared with many previously proposed wireless overlay networks, such as MChord. Performance evaluation results, reported in this paper, quantify the advantages of WCayleyCCC in terms of query path length, routing table size, clustering, and robustness relative to some recent proposals. WCayleyCCC is particularly useful in distributed computing under relatively stable conditions such as wireless mesh networks."}]}]}]}}
