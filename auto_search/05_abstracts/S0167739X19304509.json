This paper addresses the problem of age prediction from Twitter dataset, where the prediction issue is viewed as a classification task. For this purpose, an innovative model based on Convolutional Neural Network is devised. To this end, we rely on language-related features and social media specific metadata. More specifically, we introduce two features that have not been previously considered in the literature: the content of URLs and hashtags appearing in tweets. We also employ distributed representations of words and phrases present in tweets, hashtags and URLs, pre-trained on appropriate corpora in order to exploit their semantic information in age prediction. We show that our CNN-based classifier, when compared with baseline models, yields an improvement of up to 12.3% for Dutch dataset, 9.8% for English1 dataset, and 6.6% for English2 dataset in the micro-averaged F1 score."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e1907"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1908"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1910"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1911"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1913"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1914"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1917"}, "_": "The paper addresses age prediction from Twitter dataset using language features and network metadata."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1919"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1922"}, "_": "Two new features related to content of URLs and Hashtags have been incorporated."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1924"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1927"}, "_": "A new convolution neural network architecture is put forward and assessed."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
