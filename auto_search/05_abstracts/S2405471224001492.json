For protein kinases, substrates may have full or only partial matches to the kinase recognition motif, a property known as \u201csubstrate quality.\u201d However, it is not clear whether differences in substrate quality represent neutral variation or if they have functional consequences. We examine this question for the kinase CK2, which has many fundamental functions. We show that optimal CK2 sites are phosphorylated at maximal stoichiometries and found in many conditions, whereas minimal substrates are more weakly phosphorylated and have regulatory functions. Optimal CK2 sites tend to be more conserved, and substrate quality is often tuned by selection. For intermediate sites, increases or decreases in substrate quality may be deleterious, as we demonstrate for a CK2 substrate at the kinetochore. The results together suggest a strong role for substrate quality in phosphosite function and evolution.
