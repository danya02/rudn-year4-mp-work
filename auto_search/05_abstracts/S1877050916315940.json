The main objective of WSN is to sense the crucial information from the environment depending on the type of application for which it is deployed and send this information to its Base Station(BS) so that it can take corrective action. These Sensor Nodes ommunicate with each other through various protocols. The problem of the conventional method is, during gathering of sensed data each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station for which it will deplete its power quickly. In this project, we propose PEGASIS(Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System),a near optimal chain-based protocol for extending the lifetime of network. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbour, performing a chain, elect a leader from the chain who collects the data from the neighbours to be transmitted to the base station. As a result the average energy spend by each node per round is reduced and to lower the bandwidth requirement. By using certain algorithm we can propose the shortest path of transmission of data to the base station. As a result less power consumption can be achieved to increase efficiency and life time of the network."}]}]}]}}
