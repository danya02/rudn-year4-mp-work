A lot of industrial applications do not require real-time acquisition and uses low data rates, but some scenarios, such as the condition monitoring systems and the control processes require higher data rates (i.e. tens of kHz). General purpose wireless solutions do not compliant industrial standards. This paper discusses the potential of UWB technology for realizing use cases in industry 4.0 and shows the implementation of an UWB sensor network for machine vibration monitoring that is able to acquire and transmit (6.8Mbit/s data rate) accelerometric measures sampled up to 32KHz with a maximum Packet Loss Rate (PLR) of 2.44%. It also shows as UWB could be a valid instrument to connect cloud computing and edge computing even for real time extraction of diagnostic and prognostic features from high-frequency signals. Different experiments have been performed in an industrial and laboratory environment to evaluate the performance of UWB radio for communication in a wireless sensor network."}]}]}]}}
