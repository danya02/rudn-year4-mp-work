Our system is constituted by an Irregular Convolutional Coded Unity Rate Coded Space Time Trellis Coded M-ary Phase Shift Keying (IrCC-URC-STTC-MPSK) scheme invoked for exploiting the benefits of MIMO systems. The system is designed with the aid of Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for approaching the corresponding channel capacity in fast fading environments. The proposed scheme exhibits substantial benefits over conventional MIMO systems in hostile wireless channels."}]}]}]}}
