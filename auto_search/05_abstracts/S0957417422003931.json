In this study, a novel query-by-document approach using Monte-Carlo sampling of relevant keywords is presented. From a set of input documents (seed) keywords are extracted using TF-IDF and subsequently sampled to repeatedly construct queries to the database. The occurrence of returned documents is counted and serves as a proxy relevance metric. Two case studies based on the Scopus\u00ae database are used to demonstrate the method and its key advantages. No expert knowledge and human intervention is needed to construct the final search strings which reduces the human bias. The methods practicality is supported by the high re-retrieval of seed documents of 7/8 and 26/31 in high ranks in the two presented case studies."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e913"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e914"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e916"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e917"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e919"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e920"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e923"}, "_": "Presentation of novel query-by-document approach."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e925"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e928"}, "_": "Incorporation of statistical Monte-Carlo sampling method in query construction step."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e930"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e933"}, "_": "Document (appearance) frequency is used as method inherent relevance ranking metric."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e935"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e938"}, "_": "Comparison of methodology with sequential sampling and expert string construction."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e940"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e943"}, "_": "High seed recall in retrieved corpora."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
