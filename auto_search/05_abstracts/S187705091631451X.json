Imagining that the devices in the world are going to perform tasks together, the non-trivial issue is the energy efficient connectivity and communication. In this context, we propose a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm for Dynamic and Heterogeneous Internet of Things. The proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated on actual IoT platform. The parameters like network coverage, communication cost and power consumption analysis are carried out by conducting experiments on IoT based simulator."}]}]}]}}
