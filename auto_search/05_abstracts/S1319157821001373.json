However, a user\u2019s search task can be complex and may not be expressed using a single search query, requiring the user to write several queries to fulfill all the aspects of his or her needs. In such scenarios, an intelligent search system would be beneficial to identify and understand the original search task issued by a user and then suggest several search tasks (in a form of key-phrases or short topics) related to the original search task. Aiming to tackle this limitation, this paper proposes a framework for applying several unsupervised learning approaches, including topic modeling and log mining. The results of applying these approaches to large user session data show that, indeed, these approaches would be applicable in search suggestion and task recommendation, reaching a significant improvement over a strong baseline."}]}]}]}}
