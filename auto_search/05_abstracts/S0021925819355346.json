To address the fate of plasma membrane-localized KCa2.3, we utilized an extracellular epitope-tagged channel in combination with fluorescence and biotinylation techniques in both human embryonic kidney cells and the human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. KCa2.3 was internalized from the plasma membrane and degraded with a time constant of 18 h. Cell surface biotinylation demonstrated that KCa2.3 was rapidly endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane. Consistent with recycling, expression of a dominant negative (DN) RME-1 or Rab35 as well as wild type EPI64C, the Rab35 GTPase-activating protein, resulted in accumulation of KCa2.3 in an intracellular compartment. Expression of DN RME-1, DN Rab35, or wild type EPI64C resulted in a decrease in steady-state plasma membrane expression. Knockdown of EPI64C increased cell surface expression of KCa2.3. Furthermore, the effect of EPI64C was dependent upon its GTPase-activating proteins activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed an association between KCa2.3 and both Rab35 and RME-1. In contrast to KCa2.3, KCa3.1 was rapidly endocytosed and degraded in an RME-1 and Rab35-independent manner.
