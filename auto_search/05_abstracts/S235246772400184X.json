Not only is the overall transport feasibility assessed, but also possible operating conditions in terms of pressures, flows and velocities. To that end, two data sets for the network topology by 2025 and 2030 were created. A heuristic, semi-random nomination generation is employed to generate 100 consistent steady-state source\u2013sink nominations for both years, based on collected production/consumption bounds. The authors employ a so-called nomination-validation model (MILP-formulation) for the solution of the resulting transport problem(s). For the evaluation of pipeline flow velocities, the authors combine those solutions with a hypothesis on limiting flow speeds suggested in a German technical journal. The analysis exhibits feasibility among all generated nominations with respect to flows and admissible velocities."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e3854", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e3855"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e3857", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e3858", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e3860"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3861"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e3864", "view": "all"}, "_": "Transport feasibility of initial German hydrogen network is assessed (2025/2030)."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3866"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e3869", "view": "all"}, "_": "Balanced nominations are synthesized via random sampling and optimization techniques."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3871"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e3874", "view": "all"}, "_": "Initial operating conditions do not challenge the network."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e3876"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e3879", "view": "all"}, "_": "Likely future bottlenecks are identified."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
