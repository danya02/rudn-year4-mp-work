This view is challenged when delays caused by communication with the back-end become an obstacle for IoT applications with, for example, stringent timing constraints. In contrast, Fog Computing approaches, where devices communicate and orchestrate their operations collectively and closer to the origin of data, lack adequate tools for programming secure interactions between humans and their proximate devices at the network edge. This paper fills the gap by applying Action-Oriented Programming\u00a0(AcOP) model for this task.
