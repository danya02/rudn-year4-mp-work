We propose a new generic construction, the stellar transformation, that dramatically increases the size of this pool by facilitating the transformation of well-studied topologies from interconnection networks, along with their networking properties and routing algorithms, into viable dual-port server-centric datacenter network topologies. We demonstrate that under our transformation, numerous interconnection networks yield datacenter network topologies with potentially good, and easily computable, baseline properties.
