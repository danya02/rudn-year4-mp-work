There is urgent need for broad antiviral strategies based on host-targets filling gaps between pathogen emergence and availability of therapeutic or preventive strategies. Significant reduction of pathogen titers decreases spread of infections and thereby ensures health systems not being overloaded and public life to continue. Based on previously observed interference with FGFR1/2-signaling dependent impact on interferon stimulated gene (ISG)-expression, we identified Pim kinases as promising druggable cellular target.

Kinome-analysis revealed vast changes in kinase landscape upon AZD1208 treatment, especially for inflammation and the PI3K/Akt-pathway. For ZIKV, a clear correlation between antiviral effect and increase in ISG-expression was observed. Based on a cell culture model with impaired ISG-induction, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis, leading to major changes in the endolysosomal equilibrium, was identified as second pillar of the antiviral effect triggered by AZD1208-dependent Pim kinase inhibition, also against HBV."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "We identified Pim-kinases as cellular target for a broad antiviral activity.
