Methods: Based on the integration platform and big data related technologies, multi-source heterogeneous data are integrated and cleaned to form a scientific research data center. What's more, the scientific research retrieval system is used for high-speed retrieval, analysis and utilization of the data in the scientific research data center. Results: The built scientific research retrieval system has the functions of integrating statistical methods, flexibly configuring statistical indicators, customizing queries, etc., which reduces the pressure of scientific researchers in data collection, statistics and analysis, and improves the statistical analysis quality of scientific research data. Conclusion: It has improved the quality and efficiency of scientific research, accelerated the transformation of scientific research achievements, and indirectly promoted the improvement of medical quality."}]}]}]}}
