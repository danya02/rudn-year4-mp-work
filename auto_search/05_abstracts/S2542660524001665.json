This hybridized approach aims to optimize energy consumption efficiency while ensuring comprehensive network coverage for sensor deployment. The formulation of the network strategy is rooted in empirical data collected from real sensors deployed across two neighboring municipalities within the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil. Specifically, our analysis encompasses 380 strategically positioned sensors throughout Vit\u00f3ria city, all intended for connectivity to a central gateway located in Vila Velha. To establish mesh network clusters, we employed the k-Medoids algorithm for clustering fusion, while the GA with a binary solution was utilized to determine the star network points. In this approach, Dijkstra and genetic algorithms with real solutions are incorporated to facilitate efficient resource allocation within the mesh (utilizing ZigBee) and star (utilizing LoRa) networks. These resource allocation strategies are devised with the overarching objective of minimizing energy consumption. The findings of this investigation demonstrate that through the implementation of planning and resource allocation algorithms, we were able to effectively reduce the number of mesh networks and allocate resources to each designated end-point sensor."}]}]}]}}
