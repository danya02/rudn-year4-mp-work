Syringomyelia is an etiologically diverse affliction caused by disturbance of normal cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics. Lesions are characterized by the formation of tubular cavities in the gray matter of the spinal cord and gliosis; however, the etiology is unknown and treatment methods differ. Many existing studies have focused on the relationship between other diseases and syringomyelia. There is a lack of comprehensive and objective reports on the research status of syringomyelia. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis to quantify studies on Syringomyelia and trending issues in the last 20\u202fyears."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st015"}, "_": "Methods"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Articles were acquired from the Web of Science Core Collection database.

At present, research on syringomyelia is mainly focused on the age of onset, potential therapeutic interventions, surgical treatment, avoidance of recurrence, and delay of pain. The use of surgical treatment of the disease and the mechanism of further treatment are the current hot research topics. The correlation between trauma and congenital factors, translational application, the effect of surgical treatment, postoperative recurrence, and complications are further hot research areas. These may provide ideas for further research into a radical cure for syringomyelia"}]}]}]}}
