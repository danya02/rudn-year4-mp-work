In this paper, we present a terrestrial three-dimensional network architecture as well as protocol stack deployment for static sensor nodes placed at varying heights. A Dynamic Cluster-Based TDMA MAC (DCB-TDMA MAC) protocol has been developed for this network and simulated using Cooja platform. Cluster-Head nodes are rotated based on residual energy in order to maximize the lifetime of the network. Detailed working of protocol involving Time Synchronization, MAC, Cluster-Head rotation, Dynamic Routing is provided in this paper along with simulation results and analysis."}]}]}]}}
