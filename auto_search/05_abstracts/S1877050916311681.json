Thus information extraction from different web documents in the modern day scenario is becoming a real challenge, as one has to cater to format and script variations in documented form and media variations in soft-web form. This has become very relevant in Indian education scenario, where bilingual and multi-lingual communication and web documents through on-line courses, are considered. When regional native dialect comes into picture, another dimension of complexity is added. The present paper focuses on content extraction of such documents through a generic approach using pixel-based approach and mining through classification. Indian bilingual web documents are considered and attribute generation is done through reducing the pixel matrix. Five different attributes were identified and studied. A clear state of art comparison between trained dataset and test dataset is given. The results give reasonable content extraction with good accuracy of the datasets studied."}]}]}]}}
