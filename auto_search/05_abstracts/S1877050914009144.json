In this paper, we describe a wireless sensor network system that we have developed using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The system is low-cost and highly scalable both in terms of the type of sensors and the number of sensor nodes, which makes it well suited for a wide variety of applications related to environmental monitoring. Overall system architecture and the design of hardware and software components are presented in details in this paper. Some sample deployment and measurement results are also presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the system."}]}]}]}}
