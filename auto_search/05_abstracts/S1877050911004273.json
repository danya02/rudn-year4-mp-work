Usually these softwares need lots of memory. There are many examples of objects and people of which would be useful to know the precise locations. Something sent via pony express, position of buses in the city, friends\u2019 locations, and so on. Our purpose is to use connectivity of smartphone to share position via gps by using only a filesystem created ad hoc without databases or user space programs. IFHNFS is based on Hixosfs and NFS (Linux kernel). Indexing the most relevant data directly in the fs structure makes the exchange of data Faster and, via NFS, potentially available whenever and whenever. Ad-hoc solutions for Android have been developed in real contexts. The system have been tested on a network of Android OS devices that share data with a Linux server."}]}]}]}}
