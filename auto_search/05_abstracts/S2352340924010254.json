The dataset includes seven inbred lines as female parents (L) and two testers as male parents (T) with diverse genetic bases and heat tolerance qualities. Fourteen cross combinations were produced through L \u00d7 T (7 \u00d7 2) mating design, involving hybridization between lines ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "f"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") and testers ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "m"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") in a one-to-one fashion. To assess the heterosis of the crosses, all parents (both lines and testers) were included along with the crosses and evaluated in the same experimental field for 16 traits using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with two replications. The line \u00d7 tester analysis estimates the ANOVA, including parents, combining ability, genetic components, and the contribution of parental lines to genetic variation in the hybrids. This dataset is valuable for breeders in subtropical countries to develop efficient breeding strategies for hybrid summer tomato varieties."}]}]}]}]}}
