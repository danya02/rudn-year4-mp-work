A mobile ad hoc network is a self-organized and energetically reconfigurable wireless network without wired infrastructure and central administration. Nodes in the mobile ad hoc network can immediately create a communication structure while each node moves in a random way. Multicasting is capable of performing required services for ad hoc applications. The dynamic nature of the network topology and limited resources, maintaining and finding the path for multicasting data is still further challenging. Several protocols have been designed for multicasting in mobile ad hoc networks. On demand multicast routing protocol is one such protocol. ODMRP is mesh based and on-demand protocol that uses forwarding group to communicate a mesh for each multicasting group. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to find the stable path selection in ODMRP for forwarding packets. The basic on demand multicast routing protocol path selection uses minimum delay principle. The proposed algorithm considers node energy in path selection from source to destination. This article discusses the studies on output parameters such as control overhead and end to end delay by varying the input parameters viz., multicast groups size and mobility in the developed algorithm. Experimental results confirm that this approach can improve stability of path due to node energy consumption."}]}]}]}}
