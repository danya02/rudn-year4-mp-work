Corporate Leaders Analytics and Network System (CLANS) is a system designed to identify and analyze social networks among corporations and business elites. It targets to tackle some of difficult problems such as natural language processing, network construction, relationship mining, and it requires high-quality management of data. For data management, we propose a novel approach by integrating the essential XML files and auxiliary databases, with a flexible and extensible data schema. This data schema is the kernel of our data management. It achieves plenty of superiorities, namely, separability, scalability, traceability, distinguishability, version control and maintainability. In this paper, we specifically illustrate the data schema as well as the management approach in CLANS."}]}]}]}}
