As the classification method, BERT being one of the natural language processing models was employed. Through the comparison between the features of tweets inside and outside a specific space, it was revealed that there were differences between them in terms the number of URLs and media including photographs provided in them and shown that classification accuracy would improve by combining the numbers of URLs and media provided in tweets and their contents. In addition, through the extraction and comparison of words affecting the results of classification using LIME, what types of words and information had impacts on the judgement of classification were visualized."}]}]}]}}
