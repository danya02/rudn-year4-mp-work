The world wide web is a large collection of web/hypertext document, so effort is required to provide relevant data for a given set of query with less response time. This paper implements the semantic-synaptic web mining algorithm, and compares the result with other existing algorithm. The algorithm focuses on use of entropy for finding accurate results for any given query."}]}]}]}}
