We present a routing scheme that is deadlock free, avoids congestions, and can be executed on the fly by bit manipulation of node labels. A methodology for modular construction of these networks yields estimates for the VLSI area required for their layout. Fault-tolerance properties are analyzed, a vulner-ability of 1 is proved, and fault-handling abilities in presence of faulty nodes or links are demonstrated. We also show how several classes of parallel algorithms can be efficiently implemented using these networks."}]}]}]}}
