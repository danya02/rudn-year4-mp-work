Technological advancements, particularly in commercially available Active Assisted Living devices, offer a promising alternative. These readily accessible products, ranging from smartwatches to home automation systems, are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence capabilities that can monitor health metrics, predict adverse events, and facilitate a safer living environment. However, there is no review exploring how Artificial Intelligence has been integrated into commercially available Active Assisted Living technologies, and how these devices monitor health metrics and provide healthcare solutions in a real-world environment for healthy aging.

The primary application goal of Artificial Intelligence in the reviewed literature was focused on activity recognition (34/64, 53%), followed by daily monitoring (10/64, 16%). Methodologically, tree-based and neural network-based approaches were the most prevalent Artificial Intelligence algorithms used in studies (32/64, 50% and 31/64, 48% respectively). A notable proportion of the studies (32/64, 50%) carried out their research using specially designed smart home testbeds that simulate the conditions in real-world.

A wide range of smart home indicators were leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, exploring and enhancing the potentials and effectiveness of solutions. However, our review has identified multiple research gaps that need further investigation. First, most research has been conducted in controlled testbed environments, leaving a lack of real-world applications that could validate the technologies' efficacy and scalability. Second, there is a noticeable absence of research leveraging cloud technology, an essential tool for large-scale deployment and standardized data collection and management. Future work should prioritize these areas to maximize the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Active Assisted Living settings."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0040"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0035", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0035", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "AI integration in Active Assisted Living devices aids healthy aging and independent living."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Majority of studies (61%) published post-2020, highlighting a growing research interest."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Tree-based and neural network algorithms most used in AI for aging-at-home technologies."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "50% of research utilized smart home testbeds, indicating a need for real-world application studies."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0030"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0030", "view": "all"}, "_": "Future research to focus on cloud technology for scalable Active Assisted Living solutions."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
