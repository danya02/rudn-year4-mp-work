With the aid of them, numerous data is generated from daily manufacturing operations. Big data analytics is used in locating deficiencies and thus improving the productivity of a manufacturing shopfloor. Many studies have also examined the effect of \u201cBlue Monday\u201d and \u201cpost-lunch slump\u201d on worker\u2019s performance. This paper provides a big data approach on analyzing worker\u2019s performance with the data collected from a manufacturing shopfloor. By evaluating the worker\u2019s performance at different time periods, a better decision can be arranged for improving overall productivity."}]}]}]}}
