Research shows that this choice-overload often leads to consumer dissatisfaction. As a consequence, assistive consumer technologies are needed to support decision making. Taking the fashion industry as an example, a common approach is to offer online services or self-service terminals that allow consumers to filter the product range according to their preferences. Nevertheless, this option is only applicable when the consumer is aware of his/ her actual preferences. The inspiration phase is a neglected area of research that offers huge potential for the development of new services to support the consumers in the buying process. This paper introduces the concept and prototype of a novel consumer interface for intuitively browsing a fashion product range based on visual preferences. In addition to an online version of the service a terminal for usage in retail stores is presented. The key idea of the visual interface is to position a selected fashion product in the middle of the screen and similar products in the surrounding environment comparable to terms in a tag cloud. The outer area of the virtual presentation shows products with a higher degree of dissimilarity. By selecting one of them the visualization rearranges. In the solution presented, product similarity is mainly based on visual features (e.g., brightness, color temperature, color values) which are extracted from product images. Finally, the functional as well as the hedonic value of the new approach are evaluated by a preliminary user study."}]}]}]}}
