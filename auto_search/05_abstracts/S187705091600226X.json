When a mesh client leaves the range of serving mesh router and searches for accessing a new router based on good SNR (Signal to Noise) ratio, a handoff procedure takes place. Whenever a mobile client leaves the range of its Home Mesh Router (HMR) and connects to a Foreign Mesh Router (FMR), mobile (roaming) client needs to authenticate itself as a legitimate node to its FMR in order to get the network services. Several handoff authentication techniques have been suggested by different researchers but leads to certain types of drawbacks i.e. handoff latency, computational overhead, security threats and storage overhead. In order to overwhelm over these hitches, this manuscript propose a technique Fast Handoff Technique (FHT). The suggested technique is compared and evaluated over the network metrics i.e. handoff latency and computational overhead. Further the approach is proved by describing a formal analysis over parameters."}]}]}]}}
