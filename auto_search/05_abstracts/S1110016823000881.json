The population's need for high-quality care is growing despite decreasing treatment costs. Because of technological improvements, a machine may remotely monitor health, which is more reliable than manual monitoring. The time required for individualized training may be shortened, and the dependability of complicated equipment may be increased. This study recommends a real-time remote patient monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to assure the accuracy of the vital real-time signal. The vital real-time signal is sent from the proposed method to the website using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This work aims to read and analyze patients\u2019 vital signs and reduce the latency while transmitting the signals."}]}]}]}}
