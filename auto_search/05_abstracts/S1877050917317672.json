Inspite of technology advances, proper medical facility and resources are still not available to a large percentage of population, especially those having low income and living in rural or remote areas. There is an urgent need for development of a low cost and highly reliable technology for monitoring healthcare for those living in such areas that provides rapid monitoring of basic vital health parameters for large numbers of people, and making this data readily available to doctor present anywhere in the world. A novel and an efficient biomedical device has been designed which can quickly monitor the vital signs of large number of people simultaneously and transmit that information wirelessly to the doctor or medical facility present anywhere in the world. The instrument is represented by a hub and spoke model with the spokes being the sensor nodes consisting of a microcontroller MSP430G2553 and a wireless transceiver nRF24L01 (IEEE 802.15.4). The hub consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 with the same transceiver. The data received at the hub can be transmitted to the doctor through the inbuilt IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi protocol) of Raspberry Pi 3. All that the instrument needs to work is a Wi-Fi or an Ethernet connection and all the sensor nodes can be powered from the coin cell batteries."}]}]}]}}
