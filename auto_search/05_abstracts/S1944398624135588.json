In addition, running and testing are conducted for the water quality monitoring system for a period of time. The results show that the designed system achieves effective water quality and real-time monitoring, wireless data transmission monitoring, storage and display of software platform for data, and remote control of monitoring equipment. What\u2019s more, on-site testing and inspection of related functions are carried out, which can work stably in the harsh environment. It is concluded that real-time collection of water quality monitoring data and transmission through the wireless network to the monitoring center achieve the goals of research."}]}]}]}}
