Such systems may be helpful especially for in-car audio, because driver\u2019s interaction with such infotainment systems could become a major subject of his/her distraction. There are two important tasks to be considered for better genre classification, which present classifier and audio features extraction. In the proposed system, timbral textural and pitch content features were used for genre classification. Timbral texture includes the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) along with other spectral characteristics. For the pitch content the features extracted from Chroma are selected. The aim of this work is to explore possibilities of music genres classification from audio signal and to create a system for automatic recognition of music genres in the MATLAB programming environment. A functional system for recognition of music genres was developed on the GTZAN data set with ten different musical genres such as rock, pop, classical etc. We examined several classification methods including GMM, SVM, and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "k"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-NN. The experimental results show that by using both types of features, the classification accuracy of 69.7% is achieved for the "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "k"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "-NN classifier."}]}]}]}]}}
