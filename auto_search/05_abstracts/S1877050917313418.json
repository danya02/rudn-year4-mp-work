Among these latter business processes are gaining more and more attention due to their crucial role in modern organizations and enterprises. Being able to identify and model processes inside organizations is for sure a key asset to discover their weak and strong points thus helping them in the improvement of their competitiveness. In this paper we describe a prototype system able to discover business processes from an event log and classify them with a suitable level of abstraction with reference to a related business ontology. The identified process, and its corresponding level of abstraction, depends on the knowledge encoded in the reference ontology which is dynamically exploited at runtime. The tool has been validated by considering examples and case studies from the literature on process mining."}]}]}]}}
