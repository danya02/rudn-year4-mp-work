To address the specificities of WSN, standards on networking protocols for low power sensors such as 6LoWPAN have been developed. While 6LoWPAN is well suited to fixed- sensor WSN, it must be extended to better address mobile sensors. However, so far little effort has been devoted to the handling of mobile sensor node peculiarities. In this article, generic mobility scenarios are highlighted, existing mobility solutions based in Mobile IPv6 are reviewed and remaining challenges to handle mobile sensors properly are identified."}]}]}]}}
