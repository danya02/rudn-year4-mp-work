Its purpose is to overcome security vulnerabilities that occur from using the same password for every transaction. When using a nonce as an encryption key for an encryption algorithm, for every data exchange a new random number is generated, thus creating an enhanced security process. Through utilizing this, authorization and data between Energy IoT(Internet of Things), Gateway, and User Device that exist in the same WPAN(Wireless Personal Area Network) can be protected."}]}]}]}}
