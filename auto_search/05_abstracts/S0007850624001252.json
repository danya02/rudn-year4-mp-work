Data science has potential to facilitate design decision-making through insight extraction, predictive analytics, and automatic decisions. A systematic scoping review is conduced to converge various D3 applications in four dimensions: the design dimension about design operations, the data dimension about popular data sources and common data-related challenges, the method dimension about the methodological foundations, and the social/ethical dimension about social/ethical considerations and implications. Based on the state-of-the-art, this paper also highlights potential future research avenues in this dynamic field."}]}]}]}}
