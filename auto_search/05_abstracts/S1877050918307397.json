TSCH aims at providing low power and high reliability to industrial networks. The communication in TSCH is handled by a schedule, that indicates when a node will transmit the data. Each cell in a schedule is identified with the tuple (time slot, channel offset). A group of time slots constitutes a slot-frame. The number of time-slots with in a slot-frame is termed as slot-frame length. This paper investigates the effect of slot-frame length on energy consumption using 6TiSCH simulator and ANOVA method. A cubic regression equation best fits the simulation results and the predicted values were in good agreement with the simulation results. The slot-frame length optimization is done using Hill Climbing. The energy consumption can be improved significantly through optimised slot-frame length."}]}]}]}}
