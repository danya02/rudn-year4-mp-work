The extracellular loop of h\u03b22 acting as the channel regulator influences the rectification and toxin sensitivity of BK channels, and the inactivation domain at its N terminus induces rapid inactivation. However, the regulatory mechanism, especially the trafficking mechanism of h\u03b22, is still unknown. With the help of immunofluorescence and patch clamp techniques, we determine that the h\u03b22 subunit alone resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that trafficking mechanism of h\u03b22 differs from that of h\u03b21 opposite to what we predicted previously. We further demonstrate that a four-turn \u03b1 helical segment at the N terminus of h\u03b22 prevents the surface expression of h\u03b22, that is, the helical segment itself is a retention signal. Using the c-Myc epitope-tagged extracellular loop of h\u03b22, we reveal that the most accessible site by antibody is located at the middle of the extracellular loop, which might provide clues to understand how the auxiliary \u03b2 subunits regulates the toxin sensitivity and the rectification of BK-type channels."}]}]}]}]}}
