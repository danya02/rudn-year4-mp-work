The dataset comprises a collection of 373 images depicting various mining operations and activities. Each image is georeferenced and offers a detailed view of mining activities, including the use of various equipment, infrastructure, and overall mining environment. This dataset has the potential to be a valuable resource for computer vision applications in the mining industry such as developing algorithms for identifying mining equipment, training deep learning models for safety analysis and optimization, and research on automation in mining operations. By making Mine4.0-MineCareerDB publicly available, we aim to stimulate further advancements in computer vision research and its applications in the mining sector.
