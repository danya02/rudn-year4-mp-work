The question arises whether current technologies allow cross-functional integration of data. This paper explores an IoT (Internet of Things) solution in controlling the HVAC system and monitoring of environmental, electric and comfort parameters in a real building. The implemented IoT solution proved to be flexible in terms of data exchange, deployment and debugging time in small and medium-size buildings and thus the IoT integration-based approach to be more efficient. This approach opens new possibilities for a wider set of beneficiaries. As future research, we are considering both extending our solution to other buildings within the university campus premises and on developing predictive analytics services."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "ab0010", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st1010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0135", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l4065"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li4145"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p4145", "view": "all"}, "_": "A new wired and wireless monitoring system based on IoT architecture.
