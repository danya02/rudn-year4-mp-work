However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e1851"}, "_": "Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations.
