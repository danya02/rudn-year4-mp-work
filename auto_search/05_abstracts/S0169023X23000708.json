They may support domain and language learning, model reuse, knowledge discovery for humans, and reliable automated processing and analysis if built following generally accepted quality requirements for scientific data management. More specifically, not unlike scientific (meta)data, models should be shared according to the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability). In this paper, we report on the construction of a FAIR model catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling research, a trending paradigm lying at the intersection of conceptual modeling and ontology engineering in which the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML emerged among the most adopted technologies.
