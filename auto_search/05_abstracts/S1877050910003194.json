Recently, they are also applied in e-learning tasks such as recommending resources (e.g. papers, books,..) to the learners (students). In this work, we propose a novel approach which uses recommender system techniques for educational data mining, especially for predicting student performance. To validate this approach, we compare recommender system techniques with traditional regression methods such as logistic/linear regression by using educational data for intelligent tutoring systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve prediction results."}]}]}]}}
