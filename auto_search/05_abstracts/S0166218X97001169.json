We also propose efficient routing algorithms to execute generic communication tasks, such as the total exchange and the multinode broadcast, in a Manhattan Street network of processors. The proposed algorithms execute these tasks in an optimal number of steps, while achieving full (equal to 100%) utilization of the network links. Finally, we construct edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles for the Manhattan Street network."}]}]}]}}
