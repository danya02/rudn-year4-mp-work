In compliance with the rapid growth of internet of things (IoT), Low power wide area Network (LPWA) technologies play a big role in connecting billions of devices. This paper aims to analyze the existing standard NB-IoT, LORA, Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) used as low power wide area Network (LPWA) in wireless network, in term of their power efficiency, QoS, cost and coverage distance. The outcome of the research shows that each technology presents its advantages and disadvantages based on the type of the application considered. It is shown that despite the improvement of researches on existing LPWA technologies, there are still issues that need to be addressed. Thus, this paper gives some open issues for future research."}]}]}]}}
