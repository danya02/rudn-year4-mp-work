The data were collected on 102 crossbred sows equipped with activity sensors, group-housed in video-recorded pens (16\u201318 sows per pen), with access to automatons. Feeding and drinking behaviours were extracted from the electronic feeders and drinkers\u2019 recordings. Social behaviours, physical activities and locations in the pen were recorded thanks to manual video analysis labelling at the individual scale. Accelerometer fixed on the sows\u2019 ears also recorded individual physical activities. The physical activity was also determined at a group scale by automatic video analysis using deep learning techniques. BWs, back fat thickness, and body condition (cleanliness, body damages) were recorded weekly during the whole gestation. Last gestation room data regarding environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, noise level) were recorded using automatic sensors. The database can fulfil different research purposes, namely sows\u2019 nutrition for example to better calculate the energy requirements regarding environmental factors, or also on welfare or health during gestation by providing indicators."}]}]}]}}
