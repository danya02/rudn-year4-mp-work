However, the route data contain noise due to the GPS pseudo-range errors. While there are some works on noise removal due to the errors, the previous works handle the errors in the data collection state rather than in the data pre-processing stage. In the field of business process, heuristic miner has been used to handle data noise in the event logs. This study aims to propose a method to build a transition matrix using the causal matrix based on the dependency measure in heuristic miner. The dependency measure resulted from heuristic miner is fed into a collaborative filtering approach, that is matrix factorization, to build a model. In the end, we compare the performance of the causal matrix with a traditional frequency-based approach to see the effect of the proposed method to remove the noise. The result showed that a transition matrix with a causal matrix from heuristic miner can produce a better performance than the transition matrix without the dependency measure with a causal matrix."}]}]}]}}
