Corporate management is executed based upon the decision made by the board meeting in general. However, the research which considered the contents of proceedings left behind the minutes of the company, and the relation of corporate profit with text mining is not enough so far. Therefore, we make an intensive research for the board meeting proceedings analysis with text mining to capture the change of the board meeting contents. As a result, the shift in the proceedings contents from short-term, store-based measures to long-term, corporate based planning coincides with the improvement of corporate performance."}]}]}]}}
