In such a case, network interference need to be controlled in a manner that users transmit at minimum power enough to sustain the transmission. This paper proposes a joint power and rate adaptation in ad hoc network based on coupled interference minimization (PRIM) where the formulated network utility maximization (NUM) is solved using reverse engineering based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In that way, users determine their transmit power and data rate based on their local observations (coupled interference). Pricing mechanism is employed in PRIM to restrict users from self-interest behaviours. It is demonstrated theoretically that PRIM satisfies the conditions of the super-modular games such that the local optimality is always the global optimality. Simulation results have shown that adapting transmits power and data rates based on the coupled interference (i.e. link dynamics) can improve the performance of ad hoc networks."}]}]}]}}
