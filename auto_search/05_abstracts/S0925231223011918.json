This increased attack surface has resulted in compromises of Cyber\u2013Physical Systems (CPS) with significant economic and life safety consequences. This paper proposes a hybrid model of anomaly detection of security threats to CPS by blending the signature-based and threshold-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) commonly used in IT networks, with a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to detect behaviour-based anomalies in OT networks. This hybrid model achieves more rapid detection of known threats through signature-based and threshold-based detection strategies, and more accurate detection of unknown threats via behaviour-based anomaly detection using ML algorithms."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e887", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e888"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e890", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e891", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e893"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e894"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e897", "view": "all"}, "_": "Anomaly detection in Cyber\u2013Physical Systems."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e899"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e902", "view": "all"}, "_": "Internet of Things (IoT) Security."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e904"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e907", "view": "all"}, "_": "One-class machine learning."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
