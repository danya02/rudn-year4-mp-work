The characteristics of tag search and the problems that arise when using it are given, which is followed by a description of the domain ontology and the semantic search algorithm. The main problems to be dealt with during the implementation of this approach are also indicated. After that, the results achieved with the use of semantic search are examined. In the conclusion, we discuss the direction of the further development of the algorithm within the framework of the information system and its expediency."}]}]}]}}
