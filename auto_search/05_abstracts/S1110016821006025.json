Moreover, this paper improves the estimation algorithm of students' specific location and direction on campus, and analyzes the network structure of the smart teaching system based on the actual needs of smart teaching, and builds a three-tier teaching structure system. In addition, on the basis of demand analysis, this paper sets the system function modules, analyzes the data processing effect of the network nodes of this smart campus through experimental research, and evaluates the system teaching effect. Finally, this paper uses simulation technology to analyze 100 sets of data to evaluate the data processing effect of ZigBee network. Through the experimental research results, we can see that the smart campus teaching system constructed in this paper has good results."}]}]}]}}
