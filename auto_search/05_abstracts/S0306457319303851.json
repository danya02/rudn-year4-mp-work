Works by prominent authors tend to receive disproportionately many citations, while publications by less well-known researchers covering the same topics may not attract as much attention. In this paper we address the shortcomings of traditional scientometric approaches by proposing a novel method that utilizes a classifier for predicting publication years based on latent topic distributions. We then calculate real-number innovation scores used to identify potential breakthrough papers and turnaround years. The proposed approach can complement existing citation-based measures of article importance and author contribution analysis; it opens as well novel research direction for time-based, innovation-centered research scientific output evaluation. In our experiments, we focus on two corpora of research papers published over several decades at two well-established conferences: The World Wide Web Conference (WWW) and the International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), containing around 3500 documents in total. We indicate significant years and demonstrate examples of highly-ranked papers, thus providing a novel insight on the evolution of the two conferences. Finally, we compare our results to citation analysis and discuss how our approach may complement traditional scientometrics."}]}]}]}}
