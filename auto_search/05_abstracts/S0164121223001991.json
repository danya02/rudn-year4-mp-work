Past research has not only underlined its significance, but also revealed its multi-faceted nature. The practice of software testing and its adoption is influenced by many factors that go beyond tools or technology. This paper sets out to investigate the context of software testing from the practitioners\u2019 point of view by mining and analyzing sentimental posts on the widely used question and answer website Stack Overflow. By qualitatively analyzing sentimental expressions of practitioners, which we extract from the Stack Overflow dataset using sentiment analysis tools, we discern factors that help us to better understand the lived experience of software engineers with regards to software testing. Grounded in the data that we have analyzed, we argue that sentiments like insecurity, despair and aspiration, have an impact on practitioners\u2019 attitude towards testing. We suggest that they are connected to concrete factors like the level of complexity of projects in which software testing is practiced."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e188"}, "$$": [{"#name": "italic", "_": "Editor\u2019s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e194"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e195"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e197"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e198"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e200"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e201"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e204"}, "_": "We combine NLP tools and STGT to investigate the sentiment in 200 testing posts."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e206"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e209"}, "_": "We evaluate whether sentiment analysis tools can be used in our specific context."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e211"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e214"}, "_": "We observe that the motivation to test is influenced by project complexity."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e216"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e219"}, "_": "We observe that sentiment towards testing is influenced by tacit knowledge."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e221"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e224"}, "_": "We find that practitioners are affected sentimentally by non-technical factors."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
