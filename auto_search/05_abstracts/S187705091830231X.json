Location privacy preserving involves not only a single location privacy but also the trajectory privacy where the mobile users in different locations publish the consecutive query requests. In this paper, we consider the problem of trajectory privacy preserving in MSN. Particularly, we propose privacy preserving algorithms based on R-constraint dummy trajectory (RcDT).
