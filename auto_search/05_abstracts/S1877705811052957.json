Hence, rescue efforts are hard to be carried out in case of coal mine accident. To deal with this problem, the paper at first introduces the characteristics, structure and network construction method of ZigBee protocol. Then, by using the ZigBee technology based on IEEE802.15.4 criteria, the wireless communication network and the structure of ZigBee communication module for coal mine are studied and designed. At last, multilateration positioning algorithm is employed to realize the positioning of coal miners. Coal miner positioning system enters into computer management system via network, laying important actual significance to the production safety and emergent resuce of coal mine."}]}]}]}}
