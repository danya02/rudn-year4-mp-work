Firstly, an entity template library is built to retrieve pharmacokinetics relevant articles. Then a set of tagging and extraction rules are applied to retrieve PK data from the article abstracts. To estimate the PK parameter population-average mean and between-study variance, a linear mixed meta-analysis model and an E\u2013M algorithm are developed to describe the probability distributions of PK parameters. Finally, a cross-validation procedure is developed to ascertain false-positive mining results. Using this approach to mine midazolam (MDZ) PK data, an 88% precision rate and 92% recall rate are achieved, with an "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "F-"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "score"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "="}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "90%.
