The primary aim is to assess the proposed method's ability to generate indicators that can serve as proxies for real environmental measures by leveraging the homepage content. We performed a Zero-Shot Text Classification (ZSTC) using a BERT-type Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, followed by a regression analysis to test the ability of these web-based indicators to replicate the B-Lab environmental index and comprehend the dynamics behind the results. This pilot study explains 57\u00a0% of the variance of the B-Lab environmental index using the results of the ZSTC score and companies' characteristics. This research makes two significant contributions. First, the text content of a company's homepage seems to provide insights into its environmental performance. Second, it introduces a generalizable methodology for studying the performance of companies through their websites without the need for heavy pre-processing, significantly reducing the time and cost of research. Furthermore, the method could provide policymakers with a real-time landscape to create and finetune policies about specific topics, partially addressing the problems associated with questionnaire-based surveys."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0010", "class": "author-highlights", "lang": "en", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0010", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0240", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "l0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0160"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0160", "view": "all"}, "_": "Web-based sustainable innovation indicators are promising proxies for environmental performance measures."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0165"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0165", "view": "all"}, "_": "The Zero-Shot Text Classification method for companies environemntal performance via websites is impactful."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0170"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0170", "view": "all"}, "_": "Company's homepage content provides insights into environmental performances, contributing to Signal Theory literature."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0175"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0175", "view": "all"}, "_": "Geographical location(Canada or the US), does not affect how companies address environmental issues."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "li0180"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0180", "view": "all"}, "_": "Industry category moderately affects the relationship between web-based environmental indicators and the B-Lab index."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
