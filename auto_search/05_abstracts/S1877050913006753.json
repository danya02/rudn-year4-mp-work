We present an extension of the Flocking algorithm for ADL clustering analysis. The Flocking based algorithm does not require an initial number of clusters, unlike other partition algorithms such as K-means. This approach allows us to learn ADL models automatically (without human supervision) to carry out activity recognition. By simulating a set of real case scenarios, an implementation of this model was tested in our smart home laboratory, the LIARA."}]}]}]}}
