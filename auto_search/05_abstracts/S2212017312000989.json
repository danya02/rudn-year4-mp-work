Multicast is a mechanism in the network that a node sends data to a set of nodes in the network. Finding a multicast tree which satisfies the problem constraints is a NP-Complete problem. This paper proposes a novel multicast routing in mobile Ad Hoc networks based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better speed, performance and efficiency than multicast routing based on genetic algorithm."}]}]}]}}
