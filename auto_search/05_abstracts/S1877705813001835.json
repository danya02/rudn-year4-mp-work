Sky's mesh network utilizing aerial altitude platform stations (AAPS) are driven via Wi-Fi and optical fiber to support and strengthen the capacity of network nodes by acquiring high quality coverage. The mechanism of AAPS Face a real challenge of precariousness due to winds; this challenge hinders network deployment due to loss of the line of sight (LoS). A smart communication platform system (SCPS) base station is proposed to overcome the limitations. Research aimed to evaluate the SCPS mechanism, to verify aptitude of system performance which is used to handling and supporting the communication networks in disaster areas."}]}]}]}}
