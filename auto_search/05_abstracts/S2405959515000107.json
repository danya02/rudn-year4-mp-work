A number of multi-path routing protocols have been proposed to address such issues. MMQR is a multi-path routing protocol for OFDM\u2013TDMA mesh networks which use multiple paths that can be replaced immediately by one another in case of link failures. In this paper we extend the MMQR such that the alternative paths are reordered adaptively as the communication environment changes based on the heuristic model of attractor selection mechanism by which biological entities are known to adapt to dynamically changing environment. Simulation results show that the multi-path routing protocol with attractor selection mechanism outperforms existing multi-path routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput and QoS."}]}]}]}}
