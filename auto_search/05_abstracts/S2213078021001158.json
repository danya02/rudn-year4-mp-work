Such so-called motifs were popularised by travel guides and art in the romantic era, and find their contemporary digital twins through images captured in social media. We developed and implemented a conceptual model of motifs, based around spatial clustering, image similarity and the appreciation of a motif by multiple individuals. We identified 119 motifs across Europe, using 2146176 georeferenced Creative Commons Flickr images found in Natura 2000 protected areas. About 65% of motifs contain cultural elements such as castles or bridges. The remaining 35% are natural features, and biased towards coastal elements such as cliffs. Characterisation and localisation of motifs could allow identification of locations subject to increased pressure, and thus disturbance, especially since the visual characteristics of motifs allow managers to explore why sites are being visited. Future work will include methods of calculating image similarity using tags, explore different algorithms for assessing content similarity and study the behaviour of motifs through time."}]}]}]}}
