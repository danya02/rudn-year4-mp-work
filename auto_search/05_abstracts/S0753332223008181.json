The dynamic course of the disease goes through steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinoma. Before progressing to carcinoma, timely and effective intervention will make the condition better, which highlights the importance of early diagnosis. With the further study of the biological mechanism in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD, some potential biomarkers have been discovered, and the possibility of their clinical application is gradually being discussed. At the same time, the progress of imaging technology and the emergence of new materials and methods also provide more possibilities for the diagnosis of NAFLD. This article reviews the diagnostic markers and advanced diagnostic methods of NAFLD in recent years."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"id": "ab0015", "class": "author-highlights", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sect0010"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0055", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "li0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0005"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0005", "view": "all"}, "_": "Further elucidating the mechanism of NAFLD progression to HCC will be of great help in exploring biomarkers."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "The combined application of multiple biomarkers, especially scoring systems, can improve the diagnostic capacity of NAFLD."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Full mining and analysis of imaging data is of great help to the early diagnosis of NAFLD."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "The application of multidisciplinary, artificial intelligence and new materials will shine in the field of NAFLD diagnosis."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
