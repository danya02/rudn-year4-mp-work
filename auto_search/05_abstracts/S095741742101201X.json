Thus, resources of formulaic expressions, such as a dictionary, that could be looked up easily would be useful. However, forms of formulaic expressions can often vary to a great extent.

Such a diversity of spans and forms causes problems in both extraction and evaluation of formulaic expressions. In this paper, we propose a new approach that is robust to variation of spans and forms of formulaic expressions. Our approach regards a sentence as consisting of a formulaic part and non-formulaic part. Then, instead of trying to extract formulaic expressions from a whole corpus, by extracting them from each sentence, different forms can be dealt with at once. Based on this formulation, to avoid the diversity problem, we propose evaluating extraction methods by how much they convey specific communicative functions rather than by comparing extracted expressions to an existing lexicon. We also propose a new extraction method that utilises named entities and dependency structures to remove the non-formulaic part from a sentence. Experimental results show that the proposed extraction method achieved the best performance compared to other existing methods."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e576"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e577"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e579"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e580"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e582"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e583"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e586"}, "_": "Formulaic expression extraction using named entities and dependency structure."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e588"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e591"}, "_": "Sentence retrieval task as an extrinsic evaluation for formulaic expressions."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e593"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e596"}, "_": "Changing weights on word embeddings captures characteristics of extraction methods."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
