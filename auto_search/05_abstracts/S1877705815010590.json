In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. As air pollution being a major environmental change that causes many hazardous effects on human beings that need to be controlled. Hence, we deployed WSN nodes for constant monitoring of the air pollution around the city and the moving public transport buses and cars. This methodology gave us the monitoring data from the stationary nodes deployed in the city to the mobile nodes on Public Transport buses and cars. The data of the air pollution particles such as gases, smoke and other pollutants is collected via sensors on the Public transport buses and the data is being analyzed when the buses and cars reach back to the source destination after passing through the stationary nodes around the city. Our proposed architecture having innovative mesh network will be more efficient way of gathering data from the nodes of WSN. It will have lots of benefits with respect to the future concept of Smart Cities that will have the new technologies related to Internet of Things."}]}]}]}}
