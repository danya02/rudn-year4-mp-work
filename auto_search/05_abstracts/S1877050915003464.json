An AW video surveillance system consists of WiMAX IP cameras connected directly to the Base stations while the HWW system consists of Wi-Fi IP cameras linked to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) which is equally linked to the base station. Local viewing PCs are connected at the CPE while remote viewing can be done via the internet. WiMAX and Wi-Fi IP cameras capture the video images; convert them to an appropriate digital signal and transmit them via Ethernet cables or wireless interface links. The investigation of the performance of the AW and HWW systems has been done by simulation of the systems using the OPNET modeler."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "spar0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Results show that, under similar conditions, the HWW video surveillance system outperforms the AW system in terms of throughput by a factor of 1.75. The results further show that throughput increases with increase in MSDU size and/or video resolutions, frame rate, number of nodes and decrease with increase in frame time, the reverse being true as well."}]}]}]}}
