It handles two-level pre-processing techniques to reduce the data size at the item level. Additional resources like items genre, tag, and time are added to learn and analyse the behaviour of the user preferences in-depth. The advantage of the proposed method is to recommend the item, based on user interest pattern and avoid recommending the outdated items. User information are grouped based on similar item genre and tag feature. This effectively handle overlapping conditions that exist on item\u2019s genre, as it has more than one genre at initial level. Further, based on time, it analyses the user non-static interest. Overall it reduces the dimensions which is an initial way to prepare data, to analyse hidden pattern. To enhance the performance, the proposed method utilized Apache\u2019s spark Mllib FP-Growth and association rule mining approach in a distributed environment. To reduce the computation cost of constructing tree in FP-Growth, the candidate data set is stored in matrix form. The experiments were conducted using MovieLens data set. The observed results shows that the proposed method achieves 4% increase in accuracy when compared to earlier methods."}]}]}]}}
