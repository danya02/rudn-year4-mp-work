Our objective is to try to assign wavelengths in an efficient manner with/without wavelength conversion to get a very low blocking probability and optimize the performance of the overall network. Thus, we implement and compare the performance of two proposed algorithms namely DWA \u201cDynamic Wavelength Assignment\u201d and SWA \u201cStatic Wavelength Assignment\u201d with well-known algorithms. We first present a literature review about previously proposed approaches, and then we introduce and evaluate our implemented approaches. We also discuss the wavelength converter placement problem in mesh networks. We finally corroborate our theoretical findings through extensive simulations."}]}]}]}}
