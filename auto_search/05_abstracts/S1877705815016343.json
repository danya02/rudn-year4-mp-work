In this paper, we introduce and study a deployment strategy for wireless on-street parking sensor networks. We define a multiple-objective problem in our analysis, and solve it with two real-world street parking maps. We present the results on the trade-off among minimum energy consumption, sensing information delay and the amount of deployed mesh routers and Internet gateways, i.e., the cost of city infrastructure. These results yield engineering insights for appraising and deploying city mesh infrastructure to provide smart parking services to urban users. We also analyze these trade-offs to see how different urban layouts affect the optimal solutions."}]}]}]}}
