Energy at the sensors must be preserved to increase the lifetime of the network. Clustering helps in reducing the number of transmissions between the Cluster Head (CH) and the Base Station (BS). In this paper, an Energy Conserved - Supervised Termite Colony based Role Assignment (EC-STCRA) scheme is proposed to conserve energy. The network is trained to provide better performance by incorporating efficient clustering, routing and security schemes. The CHs are randomly selected, and the soldier and the worker nodes are appointed based on their location and Residual Energy (RE). Efficient paths to the BS are found by selecting the worker nodes with high RE. The soldiers protect the network from attacks like Denial of Service (DoS), flooding and spoofing by maintaining an Active List (AL) of reliable nodes along with a Warning List (WL) and a Dead List (DL) of malicious nodes. EC-STCRA outperforms the existing Genetic algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based clustering and routing schemes in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), throughput, delay, Residual Energy (RE) and network lifetime."}]}]}]}}
