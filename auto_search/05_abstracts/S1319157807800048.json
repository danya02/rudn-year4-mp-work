Two levels of control have been considered: one at the triggering level for a wavelength request, and the other at the burst length level. It is believed that the proposed scheme improves both the provided QoS and the class separation in the wavelength-routed optical network. A comparative study with two other schemes will be undertaken, followed by a study of the effects of the triggering policy. Performance results under various network conditions and dynamic bursty traffic will be presented."}]}]}]}}
