The success of extracting collocations depends on the technique of preprocessing. A systematic pre-processing technique is described in this paper. Then the pre-processed data is used to extract collocation by using two methods: Point-wise Mutual Information and Fuzzy Bi-gram Index. The paper mainly focuses on bi-gram extraction from a Bengali news corpus. Collocations of higher length i.e., n-grams (n>2) are then obtained when the extracted collocations of lower lengths are treated as individual words."}]}]}]}}
