Recommending items and users to the users that are likely to buy or interact with them is a modern solution for AI-based applications. In this article, a novel architecture is used with the utilization of pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings of different approaches. The proposed architecture consists of several stages that have various advantages. In the first step of the proposed method, a knowledge graph from data is created, since multi-hop neighbors in this graph address the ambiguity and redundancy problems. Then knowledge graph representation learning techniques are used to learn low-dimensional vector representations for knowledge graph components. In the following a neural collaborative filtering framework is used which benefits from no extra weights on layers. It is only dependent on matrix operations. Learning over these operations uses the pre-trained embeddings, and fine-tune them. Evaluation metrics show that the proposed method is superior in over other state-of-the-art approaches. According to the experimental results, the criteria of recall, precision, and F1-score have been improved, on average by 3.87%, 2.42%, and 6.05%, respectively."}]}]}]}}
