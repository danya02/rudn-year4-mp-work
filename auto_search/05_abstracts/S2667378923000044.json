There are three methodologies available to identify green patents based on the code classification: ENV-TECH (developed by OECD), IPC Green Inventory (WIPO) and Y02/Y04S Tagging scheme (EPO). Our results are: the systematic organisation of green codes for each methodology and the development of algorithms for their periodic update; the application of these methodologies to two large datasets; the comparison of the three methodologies. The relevant findings are that ENV-TECH and IPC Green Inventory should be used in combination to identify more green patents, with the inclusion of the \"CPC\" ENV-TECH green codes when applicable. The Tagging scheme identifies fewer green patents than the combination of the other two methodologies. The three methodologies overlap only partially (in 22.47% of cases) and their mutual integration is recommended."}]}]}]}}
