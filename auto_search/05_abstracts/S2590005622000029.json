The ECA-MADOV protocol plays a predominant role in selecting an efficient route for the creation of an efficient multicast tree and selecting a unique group leader in the multicast group to share and exchange information among group members in an efficient way using a Computational Intelligence (CI) approach. The vague set is a CI that is an enhanced fragment of a fuzzy set. Each element in the Fuzzy set is mapped to [0,1], reflecting its membership grade. We estimated ECA-MAODV\u2019s time and spatial complexity. Besides, we assessed ECA-MAODV performance and compared it with conventional routing protocols such as MAODV and AODV. Finally, simulation results indicate that the ECA scheme proposed is both effective and powerful."}]}]}]}}
