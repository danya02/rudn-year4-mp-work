Different layers are involved in communication, but the behavior of these layers is isolated with each other and overall network performance may effect from their operations. A cross-layer approach can extract the critical information from multiple layers which can be further utilized to enhance the overall network performance and Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, Cross-layer Multicast Routing (CLMR) is introduced to enhance the QoS using a tree-based multicast routing protocol. In order to achieve QoS, optimization of the tree operations and tree management cost has been done. CLMR exploits the functionality of PHY layer, Application layer and Routing Layer for QoS oriented communication. Performance of CLMR is analyzed using Multicast Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (MAODV) routing protocol under various parameters, i.e. Throughput, Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio, Link Cost and Energy Consumption."}]}]}]}}
