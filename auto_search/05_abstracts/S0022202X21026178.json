Although they share a melanocytic origin with cutaneous melanoma (CM), patients with UM have few treatment options. BCL2 homologous 3 mimetics are small-molecule drugs that mimic proapoptotic BCL2 family members. We compared BCL2 family member expression between UM and CM using immunoblot and The Cancer Genome Atlas transcriptomic analysis. UM has a unique signature of low BFL1 and high PUMA proteins compared with CM and 30 other cancer types, making them an attractive candidate for BCL2 homologous 3 protein mimetics. We tested the efficacy of a BCL2 inhibitor and MCL1 inhibitor (MCL1i) in UM, with viability assays, live-cell imaging, sphere assays, and mouse xenograft models. UM had a higher sensitivity to MCL1i than CM. Overexpression of BFL1 or knockdown of "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "PUMA"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " made the UM more resistant to MCL1i. In contrast, MAPK/extracellular signal\u2012regulated kinase inhibitor treatment in CM made them more sensitive to MCL1i. However, MCL1i-alone treatment was not very effective to reduce the UM initiating cells; to overcome this, we employed a combination of MCL1i with BCL2 inhibitor that synergistically inhibited UM initiating cell\u2019s capacity to expand. Overall, we identify a distinct expression profile of BCL2 family members for UM that makes them susceptible to BCL2 homologous 3 mimetics."}]}]}]}]}}
