In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link \u201cdigital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs\u201d in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs."}]}]}]}}
