As the device resolution varies, the codec designed for Scalable video (H.264/AVC) is the only solution for its support. But the challenge is in its transmission due to the limited network resources in wireless networks viz; bandwidth. This introduces jitter during video playback. This needs an effective Compression technique to reduce the possible transmission time. The paper presents a novel Adaptive Dual Tree Complex wavelet Transoform (ADT-CWT) using the efficient Motion Block Estimation (MBE), Diamond search with Large Diamond Search Path (LDSP) and a Small Diamond Search Path (SDSP). This technique effectively improves the performance of Scalable Video in wireless transmission. The PSNR and the Compression Ratio (CR) are considered for the comparison."}]}]}]}}
