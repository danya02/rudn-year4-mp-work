Providing a green and virtually infinite alternative power source to traditional energy sources, this harvester will significantly expand the applications of wireless sensor networks and other technologies. Using piezoelectric materials to harvest the ambient vibrations that surround a system is one method that has seen a dramatic rise in the power-harvesting applications. The simplicity associated with piezoelectric micro-generators makes them very attractive for MEMS applications in which ambient vibrations are harvested and converted into electric energy. These micro generators can become an alternative to the battery-based solutions in the future, especially for remote systems. In this paper, we proposed a model and presented the simulation of a MEMS-based arrayed energy harvester under ambient vibration excitation using the Coventorware approach. This arrayed cantilever-based MEMS energy harvester that operates under ambient excitation of frequency band of 67 to 70"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "Hz, within a base acceleration of 0.2 to 1.3"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "g produces an output power of 6.8"}, {"#name": "hsp", "$": {"sp": "0.25"}}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "\u03bcw and 0.4 volts at 20.1 k-ohms load."}]}]}]}]}}
