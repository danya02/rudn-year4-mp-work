With computerised methods, such as web crawling, text mining, and keyword classification, it is possible to identify expertise networks from the raw unstructured data. The paper presents and analyses the extended expertise network of the CIRP scientific community and proposes a web-based tool for the structuring and management of the community\u2019s expertise."}]}]}]}}
