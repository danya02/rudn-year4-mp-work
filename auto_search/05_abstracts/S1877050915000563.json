One of the key issues in FiWi network is ONU placement since it is related to network deployment cost. The present work proposes a cost efficient algorithm for ONU placement. Initially we place ONUs in center region of each grid. Then we minimize the number of ONUs by ensuring that all the wireless routers are connected to at least one ONU. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm offers better solution for optimal placement of ONUs. Hence, by using proposed algorithm we can make cost-efficient FiWi network."}]}]}]}}
