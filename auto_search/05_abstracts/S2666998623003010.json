However, their utilization is hampered by the complexity of existing readout techniques and the absence of memory functionality within the sensor. Here, we present a reader technique that can automatically lock to the sensor value wirelessly through inductive coupling, significantly reducing the reader complexity. By integrating a high-frequency audio link and wireless powering, we demonstrate a battery-free and flexible reader. We integrated this reader for wireless temperature logging, which logs temperature data based on the irreversible geometric change of low-melting-point metal during phase transitions, resulting in non-volatile resistance change. As a whole, these results establish the feasibility of a simplistic reader and a passive non-volatile thermistor sensor, opening up new possibilities for disposable and ubiquitous temperature monitoring as well as a range of other applications."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "undfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "locator": "fx1", "type": "simple", "href": "pii:S2666998623003010/fx1", "id": "aep-link-id7"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0020"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "A battery-free, sticker-like reader for wireless passive sensors"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "A passive wireless sensor capable of recording temperature abuse history"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Utilizing self-oscillation for reader simplicity rather than forced excitation"}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "editor-highlights", "id": "abs0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0025"}, "_": "The bigger picture"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "The applications of passive wireless sensors are expected to continue growing due to their simplicity, which facilitates daily usage. Ideally, a sensor should be capable of measuring non-transient data, a challenge given their minimalistic design. Additionally, an equally minimalistic reader is needed to facilitate everyday applications. In this context, we introduce a reader that operates through self-oscillation, enabling a flexible, sticker-like reader that is compatible with smartphone NFC technology. The potential for this reader to function with any passive sensor would be of interest to the broader device community. The sensor employs an irreversible phase transition to record non-transient data, demonstrated here through the measurement of the temperature abuse history of food.
