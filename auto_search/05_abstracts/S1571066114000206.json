CC can be combined with topology control to increase connectivity at the cost of a small increase in energy consumption. This work focuses on exploring CC to improve the connectivity with a sink node in ad hoc wireless networks. More precisely, this work proposes a new technique, named CoopSink, that combines CC and topology control techniques to increase connectivity to a sink node while ensuring energy-efficient routes. Simulation results show that connectivity and routing to the sink cost can be improved up to 6.8 and 2.3 times, respectively, when compared with other similar strategies."}]}]}]}}
