All of them require inspection, which is infeasible to perform using monitoring sensors, such as accelerometers. The authors proposed a novel method for the rotational speed measurement of idlers based on image data analysis. The relation is assumed of the rotation speed decrease due to internal defects. The procedure of visual data processing is verified on the real conveyor idlers. The remote sensing method can be applied in mobile inspection robots such as UAVs or UGVs as well as for manual camera recordings. The accuracy of the proposed method is 0.13-0.67% error depending on the speed range, which is provided by the standard sampling rates (30-60 FPS) and video resolution (1280 x 720 px). Recommendations are formulated for method implementation in practice."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e534", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e535"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e537", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e538", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e540"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e541"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e544", "view": "all"}, "_": "The original image-based method for contact-less rotation speed measurement is developed."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e546"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e549", "view": "all"}, "_": "The new method is based on video recording and does not require any markers."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e551"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e554", "view": "all"}, "_": "The error of measurement is less than 1% depending on the speed level."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e556"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e559", "view": "all"}, "_": "The standard resolution (1280 x 720 px) and sampling rates (30-60 FPS) are only required."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e561"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e564", "view": "all"}, "_": "The remote sensing method is applicable in inspection robots for conveyor idlers\u2019 diagnostics."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
