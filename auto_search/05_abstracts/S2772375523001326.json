Irrigation has a huge impact on crop productivity, but traditional irrigation systems can be replaced with Advanced and Smart irrigation techniques, which can enhance production yield even more. In arid regions where water is scarce, drip irrigation is a good option because water is supplied at a low rate and it also saves a lot of water, whereas, in horticulture, sprinkler systems are widely used because they do not require large pipelines all over large lands and instead spray water droplets all over the area like rain. The purpose of this article is to analyze the various types of smart drip and sprinkler irrigation systems with the help of IoT and also find solution for the various challenges found in the various methods. Various irrigation technologies which include IoT are reviewed, with a focus on smart drip and sprinkler systems. Various comparisons have been conducted between various methods to find the most efficient one in both irrigation techniques. A table summarizing the similarities between the various methods is also presented. Finally, all of this leads to saving water and making farmers' work easier."}]}]}]}}
