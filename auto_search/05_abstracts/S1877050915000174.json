To prevent this, there is a requirement to design more survivable and reliable network. In FiWi networks there are two types of failures viz. ONU level failure and segment /OLT level failure. In the present work, to handle segment level failure, we propose an efficient algorithm viz. \u201cFully Mesh based protection scheme\u201d. In the proposed algorithm we connect backup ONUs from each segment in a fully mesh fashion. Simulation result shows that proposed algorithm improves network survivability in terms of reduced blocking probability."}]}]}]}}
