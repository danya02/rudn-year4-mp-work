Green routing mechanisms may use more resources in serving equal number of connection requests in optical networks, which makes them less favorable for Internet and infrastructure providers. This work shows that the usage of green and hybrid routing mechanism is in fact more resource efficient than using traditional non-green routing methods by simply choosing the greenest route. The amount of greenness of routes in optical networks is requested through GSLA mandating service providers to provide routes for connection requests that are being powered ON by at least certain amount of green energy such as solar energy."}]}]}]}}
