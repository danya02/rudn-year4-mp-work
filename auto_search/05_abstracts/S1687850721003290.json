The paper examines the performance of IEEE802.15.4/Zigbee based WSN for nuclear medicine practice using OPNET Modeler simulation tool. We introduce a reliable integrated remote sensing solution based on Zigbee technology for nuclear medicine practices, to detect radiation exposure, and contamination in the production, diagnostic, and therapeutic area. Different scenarios are analyzed to check the network coverage using star, tree, and mesh network routing configurations. The simulation results focus on the Quality of Service (QOS) related metrics; throughput, load, and an end to end delay as an indicator on the network optimal performance and to select the best suitable combination out of the proposed network architectures."}]}]}]}}
