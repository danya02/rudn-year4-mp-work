Recent data suggest that at physiological temperature SVs are internalized via clathrin-independent ultrafast endocytosis (UFE) within hundreds of milliseconds, while other studies have postulated a key role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of SV proteins on a timescale of seconds to tens of seconds. Here we demonstrate using cultured hippocampal neurons as a model that at physiological temperature SV endocytosis occurs on several timescales from less than a second to several seconds, yet, is largely independent of clathrin. Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) of SV membranes is mediated by actin-nucleating formins such as mDia1, which are required for the formation of presynaptic endosome-like vacuoles from which SVs reform. Our results resolve previous discrepancies in the field and suggest that SV\u00a0membranes are predominantly retrieved via CIE mediated by formin-dependent actin assembly."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "SV proteins are retrieved on multiple timescales at physiological temperature"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Clathrin/AP-2 are largely dispensable for SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "SV endocytosis is mediated by formin-dependent actin assembly"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0025"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Formin activity is required for formation of synaptic endosome-like vacuoles"}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Neurotransmission requires exo-/endocytic cycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs).
