In this work, an intermediary region (IR) at the border of the center region (CR) and edge region (ER) is defined, which prevents severe cross-tier interference and is usually ignored by other schemes. Furthermore, a strategic resource allocation scheme is proposed, which allows macro users in this new region to be served more resources due to their good channel conditions close to the serving base station (BS), while femto users are assigned resource blocks from sub-bands that receive the least net interference from a set of usable sub-bands in any region. We find by analysis and simulation the optimal threshold for IR, which minimizes the cross-tier interference, and show that the femto throughput is also maximized for this threshold. Numerical results show the proposed scheme outperforms other notable schemes in terms of throughput and outage performances."}]}]}]}}
