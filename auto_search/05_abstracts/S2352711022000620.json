It focuses on dependable (reliable and secure) low-power communications and standardised protocols, such as 6LoWPAN, IPv6, 6TiSCH, RPL, and CoAP. Its primary aims are to (i)\u00a0facilitate rapid prototyping and evaluation of Internet of Things research ideas, (ii)\u00a0reduce time-to-market for Internet of Things applications, and (iii)\u00a0provide an easy-to-use platform for teaching embedded systems-related courses in higher education. Contiki-NG started as a fork of the Contiki OS and retains many of its original features. In this paper, we discuss the motivation behind the creation of Contiki-NG, present the most recent version\u00a0(v4.7), and highlight the impact of Contiki-NG through specific examples."}]}]}]}}
