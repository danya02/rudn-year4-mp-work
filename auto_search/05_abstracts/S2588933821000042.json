However, the current LIMSs do not contain functions to improve the safety of laboratory work, which is the major concern of biosafety laboratories (BSLs). With tons of biosafety information that need to be managed and an increasing number of biosafety-related research projects under way, it is worthy of expanding the current framework of LIMS and building a system that is more suitable for BSL usage. Such a system should carefully trade off between the safety and efficiency of regular lab activities, allowing the laboratory staff to conduct their research as free as possible while ensuring their and the environment\u2019s safety. In order to achieve this goal, the information on the research contents, laboratory personnel, experimental materials and experimental equipment need to be well collected and fully utilized by a centralized system and its databases."}]}]}]}}
