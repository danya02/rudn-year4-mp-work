The baseline examination involved anthropometrics, body fat percentage, a food frequency questionnaire and information on lifestyle. From the questionnaire data we computed association rules between the intake of food groups and changes in waist circumference and body weight. Using association rule mining on subgroups and gender-specific cohorts, we identified non-uniform associations.
