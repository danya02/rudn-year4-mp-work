Therefore, there is a need to build novel methods for detecting the very presence of Bluetooth mesh networks to aid the law enforcement agencies. This paper contributes to building a new dataset for the aid of machine learning tools to detect the presence of Bluetooth mesh networks. The dataset is extracted from a simulated Bluetooth mesh network with 52 BT network traffic attributes, using the Bridgefy application. Further, the dataset is optimized by identifying prime features, using label encoding, one-hot encoding, correlation analysis and evaluated by various Machine Learning (ML) tools. An accuracy of 99.6% is achieved after optimizing the feature set."}]}]}]}}
