This work provides a simple and controllable preparation route, in which covalent modified reduced graphene oxide (E-RGO) is successfully prepared by ethylenediamine (EDA) and graphene oxide (GO), and E-RGO with different degrees of modification is obtained by adjusting the amount of EDA during the preparation process, and then in situ polymerization of aniline monomer is used to produce E-RGO/PANI in E-RGO suspension. Among them, E-RGO-12 has a relatively stretched sheet, which provides a large support surface for the subsequent in-situ polymerization of aniline and increases the utilization rate of graphene. The PANI network is tightly wrapped on the surface of E-RGO, forming a \u201cPANI-(E-RGO)-PANI\u201d lamellar structure and the single components are connected by covalent bonds and have a strong conjugation effect. The rough surface of the E-RGO/PANI composite and the pores in the PANI network are conducive for the electrochemical process, which increases the active site of electrode reaction, and thus improve the electron transfer rate. E-RGO-12/PANI exhibits superior property with the specific capacitance of 398\u00a0F/g at 0.6 A/g, and after the current density changes to 6 A/g, the specific capacitance retention rate is 64.8%. After 2000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is 76.4%. The current work provides a green and efficient new idea for reducing graphene oxide and preparing E-RGO/PANI composite materials for the energy storage device."}]}]}]}}
