While achieving excellent results, the rising number of crime cases has also brought great challenges to the work of the prosecution organs. At the same time, the traditional relational database has become more and more disadvantageous in dealing with large-scale, unstructured and complex dynamic data, and can no longer meet the actual needs. In order to further improve the efficiency and quality of prosecutors\u2019 work, alleviate the problem of \"too many cases and too few people\", and promote the construction of \"smart prosecution\", this paper uses knowledge extraction and other methods to identify the key entities and relationships in the job-related crimes indictments of the Shanghai Pudong New District Procuratorate. Then using Neo4j graph database to store the extracted information and build a knowledge graph for job-related crime cases, which realizes the visualization and deep mining of job-related crime, providing a new way and tool for prosecution work as well as prosecution personnel to analyze and handle job-related crime cases."}]}]}]}}
