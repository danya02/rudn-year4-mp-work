Although most work focuses on learning low-dimensional node representation in static graphs, the dynamic nature of real-world networks makes temporal graphs more practical and significant. In this paper, we propose a dynamic graph representation learning method based on a temporal graph transformer (TGT), which can efficiently preserve high-order information and temporally evolve structural properties by incorporating an update module, an aggregation module, and a propagation module in a single model. The experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that the TGT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for dynamic link prediction and edge classification tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."}]}]}]}}
