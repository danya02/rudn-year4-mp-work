The Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops a series of specifications, called the Web of Things (WoT), to address this challenge. WoT is focused on integrating smart things into the application layer of a system using on Web technologies. Thus, WoT is expected to have a great impact on the smart retrofit of buildings once data from existing and future planned systems are able to be gathered and analysed seamlessly. In this paper, we ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "i"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") analyse the application of the W3C WoT on the core of the Building Energy Management System (BEMS) to enable the universal integration of both private and public systems; ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "ii"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") propose a novel architecture for the BEMS based on the W3C specifications; and ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "iii"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") present a real-world application based on this architecture. The application covered in this paper allows data gathering from sensors with standard commands, enabling data analysis with a simple collecting process. By applying these specifications, smart building retrofit can be benefited from: ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "i"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") the ability to merge and scale different systems and devices; ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "ii"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") the easiness to access data; ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "iii"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") the reduction of development and maintenance costs; and ("}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "iv"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") offering standard interfaces to the BEMS."}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "view": "all", "id": "d1e275"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e276"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e278"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e279"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e281"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e282"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e285"}, "_": "Interoperability issues on networks of heterogeneous devices create a complex challenge."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e287"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e290"}, "_": "Web of Things increases interoperability among Internet of Things platforms."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e292"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e295"}, "_": "Smart retrofit of buildings can be foster with the adoption of Web of Things approaches."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e297"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e300"}, "_": "Time and cost are saved when the smart retrofit of buildings adopts Web of Things."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e302"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e305"}, "_": "The ability to scale building energy management systems is improved using Web of Things."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
