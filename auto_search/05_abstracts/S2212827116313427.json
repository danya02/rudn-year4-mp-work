As one example, a real-time application for environment monitoring in manufacturing will offer the opportunity to improve its resource and energy efficiency. This requires a structured approach to integrating both WSN and IoT. Although established technology exists, there is a lack of methodology to construct multiple hardware and software platforms and interoperate them effectively. Thus, this paper presents a two-step framework in order to first design a system architecture and then to determine selection criteria for each component. A case study for temperature monitoring is presented for a proof-of-concept."}]}]}]}}
