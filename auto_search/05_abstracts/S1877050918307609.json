The motive is to use a distributed system, instead of a standalone/monolithic system, to present a new and unique way to visualise the data available through twitter, and analyze it to extract useful information. The prototype processes real-time data in the data stream with corresponding high processing speed and suitable communication patterns, with the use of hashtags to define the type of information to be analysed."}]}]}]}}
