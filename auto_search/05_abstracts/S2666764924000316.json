Data labeling difficulties, incorrect conclusions, and vulnerability to malicious data injections are only a few drawbacks of using machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity. To overcome these obstacles, researchers have created several network IDS models, such as the Hidden Naive Bayes Multiclass Classifier and supervised/unsupervised machine learning techniques. This study provides an updated learning strategy for artificial neural network (ANN) to address data categorization problems caused by unbalanced data. Compared to traditional approaches, the augmented ANN\u2019s 92% accuracy is a significant improvement owing to the network\u2019s increased resilience to disturbances and computational complexity, brought about by the addition of a random weight and standard scaler. Considering the ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, this study introduces a revolutionary intrusion detection method."}]}]}]}}
