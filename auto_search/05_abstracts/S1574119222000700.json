In the coming years, we expect sensors in buildings to become part of the Internet of Things ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "IoT"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") and grow in numbers to form a Dense Indoor Sensor Network ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "DISN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") that allows for unprecedented analysis of the performance, use, and interaction with buildings. Multiple technologies vie for leading this transformation. We explore Long Range Wide Area Network ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "LoRaWAN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") as an alternative for creating indoor sensor networks that extends beyond its original long-distance communication purpose. For the present paper, we developed a "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "DISN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " with 390 sensor nodes and four gateways and empirically evaluated its performance for two years. Our analysis of more than 86 million transmissions revealed that "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "DISN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "s achieve a much lower distance coverage compared to estimations from previous research indicating that more gateways are required. In addition, the deployment of multiple gateways decreased the loss of transmissions due to environmental and network factors. Given the complexity of our system, we received few colliding concurrent messages, which demonstrates a gap between the projected requirements of "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "LoRaWAN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " systems and the actual requirements of real-world applications given sufficient gateways. We also contribute to the modelling of transmissions with our comparison of attenuation models derived from multiple methodologies. Across all models, we find that robust coverage in an indoor environment can be maintained by placing a gateway every 30\u00a0m and every 5 floors. Finally, we also investigate the application of "}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "DISN"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "s for the passive sensing and visualisation of human presence using a Digital Twin ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "DT"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") and a Fused Twins ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "FT"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ") representation in Augmented Reality ("}, {"#name": "small-caps", "_": "AR"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ").
