This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of data-driven technologies in digital supply chains. Additionally, some bibliometric methods, such as co-word analysis, are utilized to study the intellectual structure of the field and present a big picture. The co-word analysis maps data-driven technologies\u2019 intellectual structure in digital supply chains and logistics. 3887 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus between 2010 and 2021 were collected and analyzed. Then, a strategic diagram is employed on the co-occurrence network, indicating each theme\u2019s current situation from two aspects of applicability and theory development. The study reveals that IoT and CPS technologies are in their infancy in digital supply chains and logistics, and additional studies are needed to fill the research gaps in this field."}]}]}]}}
