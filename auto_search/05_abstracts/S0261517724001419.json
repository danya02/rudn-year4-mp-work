However, current research often adopts a static approach, failing to capture the dynamic nature of tourist needs and the evolving competitiveness of a destination. To address this, we introduce a novel approach using user-generated content from various social media platforms over a six-year period to assess key attributes that influence destination competitiveness. The results indicate that attributes in deciding destination competitiveness are not fixed, with some remaining stable factors in competitiveness, while others fluctuate over time. Attributes that even alter their competitive standing could significantly impact overall destination competitiveness. This research contributes a dynamic model that allows destination managers to adapt strategies in real time, aligning with current market conditions and enhancing competitiveness in the tourism industry."}]}]}]}}
