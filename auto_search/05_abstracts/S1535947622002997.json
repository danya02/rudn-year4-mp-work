Herein, we described a spatially resolved top-down proteomics (TDP) platform for proteoform identification and quantitation directly from tissue sections. The spatial TDP platform consisted of a nanodroplet processing in one pot for trace samples\u2013based sample preparation system and an laser capture microdissection\u2013based cell isolation system. We improved the nanodroplet processing in one pot for trace samples sample preparation by adding benzonase in the extraction buffer to enhance the coverage of nucleus proteins. Using \u223c200 cultured cells as test samples, this approach increased total proteoform identifications from 493 to 700; with newly identified proteoforms primarily corresponding to nuclear proteins. To demonstrate the spatial TDP platform in tissue samples, we analyzed laser capture microdissection\u2013isolated tissue voxels from rat brain cortex and hypothalamus regions. We quantified 509 proteoforms within the union of top-down mass spectrometry\u2013based proteoform identification and characterization and TDPortal identifications to match with features from protein mass extractor. Several proteoforms corresponding to the same gene exhibited mixed abundance profiles between two tissue regions, suggesting potential posttranslational modification\u2013specific spatial distributions.
