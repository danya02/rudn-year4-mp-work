However, this poses challenges for organizations aiming to engage with genuine users. This paper introduces a novel approach combining natural language processing (NLP) and domain validation to identify disposable email addresses. The technique employs various machine learning methods, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, K Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Linear, and Discriminant Analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on blacklists, this technique achieves a 97% accuracy rate by effectively detecting and classifying new disposable emails."}]}]}]}}
