This necessitates an initial overview of how digital tools are currently applied in daylighting studies, which helps to understand the goals of these models and ensure they are aligned with their intended applications. To address this, a systematic search conducted on the Web of Science (WoS) database yielded 1,441 studies, of which 1,102 were found relevant and employed digital tools for daylight analysis up to March 2023. This thorough analysis identified five primary thematic areas in the use of digital tools for daylighting research: Optimisation (49%), Calculation methods (17%), Assessment (13%), Accuracy (10%), and Decision-making (8%), collectively compromising 97% of the analysed articles."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "We subsequently concentrated on two pivotal areas, \u2019Calculation Methods\u2019 and \u2019Accuracy\u2019, to undertake a qualitative analysis of the discussed challenges related to accuracy linked to three main aspects: Input data, Computational process, and Output.
