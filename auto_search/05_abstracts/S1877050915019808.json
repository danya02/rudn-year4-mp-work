This has as result the emergence of a new computing paradigm which is the Mobile Grid. This paper presents the simulation results in order to choose the best routing protocol to give the highest performance when implement the routing protocols in the target mobile grid application. This simulation gives the results for three ad hoc routing protocols named DSDV, DSR and AODV. In this paper these results are shown or simulated by Network Simulator (NS 2.34).The simulations have shown that the conventional routing protocols like DSR have a dramatic decrease in performance when mobility is high. However the AODV and DSDV are perform very well when mobility is high."}]}]}]}}
