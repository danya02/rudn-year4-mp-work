Openflow is a well-known architecture that facilitates SDN. The core idea of Openflow is to control the switch or router through programming from the centralized controller. The connection reliability is a major concern for the network service providers. The analysis of network resiliency is required for this new paradigm. The resiliency is the network's ability to survive against attacks and other component failures. This paper focuses on a comparison of different data forwarding algorithms currently supported by the POX standards for protection and restoration. Understanding existing approaches or standards in SDN plays a crucial role in network resiliency or protection and restoration. We also provide the extension of one of the components in POX for improvement. The restoration scheme in the current POX components as well as in the modified component is evaluated and compared."}]}]}]}}
