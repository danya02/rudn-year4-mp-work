There are four types of PADs, I, II, III, and V, in humans. We studied the subcellular distribution of PAD V in HL-60 granulocytes and peripheral blood granulocytes. Expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged PADs in HeLa cells revealed that PAD V is localized in the nucleus, whereas PAD I, II, and III are localized in the cytoplasm. PAD V deletion mutants indicated that the sequence residues 45\u201374 have a nuclear localization signal (NLS). A sequence feature of this NLS is a three-lysine residue cluster preceded by a proline residue and is not found in the three other PADs. Substitution of the lysine cluster by an alanine cluster abrogated the nuclear import activity. These results suggested that the NLS is a classical monopartite NLS. HL-60 granulocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils stained with antibody specific for PAD V exhibited distinct positive signals in the nucleus. Subcellular fractionation of HL-60 granulocytes also showed the nuclear localization of the enzyme.
