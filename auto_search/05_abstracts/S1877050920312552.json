Caching in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) has become one of the most critical research areas in today\u2019s world, especially for the leading in content delivery over Internet companies like Netflix, Facebook, Google, etc. This paper is intended to propose a novel Caching strategy called Weighted Greedy Dual Size Frequency for caching in Information-Centric networks. In this paper, the WGDSF considers multiple critical factors for maintaining the Web Content efficiently in ICN Caching Router. Simulation is done for the various performance metrics like Cache Hit ratio, Link load, Path Stretch, and Latency for WGDSF cache replacement algorithm, and results shown that WGDSF outperforms well compared with LRU, LFU, and RAND Caching Strategies."}]}]}]}}
