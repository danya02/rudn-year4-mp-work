The tool proposes a generic methodology for performance analysis and then shows its application on an industrial multi-grade paper making process. The tool framework facilitates data preprocessing and data mining, configuration and calculation of key performance indices (KPIs), benchmarking and gap analysis for benefit estimation. It also helps in better performance visualization and identification of the root cause of variations in performance in paper mills. To illustrate the concept, key results from performance analysis study done on a paper machine are presented and suggested measures to improve performance are discussed."}]}]}]}}
