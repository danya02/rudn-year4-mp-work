The second step entails graph mining and clustering to present an enriched recommendation via ATC code, which itself comprises several steps. First, the initial graph is constructed from historical prescription data. Then, data pruning is performed in the second step, after which the medicines with a high repetition rate are removed at the discretion of a general medical practitioner. Next, the medicines are matched to a well-known medicine classification system called the ATC code to provide an enriched recommendation. And finally, the DBSCAN and Louvain algorithms cluster medicines in the final step."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"role": "results", "id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0025"}, "_": "Results"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "A list of recommended medicines is provided as the system's output, and physicians can choose one or more of the medicines based on the patient's clinical symptoms.
