Our research is based on Twitter conversations about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This paper intends to monitor and analyze the Twitter conversation on the continuing war in Ukraine using natural language processing techniques such as word cloud analysis, sentiment analysis, and visualization. The major goal is to acquire insight into Twitter users\u2019 shifting thoughts and opinions on various parts of the conflict over time. The study\u2019s findings have important implications for politicians, journalists, and social media users who want to follow and understand how online communities\u2019 attitudes on global issues change. We hope that this study will help to gain a deeper knowledge of how social media works in affecting public debate and how it might be used to gain insights into public opinion on crucial global issues. In this work logistic regression, K-nearest neighbours and decision tree algorithm are used to analyse the sentiments and got classification accuracy of 94.58%, 88.89% and 90.45% respectively."}]}]}]}}
