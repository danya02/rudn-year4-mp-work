In this paper, we present ARGAEL, an open-source desktop tool designed to provide flexibility, effectiveness and efficiency on the manual annotation of related arguments in text documents. ARGAEL supports the use of rich, configurable argument models, the labeling of argument components and relations, and the assessment of argument annotations from multiple people, being suitable for large-scale, collaborative argument annotation processes."}]}]}]}}
