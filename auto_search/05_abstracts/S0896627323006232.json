Physical exercise has been shown to reduce A\u03b2 burden in various AD mouse models, but the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Irisin, an exercise-induced hormone, is the secreted form of fibronectin type-III-domain-containing 5 (FNDC5). Here, using a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model of AD, we show that irisin significantly reduces A\u03b2 pathology by increasing astrocytic release of the A\u03b2-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP). This is mediated by downregulation of ERK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, we show that integrin \u03b1V/\u03b25 acts as the irisin receptor on astrocytes required for irisin-induced release of astrocytic NEP, leading to clearance of A\u03b2. Our findings reveal for the first time a cellular and molecular mechanism by which exercise-induced irisin attenuates A\u03b2 pathology, suggesting a new target pathway for therapies aimed at the prevention and treatment of AD."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "abs0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "sectitle0015"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0015", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "ulist0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0010"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0010", "view": "all"}, "_": "Irisin promotes NEP secretion, leading to A\u03b2 decrease in 3D-AD culture"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0015"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0015", "view": "all"}, "_": "Integrin \u03b1V/\u03b25 serves as the irisin receptor on astrocytes to induce NEP secretion"}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "u0020"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "p0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Irisin-induced NEP secretion is mediated by downregulating ERK-STAT3 signaling"}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "teaser", "id": "abs0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "abssec0020", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "abspara0020", "view": "all"}, "_": "Kim et\u00a0al. demonstrate that exercise-induced myokine irisin reduces A\u03b2 pathology using three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and delineates the key pathways through which irisin exerts neuroprotective effects.
