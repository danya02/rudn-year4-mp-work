But the maps may also include data about temperatures requested by the building heating systems (probably dependent on the building efficiency classes and the type of domestic hot water generation system) or any time series of either heat load or supply and return temperatures, respectively. Based on those data (steady or transient) cellular structures will be identified to be used for a more flexible operation of DH (district heating) networks or for re-designing new network topologies. The aim of these cells is the transition to locally flexible supply temperatures in the DH network: Each cell will be provided with an \u201cindividual\u201c supply temperature meeting its needs. This may open new perspectives to reduce heat losses and to integrate low emission heat sources."}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"view": "all", "id": "d1e279"}, "_": "Groups of heat consumers having both relatively closed-by positions in the urban heating system and similar supply temperature set points will be merged into a single DH cell.

The splitting of a DH system into a plenty of cells is demonstrated by means of an urban, unmeshed example network thus evaluating the suitability of the entire process.
