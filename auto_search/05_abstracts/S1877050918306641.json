To enhance the transmission distance and suppress the interference in directional ad hoc networks, multi-beam adaptive array (MBAA) is proposed. In this paper, a distributed low-redundancy information sharing algorithm (DLRA) is designed based on the receiver-oriented multiple access (ROMA). However, ROMA is an efficient scheduling MAC protocol that utilizes MBAA, it cannot guarantee the efficiency of information sharing with low redundancy and low energy consumption requirements. Aiming to solve the problem, our protocol inserts sub-slots in the scheduling access phase to exchange packet information in order to reduce the redundant data and accelerate the rate of information sharing. Finally, the performance of DLRA is compared with ROMA by simulations. DLRA shows a 20% lower redundancy rate and lower delay in information sharing, which demonstrates that our algorithm is a valid way to solve the similar problems."}]}]}]}}
