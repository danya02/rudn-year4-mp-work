Forthcoming deployment trends include densification of cells and convergence of the \u2018native IP\u2019 with cellular access networks with more than best-effort expectations. Greater meshing in networks due to practical deployment requirements is inevitable and needed. This paper proposes a routing protocol to address the \u201crandomness\u201d of topology interconnections, routing paths and sizes in emerging IP access networks. Termed as Minimum Set Cover (MSC) approach, it is a generalization of the NP and NP complete mathematical problem. The offline component of the MSC multiplies intra-domain routing installations, called Routing Planes (RPs) modelled as graphs, to suitably cover the whole routing topology prior to the traffic injections in the online component. We introduce novel offline optimization features using a dynamic cost function that plans availability of capacities and correlation of routing paths via the chosen set of RPs. Our simulations verify effective path diversity using MSC with its modest protocol overhead and a heuristic used for RPs selection. For randomly constructed access network topologies with 7, 18 and 33 routers and various meshing levels, our results show convincing suitability and key performances gains compared with rival routing solutions."}]}]}]}}
