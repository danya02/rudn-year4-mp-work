According to the World Health Organization, globally road traffic collisions are one of the leading and fastest growing causes of disability and death. The present research work is conducted on ten years of traffic accident data in an urban environment to explore and analyze spatial and temporal variation in the accidents and related injuries. The proposed spatiotemporal model can make predictions regarding the number of injuries incurred on individual road segments. Bayesian methodology using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) with Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) has been applied to generate a predicted risk map for the entire road network. The current study introduces INLA- SPDE modeling to perform spatiotemporal predictive analysis on selected areas, precisely on road networks instead of traditional continuous regions. Additionally, the result risk maps act as a baseline to identify the safe routes in a spatiotemporal context. The methodology can be adapted and applied to enhanced INLA-SPDE modeling of spatial point processes precisely on road networks."}]}]}]}}
