The transition to the electric vehicle requires an infrastructure of charging stations (CSs) with information technology, ingenious, distributed energy generation units, and favorable government policies. This paper discusses the key factors when planning electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This paper provides information about planning and technological developments that can be used to improve the design and implementation of charging station infrastructure. A comprehensive review of the current electric vehicle scenario, the impact of EVs on grid integration, and Electric Vehicle optimal allocation provisioning are presented. In particular, this paper analyzes research and developments related to charging station infrastructure, challenges, and efforts to standardize the infrastructure to enhance future research work. In addition, the optimal placement of rapid charging stations is based on economic benefits and grid impacts. It also describes the challenges of adoption. On the other hand, future trends in the field, such as energy procurement from renewable sources and cars\u2019 benefits to grid technology, are also presented and discussed."}]}]}]}}
