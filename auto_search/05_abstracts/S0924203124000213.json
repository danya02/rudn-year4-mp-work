In this paper we give a brief overview of the applications of spontaneous Raman imaging in bioanalysis and then consider what Raman imaging in 2050 might look like. We discuss the state of Raman imaging around its inception, then provide a snapshot of current technology, then look towards 2050. We then discuss some of the potential bottlenecks for the continuing development of Raman imaging for biological sample analysis and, where appropriate, outline approaches to overcome these challenges."}]}]}]}}
