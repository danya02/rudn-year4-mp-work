Finding the optimal placement of nodes is defined as the minimum expected path length (MEPL) problem. This is a generalization of the minimum linear arrangement (MLA) problem where the network infrastructure is a line and the computation is done centrally. In contrast to previous work, we study the distributed version and give efficient and simple approximation algorithms for interesting and practically relevant special cases of the problem. In particular, we consider grid networks in which the distribution of requests is a symmetric product distribution. In this setting, we show that a simple greedy policy of position switching between neighboring nodes to locally minimize an objective function achieves good approximation ratios. We are able to prove this result using the useful notions of expected rank of the distribution and the expected distance to the center of the graph."}]}]}]}]}}
