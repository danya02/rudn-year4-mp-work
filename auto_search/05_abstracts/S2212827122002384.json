To meet the agile philosophy in industry, data-driven algorithms need to handle growing complexity, particularly in Computer Numerical Control machining. To enhance the scalability of machine learning in real-world applications, this paper presents a benchmark dataset for process monitoring of brownfield milling machines based on acceleration data. The data is collected from a real-world production plant using a smart data collection system over a two-years period. In this work, the edge-to-cloud setup is presented followed by an extensive description of the different normal and abnormal processes. An analysis of the dataset highlights the challenges of machine learning in industry caused by the environmental and industrial factors. The new dataset is published with this paper and available at: https://github.com/boschresearch/CNC_Machining."}]}]}]}}
