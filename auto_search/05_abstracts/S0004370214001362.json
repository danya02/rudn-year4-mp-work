To generate recommendations, many systems rely on tag representations of music. Such systems, however, suffer from tag sparsity, whereby tracks lack a strong tag representation. Current state-of-the-art techniques that reduce this sparsity problem create hybrid systems using multiple representations, for example both content and tags. In this paper we present a novel hybrid representation that augments sparse tag representations without introducing content directly. Our hybrid representation integrates pseudo-tags learned from content into the tag representation of a track, and a dynamic weighting scheme limits the number of pseudo-tags that are allowed to contribute. Experiments demonstrate that this method allows tags to remain dominant when they provide a strong representation, and pseudo-tags to take over when tags are sparse. We show that our approach significantly improves recommendation quality not only for queries with a sparse tag representation but also those that are well-tagged. Our hybrid approach has potential to be extended to other music representations that are used for recommendation but suffer from data sparsity, such as user profiles."}]}]}]}}
