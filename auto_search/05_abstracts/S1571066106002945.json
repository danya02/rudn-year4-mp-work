We point out that there are some similarities between Rabin's trapdoor permutation and our proposal. Although our function is less efficient, it possesses a nice feature which is not known for modular squaring, namely there is a variant with a different and easy-to-handle domain. Thus it provides some advantages for practical applications. To confirm this statement, we develop a simple hybrid encryption scheme based on our proposed trapdoor permutation that is CCA-secure in the random oracle model."}]}]}]}]}}
