For the given network and connection requests, a minimum number of light trail is to be assigned such that all the given connection requests are satisfied. The approach is divided into three parts. First a Hamiltonian path is found and two light trails are set up along this path, one in the direct direction and other in the reverse direction. Next the traffic matrix (connection request) is divided into two matrices, called downstream matrix and upstream matrix. Next the traffic flow of the downstream matrix using direct light trail is satisfied. Then the upstream matrix using the reverse light trail is satisfied. This minimises the flow time and the number of light trail assigned to be two. The time complexity of the heuristic is computed to be O(n"}, {"#name": "sup", "$": {"loc": "post"}, "_": "2"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": "), where n is the number of nodes in the network. Major limitation of the presented heuristic is that it works only for topologies which have a Hamiltonian path in it."}]}]}]}]}}
