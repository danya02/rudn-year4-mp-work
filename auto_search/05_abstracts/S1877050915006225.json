DTNs have not custom to vindicate complete track from source to destination most of the time during communication. Existing data routing approaches used in DTNs were based on multi-copy routing. However, these existing methods incur overhead due to exorbitant transmissions and increases seer side processing. Hence there is a necessity to propose an optimal path routing algorithm to overcome the above issues. The optimal path routing reduces the proposition of message dropping and wax the throughput. The design approximate also uses random path generation that can reveal the path that affirms active connection for a longer duration to achieve a desired routing delay. In addition, this system has an effective buffer management mechanism to increase throughput and decrease routing delay. The analysis and as well as the simulation results clearly shows that the optimal path routing algorithm, provides high throughput and low routing delay compared to existing routing approaches."}]}]}]}}
