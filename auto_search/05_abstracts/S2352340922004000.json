The said study is further extended for 3 dimensional (3D) multilayer NoC Mesh topology with normal channels and without virtual channels over CBR and FTP traffic. These virtual channels are introduced over 2 layer 3D NoC model over-center sphere links, mid sphere links, peripheral sphere links, and all combined channels over various sphere links. The data for the 3D NoC model proposed was processed using Network Simulator-3(NS-3) software, while the throughputs and delay were processed with NS-2 Wireless Trace Analyzer."}]}]}]}}
