However, also in other kinds of systems, flexibility of querying, including but also going beyond the use of natural language, is an important feature. With this consideration in mind the paper presents a critical and comprehensive analysis of recent developments, trends and challenges of Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQASs). Flexible query answering is a multidisciplinary research field that is not limited to question answering in natural language, but comprises other query forms and interaction modalities, which aim to provide powerful means and techniques for better reflecting human preferences and intentions to retrieve relevant information. It adopts methods at the crossroad of several disciplines among which Information Retrieval (IR), databases, knowledge based systems, knowledge and data engineering, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the semantic web may be mentioned. The analysis principles are inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework, characterized by a top-down process, starting with relevant keywords for the topic of interest to retrieve relevant articles from meta-sources And complementing these articles with other relevant articles from seed sources Identified by a bottom-up process. to mine the retrieved publication data a network analysis is performed Which allows to present in a synthetic way intrinsic topics of the selected publications. issues dealt with are related to query answering methods Both model-based and data-driven (the latter based on either machine learning or deep learning) And to their needs for explainability and fairness to deal with big data Notably by taking into account data veracity. conclusions point out trends and challenges to help better shaping the future of the FQAS field."}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "graphical", "id": "d1e1500", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1501"}, "_": "Graphical abstract"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1503", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1504", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "display", "$$": [{"#name": "figure", "$": {"id": "dfig1"}, "$$": [{"#name": "link", "$": {"xmlns:xlink": true, "id": "d1e1508", "locator": "ga1", "href": "pii:S0169023X23001064/ga1", "role": "http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4"}}]}]}]}]}]}, {"#name": "abstract", "$": {"class": "author-highlights", "id": "d1e1509", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "d1e1510"}, "_": "Highlights"}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "d1e1512", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "d1e1513", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list", "$": {"id": "d1e1515"}, "$$": [{"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1516"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1519", "view": "all"}, "_": "Top-down and Bottom-up analysis of research literature on Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQASs) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1521"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1524", "view": "all"}, "_": "Network and temporal Analysis of Bibliographic data on FQASs to reveal main application contexts, main methods, interrelations, and temporal trends."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1526"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1529", "view": "all"}, "_": "Semantics classification of approaches with respect to types of information dealt with, types of queries and answers, types of systems, implementations characteristics, etc."}]}, {"#name": "list-item", "$": {"id": "d1e1531"}, "$$": [{"#name": "label", "_": "\u2022"}, {"#name": "para", "$": {"id": "d1e1534", "view": "all"}, "_": "Identification of recent trends and future challenges and opportunities for the FQAS field."}]}]}]}]}]}]}}
