Automatic extraction of semantic relation between pair of nouns is an important task with many potential applications like information retrieval, information extraction, text summarization, machine translation, question answering, thesaurus construction and word sense disambiguation. This paper describes an approach that extracts hypernym and meronym relation between proper nouns in sentences of a given text. Here machine learning techniques are used to automatically extract proper nouns with a given relationship from a text corpus. This work is based on dependency parsing with ADTree and Naive Bayes classifier. The approach is based on the analysis of the paths between noun pairs in the dependency parse trees of the sentences."}]}]}]}}
