The primary problem such recommendation models solve is to precisely match information with users and, in so doing, ensure that news spreads with greater efficiency. However, these techniques only help the media platform; they do not help those who produce the news. Hence, we devised a propagation framework based on a human-in-the-loop simulation that helps content authors maximize the spread of their messages through social networks. The framework works by acting on feedback provided by the simulation model. Additionally, the spread of information is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem in which propagation is data-driven and simulated with machine learning techniques that leverage data on the historical behaviors of users. We additionally describe an implementation for this framework as an example of how the framework might be used in real life. On the practical side, the implementation uses text data from a blog to simulate the message's propagation, while, from a technical point of view, the multi-objective optimization problem is divided into an information retrieval problem and an integer programming problem, the results of which are fed back into the content editor as content operation strategies. A case study with the Sina Weibo microblog site not only validates the framework but also provides practitioners with insights into how to maximize the spread of information through social networking platforms. The results show that the proposed propagation framework is capable of increasing retweets by 7.9575 %. As an interesting aside, our experiments also show that the Weibo retweet lottery is both popular and a highly effective mechanism for increasing reposts."}]}]}]}}
