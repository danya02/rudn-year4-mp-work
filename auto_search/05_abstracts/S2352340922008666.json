PyNomo nomographer supports nine basic types of nomograms based on the format of the mathematical equation. The examined PyNomo codes cover the construction of the following types of nomogram: type 1, type 2, type 7, type 8, type 9, and type 10. Each PyNomo script includes some background and the underlying mathematics for the nomogram construction and how to implement each code into PyNomo software. Potential users can use these PyNomo codes, as template scripts, to customize and construct their own nomograms for a variety of technical applications. That is especially true since a considerable number of science and engineering equations fall into one of these covered nomogram types depending on the equation form involved."}]}]}]}}
