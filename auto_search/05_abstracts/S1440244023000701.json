These environments result from the interactions between tissue motion, loading, biology, and morphology. Maintaining health of and/or repairing joint tissues requires targeting the \u201cideal\u201d in vivo tissue mechanics (i.e., loading and strain), which may be enabled by real-time biofeedback. Recent research has shown that these biofeedback technologies are possible by integrating a patient's personalised digital twin and wireless wearable devices. Personalised digital twins are personalised neuromusculoskeletal rigid body and finite element models that work in real-time by code optimisation and artificial intelligence. Model personalisation is crucial in obtaining physically and physiologically valid predictions."}]}, {"#name": "abstract-sec", "$": {"id": "as0025", "view": "all"}, "$$": [{"#name": "section-title", "$": {"id": "st0030"}, "_": "Conclusions"}, {"#name": "simple-para", "$": {"id": "sp0025", "view": "all"}, "_": "Recent work has shown that laboratory-quality biomechanical measurements and modelling can be performed outside the laboratory with a small number of wearable sensors or computer vision methods.
