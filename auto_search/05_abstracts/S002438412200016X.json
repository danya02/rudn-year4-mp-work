It will be argued that invariable tag questions are as much part of the tag question system as variable tag questions, and that a unified functional model needs to consider both types in order to compare function-to-form mappings and reveal language variation, as well as the factors motivating their use. This study proposes one such model comprising eight functional types of tag questions, i.e., "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "informational"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "affective"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "challenging"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "hortatory"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "facilitative"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "focusing"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "phatic"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": " and "}, {"#name": "italic", "_": "regulatory"}, {"#name": "__text__", "_": ", in relation to four clusters of grammatical, dialogic, generic and sociolinguistic features. Based on the analysis of 539 invariable tag questions in British English and European Portuguese, results show that the constructions are more frequent and functionally varied in Portuguese (N\u00a0=\u00a0397 vs. 142). In addition, based on statistical analyses, corresponding multi-feature prediction models are obtained for the proposed functional types of invariable tag questions in the two languages under inspection, thereby uncovering novel contributions to the pragmatics of invariable tag questions within the tag question paradigm."}]}]}]}]}}
