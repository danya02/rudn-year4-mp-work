Long-term noise exposure can result in a series of physical and mental health diseases that are highly harmful to foetuses and newborns. Hence, many IoT-based wireless sensor network systems have been proposed for automated monitoring for long-term operation. However, these systems suffer from weaknesses in functionality, power consumption, costs, and scalability, which hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a distributed hierarchical wireless acoustic sensor network for environmental noise monitoring to do sound classification and A-weighted sound-pressure-level measurement to address the shortcomings of existing systems. A series of tests and comparisons are performed in diagnosing the performance with respect to recording continuity, packet loss, recording quality, accuracy on A-weighted sound pressure level calculations, and costs. Results show that this proposed network structure is feasible as a part of hardware implementation in a large-scale, low-cost, and high-scalable environmental noise monitoring system to classify sound."}]}]}]}}
