The text discusses the deployment of a dense indoor sensor network using Long Range Wide Area Network (LR-WAN) technology, which is an alternative for creating indoor sensor networks. The authors evaluate the performance of their system over two years, analyze transmission data, and explore the application of LR-WAN for passive sensing and visualization of human presence in buildings.\n\nThe abstract mentions several key aspects that align with the scoping review:\n\n1. IoT: The text discusses the deployment of a dense indoor sensor network, which is a common use case for IoT applications.\n2. Autonomous robots and similar industrial applications: Although not explicitly mentioned, the focus on industrial applications and the development of a sensor network imply connections to autonomous robots or similar systems.\n3. Routing protocols: While not directly discussed, the abstract mentions the evaluation of transmission data, which implies an analysis of routing protocols and their performance in a specific context.\n\nHowever, the abstract does not explicitly discuss routing protocols for unknown or changing network topology, fault tolerance, or techniques like multipath routing, which were mentioned as excluded concepts in the scoping review.
