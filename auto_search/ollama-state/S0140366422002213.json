Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe abstract discusses orchestration solutions for 5G/6G networks, which involves managing complex network topologies, services, and technologies. While 5G/6G networks are not specifically focused on wireless mesh networks or IoT, the challenges and requirements mentioned in the abstract (e.g., latency, reliability, availability) could be applicable to ad-hoc networks used in IoT applications. The mention of distributed and automated solutions also aligns with the need for fault-tolerant and adaptive routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, I think the relevance is not direct enough to confirm its inclusion in your scoping review without further analysis.
