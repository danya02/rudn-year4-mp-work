The primary emphasis is on Z-Wave's security vulnerabilities rather than routing protocols in general.\n2.

The abstract does not explicitly discuss techniques for improving throughput or fault tolerance, which are key aspects of the scoping review.\n\nDespite these considerations, some connections can be made between this study's findings and the broader topic:\n\n1.
