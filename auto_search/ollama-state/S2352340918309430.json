The mention of \"topology\" might imply some relevance to network topology, although this is not explicitly stated.\n2. The evaluation criteria mentioned, such as latency, jitter, round-trip time, and goodput, could be relevant to understanding the impact of different routing protocols on network performance in IoT or similar applications.\n\nHowever, I would say that this article is not entirely relevant because:\n\n1. It focuses on bandwidth allocation models rather than routing protocols.\n2.
