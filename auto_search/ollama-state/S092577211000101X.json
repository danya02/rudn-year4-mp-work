The context of the abstract focuses on wireless networks and unit disc graphs, which is relevant to the scoping review as it deals with Wireless Mesh Networks (WLANETs) and IoT applications.\n2. Although the specific problem discussed in the abstract is the geometric k-centre problem, its relation to routing protocols in WLANETs and fault tolerance seems indirect at first glance.
