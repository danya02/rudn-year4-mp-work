The paper focuses on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), which aligns with the specified Population.\n2. It specifically addresses routing protocols, although not explicitly stated as such, the paper does deal with algorithms that improve network performance, routing decisions and management in WMNs.\n3.

Use of Markov modeling for wavelength congestion prediction in WDM-TDM, which seems to be outside the scope of the review.\n2.
