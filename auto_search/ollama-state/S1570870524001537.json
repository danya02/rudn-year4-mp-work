While the focus of the original scoping review is on routing protocols for changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput in IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications, the proposed algorithms do aim to optimize network capacity and reduce computation time in WMNs.\n\nHowever, there are a few aspects that make this abstract relevant:\n\n1. Routing protocols: Although the focus is not on traditional routing protocols, the proposed algorithms for path selection can be seen as part of the broader context of routing protocol optimization.\n2. Fault tolerance and network topology: The WMN scenario described in the abstract involves uncertainty paths and potential performance degradation, which could be related to fault-tolerant and adaptive network topologies.\n3. Improving throughput: The primary goal of the proposed algorithms is to maximize E2E throughput in WMNs.\n\nDespite these connections, I would argue that this abstract does not directly align with the specific focus on routing protocols, fault tolerance, and throughput optimization for IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications.
