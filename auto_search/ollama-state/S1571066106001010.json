The focus on simulators for MANETs is also relevant to the scoping review's interest in routing protocols for changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and techniques for improving throughput.\n\nAlthough the abstract does not directly discuss these specific topics, it addresses the broader theme of wireless networks and simulation tools, which are related to the scoping review's objectives.
