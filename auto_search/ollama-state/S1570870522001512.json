The topic of the paper, full-duplex (FD) wireless communication, falls within the scope of wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, which is specified in the context of the scoping review.\n2. Although the focus is on FD MAC protocols, the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology is related to the scoping review's Context section, which excludes traditional routing protocols but might include other techniques for improving throughput like multipath routing (which is not the case here).\n3. The abstract discusses the design of a medium access control protocol (MAC protocol) that can maximize transmission capacity in multihop wireless networks. This relates to the scoping review's Concept section, which focuses on routing protocols and fault tolerance.\n4. However, the focus of this paper is specifically on FD MAC protocols, suppressing self-interference (SI) and inter-user interference (IUI), and proposing a novel protocol for maximizing transmission capacity.
