The topic of pervasive adaptation, mentioned in the abstract, also seems relevant as it involves intelligent systems that can autonomously recognize situations and adapt to changes, similar to autonomous robots and other industrial applications mentioned in the scoping review.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of wireless communication, ubiquitous sensors, and passive or semi-passive RFID technologies aligns with the context of wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT, which is the focus of the scoping review.
