While WMNs may use similar techniques, this abstract seems more focused on Wi-Fi device capabilities rather than the routing protocols or topology management relevant to WMNs.\n* There's no mention of network topology changes, fault tolerance, throughput improvements, or multipath routing, which are key concepts in WMNs.\n* However, the study does discuss the impact of increasing burst sizes on ranging performance and how this might affect data transmission among Wi-Fi users. This could be related to WMNs if we consider the potential for increased interference or congestion in a network with multiple devices.\n\nGiven these points, I would say that while there is some tangential relevance to WMNs due to the discussion of networking issues (e.g., interference), the abstract seems more focused on Wi-Fi device capabilities rather than WMN-specific concepts.
