The emphasis on developing new types of smart grid communication and detecting and thwarting major assaults on routing protocols further supports its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, the abstract does mention \"Smart Grids\" explicitly, whereas the scoping review focuses specifically on IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications using wireless mesh networks.
