Although the paper discusses power systems, it does so within the context of resilience and self-restoration, which are also themes relevant to WMNs and their use in IoT environments. The absence of policies for power network resilience may be seen as analogous to the need for standardized routing protocols or fault-tolerant mechanisms in WMNs.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on models for smarter, cleaner, and more resilient systems is likely to be applicable to WMNs, which aim to improve reliability and efficiency in IoT applications.
