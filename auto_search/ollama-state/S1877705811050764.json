While the context is not directly related to IoT, autonomous robots, or industrial applications, there is a potential overlap in the area of smart infrastructure and building management systems that might involve wireless mesh networks (e.g., for monitoring temperature and air quality). Additionally, the model's focus on predicting thermal parameters could be relevant to industrial settings, such as those using wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that this study is primarily focused on developing a new prediction model for mines, rather than investigating routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput in wireless mesh networks.
