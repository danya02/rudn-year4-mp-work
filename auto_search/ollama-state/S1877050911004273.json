The focus on using ad-hoc solutions without databases or user space programs to share location data via GPS also relates to the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing network topology (Section 3), as the proposed system utilizes a filesystem structure for efficient exchange of data.\n\nHowever, there is some indirect relevance. The use of an ad-hoc solution using Linux and Android devices does not explicitly relate to wireless mesh networks or IoT applications focused on autonomous robots and industrial uses.
