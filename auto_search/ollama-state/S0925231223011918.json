However, it also touches on a more general issue of security threats in CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems), which may indirectly relate to the scoping review's focus on wireless mesh networks.\n* While the abstract mentions \"Intrusion Detection Systems\" (IDS) commonly used in IT networks, this is not directly related to routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput in wireless mesh networks. Instead, it seems to be more focused on anomaly detection and security threats in general.\n* The mention of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for behavior-based anomaly detection in OT networks may seem relevant due to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.
