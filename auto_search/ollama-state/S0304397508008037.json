WMNs are indeed used in IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications that are also excluded from the review. The maximum edge coloring problem discussed in this abstract seems to be related to routing protocols and dealing with changing network topology, which is a relevant concept for the scoping review.\n\nThe specific technique mentioned, a polynomial time approximation algorithm, is also relevant as it aims to improve throughput in WMNs, although the focus on channel assignment and not directly on multipath routing or throughput improvement makes it somewhat tangential. Nevertheless, its relevance to improving performance in WMNs makes it worth considering.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18003656234, "load_duration": 17288224, "prompt_eval_count": 395, "prompt_eval_duration": 6701000000, "eval_count": 168, "eval_duration": 11281000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:08:02.954846624Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT applications, with an emphasis on fault tolerance and network topology changes.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.
