While it mentions graph problem formulations and optimization techniques, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and dynamic programming, these concepts are also relevant to the context of wireless mesh networks (WMNs), especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n\nThe relevance is established through several connections:\n\n1. Optimization techniques: Many routing protocols in WMNs aim to minimize latency or maximize throughput under changing network conditions. Some optimization algorithms mentioned in the abstract, like Dijkstra's algorithm, may also be used in WMN routing.\n2. Graph problem formulations: Routing problems in WMNs can often be modeled as graph optimization problems, similar to those discussed in the maritime industry context.\n3. Challenges in decision making: Both WMNs and maritime industries face challenges in making optimal decisions under uncertain conditions.\n\nHowever, there are some differences between the two contexts that limit direct relevance:\n\n1. Different network characteristics: Maritime routing deals with dynamic weather patterns, ocean currents, and other environmental factors, whereas WMN routing typically involves changes in node positions, network topology, or interference.\n2.
