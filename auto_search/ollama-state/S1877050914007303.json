Context: The paper is discussed in the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications, which falls within the scope of the review.\n\n3. Concept: However, the concept of EASB (Energy Aware and SLA Based) routing mechanism and its improvement is not directly related to the concepts of routing protocols for changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, or multipath routing mentioned in the review.\n\n4. Technique: The technique used in this paper, which involves pre-populating a routing table and using it to determine the optimal route, may be relevant to the topic of efficient routing protocols in wireless mesh networks. However, its application to GMPLS networks makes it less directly relevant to the review's focus on wireless mesh networks.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that this paper is not highly relevant to the scoping review due to its specific focus on GMPLS networks and its limited applicability to the concepts and techniques being discussed in the review."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18742802992, "load_duration": 17563169, "prompt_eval_count": 262, "prompt_eval_duration": 64000000, "eval_count": 278, "eval_duration": 18658000000, "verdict": null}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:55:54.158106677Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine if this abstract is relevant to the scoping review, let's analyze it:\n\n* The Population is Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT, as stated in the scoping review.\n* However, the paper introduces an improvement for GMPLS networks, which is a type of network that uses Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching.
