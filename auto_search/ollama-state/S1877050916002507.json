Although WMNs might be used in some IoT applications that involve real-time multimedia transmissions, this abstract primarily focuses on VoIP performance over traditional IP networks.\n\nHowever, it does touch upon issues related to bandwidth, QoS requirements, and performance metrics (e.g., media access delay and throughput) that are relevant to the scoping review's context of WMNs and IoT applications. Additionally, some aspects, such as node density effects on voice transmission, could be applicable to WMNs.\n\nGiven these connections, I believe this abstract is partially relevant to the scoping review, but with some caveats regarding the primary focus on VoIP over traditional IP networks rather than WMNs specifically.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15183121996, "load_duration": 18907215, "prompt_eval_count": 353, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 224, "eval_duration": 15095000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:13:29.183070299Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThis abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it discusses wireless technologies, particularly in the context of wireless mesh networks (although not explicitly stated, the mention of \"wireless network\" aligns with the focus on ad-hoc and IoT networks). The main focus is on Voice over IP (VOIP) performance, which intersects with the concept of routing protocols and fault tolerance in network topology. Although the abstract does not directly discuss routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput, it touches on aspects related to wireless networks, node behavior (in terms of voice transmission), and network parameters that could be relevant to routing protocol performance.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the main focus of the paper seems more geared towards evaluating VOIP performance under different conditions rather than exploring routing protocols specifically.
