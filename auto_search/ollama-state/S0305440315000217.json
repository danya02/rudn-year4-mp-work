The study explores the shifting focus from the core of the city to its outer zones, reflecting changes in the broader exotics commerce network.\n\nWhile the abstract appears to be focused on archaeobotanical data and historical analysis, it touches on themes related to:\n\n1. Network dynamics: The study examines how distribution patterns change over time, which is relevant to understanding network behavior, including routing protocols.\n2. Topology and spatial relationships: The authors analyze density surfaces and social/spatial networks, which can be seen as analogous to understanding network topology in the context of wireless mesh networks or IoT applications.\n\nHowever, there are a few key differences between this abstract and the scoping review's scope:\n\n1. Focus on routing protocols is absent: The abstract does not explicitly discuss routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput.\n2. Application areas differ: While the study focuses on historical archaeobotanical data, the scoping review targets IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications.\n\nDespite these differences, I believe that this abstract could be considered relevant to the scoping review because it:\n\n1. Discusses network dynamics and spatial relationships, which are related to routing protocols in a broader sense.\n2.
