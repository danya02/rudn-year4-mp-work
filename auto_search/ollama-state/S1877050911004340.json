The abstract specifically mentions WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks), mesh topology, and techniques for improving efficiency in ad-hoc networks. These topics align with the exclusion criteria mentioned earlier (excluding urban infrastructure, emergency response networks, military operations) but are still relevant to IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications.\n\nThe abstract also discusses routing protocols specifically dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, which is another key aspect of wireless mesh networks and falls within the scope of the review.
