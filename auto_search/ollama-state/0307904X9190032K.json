Wireless Mesh Networks: The abstract does not explicitly mention wireless mesh networks, but the discussion of telephone networks might be seen as tangentially related to telecommunications networks that might be comparable.\n2. Routing protocols: While routing protocols are mentioned in the abstract, it appears to focus on modeling links in series and transit paths in a context that is more relevant to traditional telephone networks rather than ad-hoc or IoT wireless mesh networks.\n3.
