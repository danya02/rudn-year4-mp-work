While the topic of vehicular networks may seem unrelated to wireless mesh networks at first glance, there are some connections worth noting.\n\nFirstly, both vehicular networks and wireless mesh networks involve networks that can be prone to cyber attacks. The proposed scheme in the abstract is designed to address security concerns in vehicular systems, which could also be relevant to industrial applications or IoT networks that use autonomous robots.\n\nSecondly, the concept of revocation, which is a key aspect of the proposal, is closely related to fault tolerance and routing protocols, as it deals with quickly removing compromised nodes from the network. This makes the abstract relevant to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.\n\nFinally, the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in the proposed scheme could be seen as a technique that improves throughput or performance in network systems, although this is not explicitly stated in the abstract.
