Here's why:\n\n1. The focus is on wireless mesh networks, which matches the population of interest (Wireless Mesh Networks).\n2. Although the paper discusses microcontrollers and LoRa technology, it also deals with routing protocols, fault tolerance, and distributed application performance, all of which are relevant to the concept of this scoping review.\n3. However, there's a slight deviation from the context specified in the scoping review (industrial applications like IoT, autonomous robots) since the paper focuses on a machine learning task (keyword spotting).
