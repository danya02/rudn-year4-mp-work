The focus is on analyzing and verifying the correctness and performance of MTIP in the context of Tactile Internet applications. While the research may touch on aspects related to wireless mesh networks, such as network topology and fault tolerance, which are also relevant to the scoping review, the primary emphasis is on the development and evaluation of a specific protocol (MTIP) for a particular application area (Tactile Internet).\n\nHowever, there is no direct mention of routing protocols in the traditional sense or techniques like multipath routing that were explicitly excluded from the scoping review. Instead, MTIP seems to be focused on enhancing communication through multiple paths, which might not directly relate to routing protocols.\n\nThat being said, the abstract does discuss \"multipath transport protocol,\" which is related to routing and network topology. Therefore, it could potentially be relevant to the scoping review if the inclusion criterion is broad enough to include research on network topology, routing, or protocols in general.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems that the primary focus of the abstract is on the development and evaluation of a novel protocol (MTIP) for a specific application area (Tactile Internet), rather than exploring aspects of wireless mesh networks or routing protocols per se.
