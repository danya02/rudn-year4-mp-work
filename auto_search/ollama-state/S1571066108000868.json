While the topic of the paper seems unrelated to Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) at first glance, there are some connections worth considering.\n\nFirstly, WMNs often rely on wireless links, which can be subject to latency and congestion issues. The concept of latency insensitive network fabric protocols might be relevant in this context, as it could help improve the performance and efficiency of WMN routing decisions.\n\nSecondly, WMNs are frequently used for IoT applications, autonomous robots, and similar industrial use cases, where synchronizing data across devices is crucial. The paper's focus on clock synchronization using elastic interfaces and asynchronous buffering might be relevant in this context, as it could help improve the performance and reliability of WMN-based systems.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, there seems to be no direct connection between the abstract's topics and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.
