Additionally, the abstract's focus on experimentation and performance evaluation could provide insights into the performance of routing protocols in dynamic networks, which is a topic of interest in this scoping review.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the specific focus on IPsec SAs might not be directly applicable to ad-hoc or mesh networking, which are likely the main areas of interest for this scoping review.
