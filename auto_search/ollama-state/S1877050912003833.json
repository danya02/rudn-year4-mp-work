While the topic of reprogramming itself might not be directly related to routing protocols, it does involve network topology changes (when updating nodes or extending the network) and fault tolerance (as it involves correcting functionality after deployment). Additionally, data compression techniques mentioned in the abstract can indirectly relate to improving throughput by reducing transmission overhead.\n\nHowever, there is no explicit mention of routing protocols or adapting to changing and unknown network topology.
