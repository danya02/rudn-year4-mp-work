The context mentioned in the abstract, such as IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications, aligns with the excluded contexts specified in the scoping review.

The authors' proposal focuses on optimizing network performance and reducing communication costs using low-power and less complex protocols like IEEE 802.15.4.

Since FANETs share similarities with traditional ad-hoc networks in terms of node mobility, topology changes, and potential for improved performance through optimized routing protocols, this study is relevant to the scoping review.\n2. **IoT Application**: The abstract mentions IoT applications, which are also within the scope of the scoping review.

Since routing protocols are a key aspect of wireless mesh and ad-hoc networks, this analysis is directly related to the scoping review's focus on improving throughput and fault tolerance.\n4. **Scalability and Quality of Service**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, scalability and Quality of Service (QoS) are also relevant aspects of wireless mesh and ad-hoc networks.\n\nHowever, there are some potential issues with relevance:\n\n1. **Exclusion criteria**: The review excludes emergency response networks, military operations, and urban infrastructure, which may not be directly applicable to FANETs.\n2. **Specificity of application**: While FANETs share similarities with other ad-hoc networks, their unique aspects (e.g., flying UAVs) might limit the direct applicability of the results.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **yes**.
