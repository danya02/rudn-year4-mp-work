The focus is on comparing their energy consumption, delay, throughput, and packet loss rates. However, this study seems to be conducted using Network Simulator and does not explicitly mention wireless mesh networks or IoT applications.\n\nSince the scoping review specifically focuses on ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks, routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and techniques for improving throughput (excluding multipath routing), the abstract's focus on mobile WSNs may not be directly relevant to the scoping review. The absence of any explicit mention of these key aspects makes it uncertain whether this study aligns with the scope.\n\nHowever, if we consider that wireless mesh networks can also apply to IoT and industrial applications (as mentioned in the context), then there might be some relevance, albeit indirect.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17089732958, "load_duration": 17502830, "prompt_eval_count": 267, "prompt_eval_duration": 3202000000, "eval_count": 208, "eval_duration": 13868000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:31:55.998766074Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThis abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it focuses on wireless mesh networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT applications, which aligns with the population of interest.
