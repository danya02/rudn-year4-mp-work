The focus on classic Bluetooth and BLE technologies aligns with the scoping review's emphasis on Wireless Mesh Networks, particularly those using Bluetooth.\n\nThe abstract also provides a unique perspective by discussing the work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks, which distinguishes it from existing surveys.
