The focus on wireless communication systems that can operate in challenging environments (e.g., sea test with objects blocking line of sight) aligns with the industrial applications (autonomous robots and similar) mentioned in the scoping review.\n2. The use of LoRa technology, which is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) solution, is relevant to the scoping review on wireless mesh networks for IoT.\n3. The development of a communication packet header at the application layer to enable peer-to-peer communication between nodes suggests an attempt to address routing protocol challenges in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract focuses primarily on the performance and implementation details of the proposed system rather than the theoretical aspects of routing protocols or fault tolerance.
