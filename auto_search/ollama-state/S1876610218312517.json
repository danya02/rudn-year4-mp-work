The Concept is Routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance.\n\nThis abstract discusses a Smart Grid Network (SGN) using Cooperative Wireless Transmission for Smart Neighbor Area Network (CWT), which involves wireless communication and coordination between consumers to transmit power demand. While SGN is not directly related to the Population of interest, it shares some similarities with IoT applications that require efficient and reliable data transmission.\n\nHowever, there are significant differences in the context: SGN is a traditional grid-based system, whereas the scoping review focuses on ad-hoc and IoT networks. The abstract's focus on Cooperative Wireless Transmission and modulation schemes might not be directly relevant to the routing protocols and fault tolerance discussed in the scoping review.\n\nThat being said, the overall direction of research in wireless communication and coordination (as seen in CWT) is somewhat related to the topic of routing protocols and fault tolerance in ad-hoc and IoT networks.
