The topic of the paper is WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) networks, which is a type of network that might be used in certain IoT applications, but it is not directly related to wireless mesh networks or ad-hoc networks.\n2. The focus of the paper is on survivability and protection strategies for networks, specifically dynamic hybrid protection schemes.
