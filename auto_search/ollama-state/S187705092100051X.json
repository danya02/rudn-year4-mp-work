However, considering that wireless mesh networks often rely on interconnection networks to connect nodes and manage data transmission, this topic could be relevant to understanding the challenges of managing network topology and performance.\n2.

However, it touches on the importance of network topology and its effects on performance.\n2. The introduction of a new hierarchical interconnection network (MTN) is relevant because it explores alternative network topologies that can improve fault tolerance and performance in dynamic environments, which is similar to what is being studied in wireless mesh networks.\n3.
