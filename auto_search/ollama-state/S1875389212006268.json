Concept: The abstract deals with routing protocols, specifically QAODV, which is a QoS-aware protocol aimed at improving throughput and fault tolerance in WMNs. While it doesn't explicitly mention techniques for improving throughput like multipath routing, its focus on QoS and routing makes it relevant to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, I do note that the abstract does discuss performance metrics (throughput and end-to-end delay) that might be tangentially related to some of the excluded concepts.
