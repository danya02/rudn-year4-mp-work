It also introduces a new approach for addressing these issues, which is based on adaptive aggregation techniques tailored to specific IoT traffic types. This approach aims to optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks.\n\nThe abstract mentions that existing aggregation techniques have limitations, specifically overlooking the unique characteristics of IoT traffic. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are designed to address this gap by reducing packet headers and minimizing data transmission during low-traffic congestion periods.\n\nWhile the abstract focuses on the benefits of the proposed approach for optimizing network efficiency in smart city IoT networks, it does not explicitly discuss routing protocols or the handling of changing network topology and fault tolerance.
