The modified protocol aims to improve performance by dividing the backoff delay into main and secondary backoffs, which is related to techniques for improving throughput.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract mentions the use of a Markov model to assess the behavior of the modified CSMA/CA protocol and derive expressions for average delay, energy consumption, and reliability.
