While sEMG technology can be used in various applications, including rehabilitation settings, it does not directly relate to the specific focus on Wireless Mesh Networks or IoT.\n3.

The proposed sEMG sensor system can be used to monitor and analyze human movements and gestures in industrial applications, such as autonomous robots.\n2. The use of wireless data acquisition systems in the context of sEMG sensors could potentially integrate with Wireless Mesh Networks, although this is not explicitly mentioned.\n\nConsidering these indirect connections and the overall focus of the abstract, I would say that the abstract is \"not directly relevant\" to the scoping review on Wireless Mesh Networks.

The context: The abstract discusses an application of wireless mesh networks, specifically in the field of IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications (hand rehabilitation). Although the primary focus is on hand gesture recognition, the underlying technology used is relevant to the broader context of wireless mesh networks.\n2. The population: The study focuses on patients with stroke for hand function rehabilitation, which aligns with the excluded populations mentioned in the scoping review (emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure).\n3. The concept: While the abstract does not explicitly discuss routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput, it does touch upon the aspect of \"stable interface between electrodes and skin,\" which might be related to fault tolerance in wireless sensor systems.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would argue that this abstract is tangentially relevant to the scoping review.
