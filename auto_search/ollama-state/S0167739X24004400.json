Although LF is a specific application of Federated Learning, it deals with routing protocols issues that are relevant to the scoping review. The main theme of the abstract revolves around how LF techniques address challenges in adapting FL to real-world IoT scenarios.\n\nThe fact that the abstract discusses lightweight FL, which can be seen as a technique for improving communication conditions and fault tolerance in network topology, suggests that it is relevant to the topic of routing protocols in wireless mesh networks. Furthermore, the focus on overcoming limitations imposed by resource-constrained devices aligns with the need for developing more efficient and resilient routing protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract mentions exploring the challenges and future directions of LF, which could be seen as an extension of the scoping review's objectives.
