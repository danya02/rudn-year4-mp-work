However, the context of IoT and dynamic access control systems might be related to WMNs in certain aspects.\n\n2. **Context**: The abstract focuses on building safety and security, which is an application domain for WMNs and IoT, but its specific focus on \"smart ambient access control\" seems more tailored to a particular use case rather than addressing the core concepts of WMNs and routing protocols.\n\n3. **Concepts**: The abstract doesn't explicitly discuss routing protocols or techniques like multipath routing, nor does it address fault tolerance or adapting to changing network topology in WMNs specifically. However, the ideas of dynamic security classification and zone configuration could be tangentially related to WMN design or optimization.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would conclude that this abstract is **not directly relevant** to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and techniques for managing changing and unknown network topology in ad-hoc and IoT WMNs.
