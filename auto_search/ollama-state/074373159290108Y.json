Although the main topic of the paper is packet routing on a mesh-connected computer for parallel computation, it addresses two important criteria for judging a routing algorithm: run time (number of parallel steps) and queue size (maximum number of packets stored at any node). These criteria are relevant to improving fault tolerance and throughput in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the abstract's focus on packet routing algorithms for parallel computation does not directly address routing protocols specifically designed for changing and unknown network topology, which is a key aspect of the scoping review.
