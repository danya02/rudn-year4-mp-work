The proposed approach considers the impact of interference on node power consumption.\n\nThe context mentioned in the scoping review, specifically IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications, is relevant here because:\n\n* Energy conservation is a critical concern for IoT devices with limited battery life.\n* Interference can be particularly problematic in industrial settings where devices may be deployed in close proximity to each other, leading to interference issues.\n\nThe abstract also touches on the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, which is another relevant aspect of the scoping review.
