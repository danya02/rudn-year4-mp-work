It introduces an interference-aware routing protocol that aims to minimize both transmission cost (energy spent on sending packets) and reception cost (energy spent on receiving unwanted signals from interfering nodes). The proposed approach considers the impact of interference on node power consumption.\n\nThe context mentioned in the scoping review, specifically IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications, is relevant here because:\n\n* Energy conservation is a critical concern for IoT devices with limited battery life.\n* Interference can be particularly problematic in industrial settings where devices may be deployed in close proximity to each other, leading to interference issues.\n\nThe abstract also touches on the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, which is another relevant aspect of the scoping review. The proposed protocol aims to address these challenges by minimizing energy consumption while considering interference effects.\n\nOverall, the abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review as it addresses critical issues in wireless networking that are also relevant to IoT and industrial applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15249118981, "load_duration": 16842365, "prompt_eval_count": 300, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 226, "eval_duration": 15163000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:58:14.29006231Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review as it:\n\n1.
