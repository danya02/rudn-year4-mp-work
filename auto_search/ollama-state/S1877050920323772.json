While the topic may seem unrelated at first glance, there are some potential connections to be made with the scoping review on wireless mesh networks for IoT applications.\n\nHere's why I think it might be relevant:\n\n1. **Autonomous monitoring**: Hydrographical systems, especially those involving canals, often require real-time monitoring and control. Wireless mesh networks could potentially be used to deploy sensors and other devices that provide autonomous monitoring capabilities, which is a common theme in wireless mesh networks for IoT applications.\n2. **Fault tolerance**: In the context of hydrographical systems, fault tolerance is crucial to ensure that critical operations can continue even in the event of failures or disruptions. Wireless mesh networks are known for their ability to self-heal and adapt to changes, which could be beneficial in ensuring the reliability of these systems.\n3. **Predictive maintenance**: The concept of digital twins and simulation-based decision-making might be seen as related to predictive maintenance strategies that rely on sensor data from IoT devices.

While this topic may seem unrelated to wireless mesh networks at first glance, there are a few connections worth noting. Firstly, the concept of data collection and control through remote systems is also relevant to wireless mesh networks, as they often rely on data transmission and management to function effectively.\n\nMoreover, the use of digital twins in simulating and optimizing network behavior can be seen as analogous to the routing protocols discussed in the scoping review. Just as digital twins aim to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a hydrographical system, routing protocols aim to optimize the performance of wireless mesh networks by adapting to changing network topology.\n\nHowever, there are also significant differences between this abstract and the scope of the scoping review.
