The focus is on improving routing efficiency and fault tolerance in the presence of changing network topology, which aligns with the excluded aspects mentioned in the scope. Additionally, the emphasis on routing algorithms and their performance characteristics (e.g., runtime, probability) suggests that the abstract contributes to the discussion of routing protocols for wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, there is a slight concern that this abstract might be slightly off-topic due to the specific focus on optical busses and high-dimensional meshes of optical busses (MOBs).
