The topic of mobile data offloading is initially presented as a promising approach to tackle network congestion, which is also a concern in wireless mesh networks and IoT applications.\n2. Although the initial part of the abstract focuses on mobile networks, it quickly shifts to discuss various technologies for mobile data offloading (Small Cell Networks, Wi-Fi offloading, D2D offloading, and VANETs), which are also relevant to wireless mesh networks and IoT.\n3. The mention of device-to-device communication and vehicular ad-hoc networks, which are also present in wireless mesh networks and IoT, adds further relevance.\n\nHowever, there is a notable difference between the context of this abstract (mobile networks) and the scoping review (wireless mesh networks, IoT, autonomous robots, etc.).
