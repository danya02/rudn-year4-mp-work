However, the abstract does mention \"ROADM\" (Reconfigurable Optical Distributed Multiplexer), which is a key technology used in traditional wired optical networks that might be related to WMNs' routing protocols, fault tolerance, and network topology.\n\nThe abstract focuses on the design and structure of optical network architectures, specifically ROADM implementations for efficient capacity expansion. While this is not directly related to WMNs, it could potentially provide insights into the scalability and efficiency of network designs that might be relevant to WMNs in general.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I notice that the key concepts in the abstract (e.g., optical networks, ROADM, EONs) are more closely related to traditional wired networking than WMNs.
