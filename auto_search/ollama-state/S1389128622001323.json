Security services: The research paper focuses on deploying security services at the edge, which is a relevant aspect of IoT and industrial applications where security is crucial.\n3.

While there is an overlap between WMNs and Edge Computing, the primary focus of this abstract is on Edge Computing, not Wireless Mesh Networks specifically.\n\n2. **Context**: The scoping review excludes emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure, which are not present in this abstract.
