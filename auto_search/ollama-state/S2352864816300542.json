The topic of FSO networks is not explicitly excluded from the review, and the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications could potentially include wireless mesh networks that utilize optical channels.\n2. While the focus on physical layer problems in previous research may seem unrelated at first glance, some of the techniques developed for improving reliability and availability in FSO networks (such as signal processing and error correction) might be relevant to routing protocols in wireless mesh networks with changing or unknown topology.\n3. The discussion of global FSO networks, their subnetworks, and state-of-the-art research suggests a comprehensive exploration of the topic that could be relevant to the broader context of wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the primary focus of this abstract seems to be on the potential and challenges of FSO networks as a whole, rather than specifically on routing protocols or the applications mentioned in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots, industrial applications).\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15710719212, "load_duration": 17241888, "prompt_eval_count": 315, "prompt_eval_duration": 69000000, "eval_count": 232, "eval_duration": 15622000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T23:48:58.907778588Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided abstract, I would say that \"In conclusion, the answer is no\".\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.
