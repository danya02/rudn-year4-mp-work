The topic of FSO networks is not explicitly excluded from the review, and the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications could potentially include wireless mesh networks that utilize optical channels.\n2. While the focus on physical layer problems in previous research may seem unrelated at first glance, some of the techniques developed for improving reliability and availability in FSO networks (such as signal processing and error correction) might be relevant to routing protocols in wireless mesh networks with changing or unknown topology.\n3. The discussion of global FSO networks, their subnetworks, and state-of-the-art research suggests a comprehensive exploration of the topic that could be relevant to the broader context of wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the primary focus of this abstract seems to be on the potential and challenges of FSO networks as a whole, rather than specifically on routing protocols or the applications mentioned in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots, industrial applications).\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15710719212, "load_duration": 17241888, "prompt_eval_count": 315, "prompt_eval_duration": 69000000, "eval_count": 232, "eval_duration": 15622000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T23:48:58.907778588Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided abstract, I would say that \"In conclusion, the answer is no\".\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The focus of the scoping review is on Wireless Mesh Networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT networks, while the abstract discusses Free Space Optical (FSO) networks.\n2. The context of the scoping review is IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications, whereas FSO networks are mentioned in a broader range of potential applications, including home and satellite communications.\n3. Although FSO networks share some similarities with wireless mesh networks in terms of emerging as viable candidates for broadband wireless communications, their focus on upper-layer issues such as network protocols, routing, and reliability does not align with the scoping review's focus on lower-layer techniques like multipath routing.\n\nOverall, while there may be some overlap between FSO networks and wireless mesh networks, the abstract appears to be more focused on a different aspect of wireless networking (upper layers vs. lower layers) that is outside the scope of the current review."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14151021770, "load_duration": 16810840, "prompt_eval_count": 315, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 210, "eval_duration": 14065000000, "verdict": false}], "verdict": null}
