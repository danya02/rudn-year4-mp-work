The Population: The review focuses on Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks. This abstract specifically discusses Wi-SUN FAN networks, which are a type of wireless mesh network used in Smart Grids and Smart Cities applications. Therefore, the Population seems relevant.\n2. Context: The review excludes certain contexts such as emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure. However, this abstract does discuss IoT technologies and their application in Smart Grids and Smart Cities, which are within the scope of the review.\n3. Concept: The review focuses on Routing protocols, dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and techniques for improving throughput (except multipath routing).
