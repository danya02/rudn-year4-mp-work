While the primary focus of the scoping review is on routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and techniques like multipath routing, the concept of CC can be seen as a related area of research. CC exploits spatial diversity to improve connectivity, which can be considered analogous to some aspects of multipath routing in terms of using multiple paths to increase overall network reliability.\n\nHowever, the specific application of CC with topology control in this abstract is more closely related to improving connectivity than traditional fault-tolerant routing protocols, as it focuses on increasing connectivity rather than directly addressing issues like node failures or network partitions.
