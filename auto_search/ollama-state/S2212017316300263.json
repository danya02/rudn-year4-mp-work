Although it does not explicitly mention routing protocols, the context of transmitting data between nodes suggests that the authors may have employed some form of routing protocol to manage the communication. The abstract also touches upon the need for fault tolerance in the system, as it mentions monitoring and recording received data.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on wireless mesh networking (hopping method) aligns with the excluded topics mentioned in the scoping review, which include techniques like multipath routing but not ad-hoc networks per se.
