The use of epipolar line search and masked representation learning suggests a focus on handling changing and unknown network topologies.\n2. **Fault tolerance**: The proposed method uses a correlation computation approach to mitigate the impacts of erroneous rectification, indicating an interest in developing fault-tolerant solutions for networks with uncertain or incorrect configurations.\n3. **IoT and industrial applications**: Although not explicitly stated, satellite images are used in remote sensing applications, which can be related to IoT and industrial settings (e.g., monitoring infrastructure or environmental conditions).\n4. **Routing protocols**: The authors discuss the use of a cascaded recurrent module for stereo matching, which involves searching for results on epipolar lines and adjacent areas.
