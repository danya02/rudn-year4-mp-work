The key challenges addressed in this study are dynamic network conditions, route discovery, and maintenance algorithms under user mobility and node joining/leaving. Although the abstract is not directly related to Wireless Mesh Networks specifically, it touches on some relevant topics such as routing protocols, fault tolerance, and topology stabilization.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misalignment with the scoping review's excluded categories, which include emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure. The abstract appears to focus on more general concepts of routing and network topology in wireless mesh networks.\n\nReasoning continues: \n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to geo-like routing that does not rely on external positioning information, instead using beacons exchanged among two-hop neighbors to approximate physical node coordinates. This method aims to reduce the communication overhead associated with route discovery and maintenance algorithms. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm suggests that it can efficiently supplement traditional on-demand routing in small to mid-size mesh networks.\n\nConsidering these aspects, while there is some overlap between the study's focus areas and the scoping review's scope, there appears to be a significant enough divergence that the abstract may not be directly relevant to the scoping review.
