This is a specific type of network that excludes ad-hoc and IoT networks, which are the main focus of the scoping review.\n2. **Routing protocols**: The abstract proposes an algorithm for constructing a virtual coordinate system used for geo-like routing, which involves route discovery and maintenance algorithms. While this is related to routing protocols, it seems more focused on geographic routing rather than traditional mesh network routing protocols like those discussed in the scoping review.\n3. **Context**: The abstract mentions user mobility, nodes joining and leaving the network, and topology stabilization, which are all relevant topics in the context of IoT, autonomous robots, or similar industrial applications (excluding emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure).\n4. **Key concepts**: The abstract discusses the challenges of high communication overhead in route discovery and maintenance algorithms, which is a common issue in mesh network routing protocols.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that this abstract is not entirely relevant to the scoping review, as it focuses on mobile handheld devices rather than ad-hoc or IoT networks. However, some of the topics discussed, such as topology stabilization and the challenges of high communication overhead in route discovery and maintenance algorithms, do intersect with the scoping review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **no**."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 24035358038, "load_duration": 19583029, "prompt_eval_count": 429, "prompt_eval_duration": 123000000, "eval_count": 304, "eval_duration": 23889000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T19:57:38.661473563Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it discusses routing protocols, specifically geo-like routing, in the context of wireless mesh networks. The focus is on improving route discovery and maintenance algorithms, particularly under dynamic network conditions caused by user mobility and nodes joining and leaving the network. While the paper focuses on mobile handheld devices and doesn't explicitly mention IoT or autonomous robots, its discussion of node mobility and path establishment aligns with the review's context.\n\nHowever, there is a slight deviation in the scope: the abstract primarily deals with geographic routing protocols that rely on external positioning information, whereas the scoping review seems to focus on traditional mesh networks, fault tolerance, and routing protocols for changing network topology. Nonetheless, the paper's exploration of alternative routing mechanisms, like gradient-assisted routing (GAR), makes it relevant to the broader topic of routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14362966569, "load_duration": 19136311, "prompt_eval_count": 429, "prompt_eval_duration": 73000000, "eval_count": 186, "eval_duration": 14267000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T19:57:57.819810981Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThis abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review as it deals with Wireless Mesh Networks, specifically ad-hoc networks, which is one of the populations mentioned in the review. The context mentioned in the review (IoT, autonomous robots) can also be linked to this abstract, as wireless mesh networks are often used in IoT applications.\n\nThe concept discussed in this abstract (routing protocols) falls within the scope of the review, particularly dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and routing protocols. The focus on dynamic network conditions caused by user mobility and nodes joining and leaving the network is also relevant to the concepts explored in the scoping review.\n\nOne potential exclusion criterion mentioned in the review is \"Emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure\", but this abstract does not explicitly mention these topics. However, it can be inferred that the proposed algorithm may have broader applicability beyond small-scale IoT applications, which could include other domains such as autonomous robots or industrial automation.\n\nOverall, while there might be some nuances to consider, this abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review based on its focus on Wireless Mesh Networks and routing protocols in a dynamic environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 19156770360, "load_duration": 17849436, "prompt_eval_count": 429, "prompt_eval_duration": 77000000, "eval_count": 247, "eval_duration": 19059000000, "verdict": true}], "verdict": true}
