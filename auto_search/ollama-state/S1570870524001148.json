The population of interest (Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT) is present in the abstract.\n2. Although the context (IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications) is slightly broader than the scope of the scoping review, it does overlap with some of the excluded contexts mentioned in the original prompt (e.g., emergency response networks are not explicitly mentioned, but IoT and industrial applications could be related to wireless mesh networks).\n3. The abstract discusses routing protocols, specifically channel allocation and network layout optimization, which is relevant to the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance.\n4. However, it also mentions techniques for improving throughput (multipath routing), which are excluded from the scoping review.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are some overlaps between the abstract and the scope of the scoping review, the mention of techniques like multipath routing and the focus on Wi-Fi 6E devices rather than wireless mesh networks or IoT specifically might make it slightly less relevant.
