The Context specifically excludes emergency response networks, military operations, urban infrastructure, and focuses on IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications.\n\nIn contrast, the abstract discusses Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) which are a type of mobile ad-hoc network, used for communication in vehicles. While VANETs do share some similarities with traditional ad-hoc networks, they are specifically designed for vehicular communication and may not be directly applicable to the IoT and industrial applications targeted by the scoping review.\n\nFurthermore, the abstract focuses on VoIP performance using OLSR routing protocol, which is a routing protocol used in general-purpose ad-hoc networks. The techniques discussed (multipath routing, Quality of Service) are also specific to general-purpose networks rather than those targeting IoT or industrial automation applications.\n\nTherefore, while there may be some tangential connections between the research and the scoping review's Population and Context, I believe that this abstract is not directly relevant to the scope of the review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 24668455842, "load_duration": 17090629, "prompt_eval_count": 398, "prompt_eval_duration": 6798000000, "eval_count": 261, "eval_duration": 17850000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:27:13.128618415Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThis abstract appears relevant to the scoping review because it deals with Wireless Mesh Networks, specifically Ad-hoc networks, and focuses on Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as end-to-end delay, jitter, and packet loss.
