The focus on wireless mesh networks, ad-hoc networks, and IoT suggests that the topic is related to network topology and structure, which is a key aspect of routing protocols.\n2. The mention of fault tolerance implies consideration of how networks can adapt to changes or failures, which is an important concept in the context of emergency response networks and industrial applications excluded from the review.\n3. While the abstract does not explicitly mention routing protocols, the discussion of combinatorial properties, including randomized routing, hints at connections to network design and optimization techniques that might be relevant to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, without more information on how the concepts discussed in this abstract relate to ad-hoc networks or IoT, it's difficult to determine its full relevance.
