Distributed computing: The algorithm distributes computation load to each node, which is a technique used in some WMNs and IoT applications.\n2. Fault tolerance: The algorithm constructs an active vibration control network topology by discarding weak coupling secondary paths between nodes, which might be similar to techniques used in fault-tolerant WMNs or IoT networks.\n\nHowever, the abstract does not explicitly discuss these aspects in the context of WMNs or IoT applications, but rather focuses on the application and performance of the algorithm in helicopter control.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no. The abstract primarily discusses an application of a distributed algorithm to helicopter control, which seems unrelated to Wireless Mesh Networks and IoT applications at first glance.
