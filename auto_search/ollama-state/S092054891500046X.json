The context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications also aligns with the scope of the review. The concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput through techniques like multipath routing are not explicitly covered in this abstract, but the discussion on hidden and exposed terminal problems in WMSNs is related to these concepts.\n\nHowever, the specific focus on hidden and exposed effects in WMSNs, particularly those using the IEEE 802.15.5 LR-WPAN standard, might be considered more relevant than other general routing protocols. Additionally, the evaluation of performance impact and proposed mitigation strategies for these problems could provide valuable insights into improving the resilience and efficiency of WMSNs.\n\nOverall, while this abstract does not directly focus on routing protocols or the aspects explicitly mentioned in the scoping review (routing protocols dealing with changing network topology), it does address a relevant population (WMSNs) within the specified context.
