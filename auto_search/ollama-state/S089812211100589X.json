The Population scope of the scoping review is specifically focused on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n2. While MANETs are a type of wireless network, they differ from WMNs in that they consist of mobile terminals and do not have a fixed infrastructure.\n3.

The Concept focus of the abstract is on routing protocols, particularly OLSR and BATMAN, which deals with changing network topology and fault tolerance. However, this aspect also overlaps with the techniques for improving throughput excluded from the scoping review.\n\nConsidering these points, I conclude that the abstract is not directly relevant to the scoping review's focus on WMNs, IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications, as it involves a different type of network (MANET), indoor environment, and does not align with the excluded contexts or specific routing protocol techniques."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15961232615, "load_duration": 16548343, "prompt_eval_count": 326, "prompt_eval_duration": 66000000, "eval_count": 236, "eval_duration": 15876000000, "verdict": null}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:54:32.874848885Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n- The abstract primarily discusses Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), which is outside the scope of the scoping review focused on Wireless Mesh Networks.\n- The discussion revolves around routing protocols and network performance in a specific context, but the key aspect being evaluated - OLSR and BATMAN - is not within the included concepts of Routing protocols for changing/unknown topology, fault tolerance, or improving throughput like multipath routing.
