The focus is on reducing the number of hops in point-to-point communications between adjacent grid regions. While the topic involves routing protocols, it's more specific to a particular application (global atmospheric model) and technology (K computer). The scoping review aims to examine techniques for improving throughput in wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, which is different from the 3D torus network topology mentioned.\n\nThe only potential connection between this abstract and the scoping review's scope is the mention of \"network topology\" and \"routing protocols\", but the context of the two topics seems quite distinct.

Although the main focus is not explicitly on wireless mesh networks or IoT, which are the target populations of this scoping review, the context is similar (autonomous robots, industrial applications). The algorithm's ability to improve weak scaling and reduce congestion could be relevant to other network topologies and use cases in IoT and autonomous systems.
