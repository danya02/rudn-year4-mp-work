It deals with the performance analysis of this technique specifically in the context of two-way relay channels, which can be seen as a type of mesh network topology.\n\nThe topics mentioned in the abstract, such as symbol error rate (SER), diversity order, and performance enhancement through minimized SER relay selection, align closely with the concepts explored in the scoping review.
