The abstract mentions two models (H* and F*) that describe the characteristics of the network edges, which is similar to the context excluded by the scoping review (i.e., mobile phones are excluded). However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the abstract is not about routing protocols in the sense of fault tolerance or multipath routing, but rather a gossiping problem.
