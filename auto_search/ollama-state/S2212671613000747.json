The context mentioned in the scoping review includes industrial applications such as autonomous robots and IoT, which aligns with the focus of this abstract.\n\nThe abstract discusses routing protocols, including AODV (Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) and DSR (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector), which are both relevant to ad-hoc networks. The inclusion of fuzzy inference system suggests that the research focuses on improving routing decision-making by considering multiple constraints, such as link failure or congestion.\n\nThe abstract's emphasis on analyzing the performance of these protocols with and without the fuzzy inference system aligns with the goal of evaluating various techniques for enhancing fault tolerance in ad-hoc networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15552923680, "load_duration": 17505439, "prompt_eval_count": 304, "prompt_eval_duration": 4163000000, "eval_count": 171, "eval_duration": 11370000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:46:41.215326474Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can provide my reasoning for this abstract to determine its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nThe abstract appears relevant to the scoping review because it:\n\n1.

The topic is routing protocols, which aligns with the Concept of the scoping review.\n2. The focus is on improving routing decision-making by considering multiple constraints (e.g., dropping header packets in case of congestion or alternate paths in case of link failure), which relates to the Context of IoT and autonomous robots where network topology changes are common.\n3. The abstract mentions AODV and DSR routing protocols, which are specifically mentioned as excluded in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, it also introduces a new concept: Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). While FIS is not explicitly mentioned in the initial exclusion criteria, its application to improve routing decision-making by considering uncertain and imprecise constraints might be relevant to the broader topic of routing protocols in IoT and autonomous robots.\n\nReasoning: The abstract's relevance is conditional on whether the Fuzzy Inference System aspect is considered a secondary or supplementary technology rather than a fundamental aspect of the scoping review. If it's seen as an additional technique that can be applied to improve routing protocols, then it might be relevant. However, if it's viewed as a separate topic that expands upon the main focus on routing protocols, it might not be directly relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18572105267, "load_duration": 16950685, "prompt_eval_count": 304, "prompt_eval_duration": 65000000, "eval_count": 275, "eval_duration": 18487000000, "verdict": true}], "verdict": true}
