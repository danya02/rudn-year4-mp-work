Although the topic seems unrelated at first glance, I noticed that the review's context includes IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications where wireless mesh networks are often used. The study on terpene synthases might not seem directly related to these topics, but the abstract mentions protein engineering, which could be applicable to developing novel biomaterials or sensing technologies for IoT applications.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract touches upon the concept of \"catalytic promiscuity,\" which is also relevant to routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.
