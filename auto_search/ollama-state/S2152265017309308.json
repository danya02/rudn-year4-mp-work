The focus on treatment efficacy and comparison between different treatments may seem unrelated to WMNs. However, I notice that the abstract mentions \"regimens\" in the context of treatment options for patients, which could be loosely related to network configurations or protocols used in WMNs.\n\nMoreover, the mention of \"treatment history,\" a crucial factor when evaluating subsequent treatment options, might imply considerations similar to those in WMN design and optimization, where understanding the current state ( topology, traffic patterns, etc.) is essential for making informed decisions about future configurations or upgrades.\n\nGiven these potential connections, it seems possible that some aspects of network optimization or decision-making in WMNs might be analogous to the considerations mentioned in this abstract.
