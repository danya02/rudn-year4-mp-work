Although the topic of network security is relevant, it doesn't align with the specific focus on WMNs.\n\n2. **Relevance to Context**: The context of this scoping review is IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications, specifically focusing on emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure being excluded.
