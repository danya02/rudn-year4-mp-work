The research focuses on evaluating the simulated behavior of MANET for NCS, which aligns with the context of IoT and autonomous robots. Additionally, the abstract mentions the benefits of wireless technology, such as reduced installation costs and scalability, which is related to the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems that the primary focus is on evaluating the performance of AODV in a MANET for NCS, rather than discussing routing protocols specifically.
