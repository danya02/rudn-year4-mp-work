However, the key point here is whether the abstract discusses \"routing protocols\" dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the abstract does not explicitly discuss routing protocols in this sense. Instead, it compares two name resolution and routing schemes (flooding and DHT) and evaluates their characteristics and performance. While name resolution is indeed a critical component of these schemes, the focus is more on the design tradeoffs and performance evaluation rather than fault tolerance or changing network topology.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the abstract does touch upon fault tolerance in the sense that it mentions \"content location dynamics\" and how they affect the performance of different approaches.
