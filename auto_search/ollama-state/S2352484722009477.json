Although wireless power transfer (WPT) systems may seem unrelated at first glance, it's essential to note that some of the techniques and concepts discussed in this abstract, such as resonance compensation circuits, frequency bifurcation, and numerical analysis methods, could potentially be applied or used in conjunction with routing protocols in IoT networks.\n\nFor instance, understanding how IPT systems behave under different conditions (e.g., over-coupled states) might provide insights into how to optimize network topologies or routing strategies for IoT devices.
