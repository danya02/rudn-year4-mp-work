But since it's a specific example of routing protocol, it might still be considered relevant.\n* The paper does not discuss techniques for improving throughput (multipath routing) or fault tolerance, but rather focuses on coding gain and packet delivery ratio, which could indirectly benefit from these aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14911446099, "load_duration": 19323023, "prompt_eval_count": 220, "prompt_eval_duration": 2384000000, "eval_count": 172, "eval_duration": 12506000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:18:42.23742588Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This paper appears to be relevant to the scoping review as it deals with routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT networks, which are within the scope of the review. The focus on multicast routing, network coding, and comparison with other existing protocols (ODMRP and MORE-M) also aligns with the concepts discussed in the review.\n\nReasoning: \n\n- The paper discusses a practical multicast routing algorithm that transforms a conventional multicast tree into a mesh, which is relevant to the routing protocols for wireless mesh networks.\n- The use of network coding scheme and comparison with other existing protocols further supports its relevance to the scoping review.\n- The context mentioned in the abstract (IoT, autonomous robots) seems to be related to the industry applications mentioned in the review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 12562734383, "load_duration": 19341544, "prompt_eval_count": 220, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 167, "eval_duration": 12474000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:18:57.615256994Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll break down my reasoning into two parts:\n\n**Relevance to scoping review:**\n\n* The topic of wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT, is relevant to the scoping review.\n* Multicast routing protocols are discussed, which deals with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance. This is a key concept in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances:\n* The focus on double direction network coding scheme may not directly relate to improving throughput (multipath routing) specifically mentioned as excluded techniques.\n* The comparison with ODMRP and MORE-M might be more relevant to the topic of multicast routing protocols, but it is still within the scope of the scoping review.\n\n**Reasoning for relevance:**\n\nGiven the overlap in concepts (multicast routing, network topology, fault tolerance), I believe this abstract is relevant to the scoping review.
