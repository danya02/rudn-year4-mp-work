The main focus of this abstract is the comparison of different airway devices used for awake tracheal intubation in adult patients, which seems unrelated to wireless mesh networks at first glance.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, one might consider the following aspects as potentially relevant:\n\n1. The use of various devices with changing and unknown network topology (in this case, airway devices during tracheal intubation) might be analogous to the complexities encountered in wireless mesh networks.\n2. Fault tolerance is another concept that could be applied to both airway devices and wireless mesh networks. For instance, in wireless mesh networks, fault-tolerant routing protocols are crucial for maintaining network connectivity in case of node failures or link disruptions. Similarly, in airway management, having a reliable and robust device like an optical stylet might be comparable to having a fault-tolerant wireless mesh network.\n3.
