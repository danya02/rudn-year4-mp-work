The techniques used in this paper, such as shortest path algorithms and adaptive re-routing strategies, are more applicable to traditional computer networking concepts rather than the specific context of wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some of the principles discussed in this abstract, such as dealing with dynamic congestion patterns and implementing adaptive re-routing strategies, might be relevant to certain aspects of wireless mesh network routing protocols.
