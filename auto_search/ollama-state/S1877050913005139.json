Although it does not explicitly mention wireless mesh networks or routing protocols, I notice that:\n\n1. The use of Doppler radar data implies a need for efficient and reliable data transmission and reception.\n2. The hierarchical guidance and control framework with algorithms that can adapt to environmental, sensing, and computational resources might involve advanced networking and communication techniques, potentially including those used in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, the focus on airborne applications, wind sensing capabilities, and atmospheric modeling suggests a narrower scope than the scoping review's emphasis on IoT, autonomous robots, industrial applications, and routing protocols dealing with changing network topology and fault tolerance.\n\nReasoning:\n\nGiven the specific focus of this abstract on airborne applications and atmospheric modeling, I believe that it is not directly relevant to the scoping review.
