However, this abstract seems more focused on the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) used in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), which may not directly relate to the main areas of interest.\n\nAlthough LLNs are a type of wireless network that could be relevant to the scoping review, the primary focus of this abstract is on the NDP protocol itself, its optimization, and its implementation in a specific context. The discussion of complexities, adoption rates, and simulation results may provide some general insights into the challenges faced by wireless networks in IoT applications.\n\nTo determine relevance, I would ask whether the research on LLNs and NDP protocols can contribute to understanding the performance and limitations of Wireless Mesh Networks in IoT scenarios.
