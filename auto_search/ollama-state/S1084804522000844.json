The context mentioned in the abstract (\"IoT\", \"autonomous robots\") aligns with the excluded contexts mentioned in the scoping review (emergency response networks, military operations, urban infrastructure).\n2. However, it's worth noting that the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and swarms in this abstract does bring up interesting topics related to wireless mesh networks, ad-hoc networks, and mobile networks.\n3.

Although it focuses on FANETs using UAVs, the concepts of mobility control, topology adaptation, and routing protocols are common themes in wireless mesh networks.

The context is IoT, which is mentioned in the scoping review. Aerial surveillance using UAVs can be considered a form of IoT application.\n2.
