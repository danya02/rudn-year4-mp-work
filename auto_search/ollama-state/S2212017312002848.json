Therefore, it is relevant to the scoping review.\n2. **Focus on Routing Protocols**: Although not explicitly stated, routing protocols (specifically multicast routing) are central to the paper's discussion. Since the scoping review focuses on routing protocols for ad-hoc and IoT networks with changing topology, this aspect is also relevant.\n3. **Context of Industrial Applications**: The abstract mentions applications in IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial settings, which aligns with the exclusion criteria mentioned earlier (IoT, autonomous robots).\n4. **Exclusion of Emergency Response Networks and Military Operations**: There is no mention of emergency response networks or military operations in the abstract, so it does not violate this criterion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, the answer is **yes**.
