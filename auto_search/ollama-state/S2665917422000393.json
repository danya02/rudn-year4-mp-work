While the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications may seem distant from wireless mesh networks, there are some common themes that could be relevant to the scoping review:\n\n1. Wireless sensor networks: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of sensors in a networked system suggests the possibility of wireless communication between sensors.\n2. Industrial applications: The context of pipeline systems and leak detection could overlap with industrial automation and control systems, which may intersect with the broader field of wireless mesh networks.\n3.
