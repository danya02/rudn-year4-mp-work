Evaluating the feasibility of integrating actuators, sensors, and digital twins with the fa\u00e7ade's control systems.\n\nWhile there might be some indirect benefits to such a system in terms of fault tolerance or flexibility (e.g., being able to adjust shading or ventilation based on external factors), this study does not explicitly address routing protocols, changing network topology, or other concepts directly related to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, I also notice that the abstract mentions the \"decentral organisation\" of fa\u00e7ade functions, which could potentially be seen as a way to create resilient networks.
