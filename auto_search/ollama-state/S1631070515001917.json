This topic is relevant to wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, as these networks often involve communication between devices or nodes in close proximity to each other.\n\nIn the context of this scoping review, which focuses on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and throughput improvement techniques, understanding antenna radiation and wave propagation is crucial for optimizing network performance. The abstract's discussion of Green's functions associated with penetrable cylinders, current sheets, and creeping waves may be tangentially related to these topics.\n\nHowever, the primary focus of the abstract appears to be on developing a better understanding of antenna behavior in relation to human bodies, rather than directly addressing routing protocols or wireless mesh network performance.
