The context of the paper appears to be relevant to the scoping review, which focuses on IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications. Although the primary limitations of FANET are discussed in the abstract, they seem to be related to communication and navigation within the swarm, which is also relevant to the scoping review.\n\nThe key concept presented in the paper, the use of a modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for determining UAV flight trajectories, may have implications for routing protocols in wireless mesh networks, particularly those dealing with changing and unknown network topology. The abstract does not explicitly mention routing protocols, but the proposed algorithm may be relevant to improving fault tolerance and throughput in such networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I would argue that the paper's focus on UAV swarms and FANET is more prominent than its discussion of wireless mesh networks or routing protocols per se.
