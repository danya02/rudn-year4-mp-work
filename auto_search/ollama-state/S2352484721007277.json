IoT applications: Smart power grids involve various IoT devices, including smart meters, which rely on secure communication protocols.\n2.

The focus on wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT, is not explicitly mentioned in this abstract, but the context of industrial applications (such as autonomous robots) and smart grids suggests that the topic may be relevant.\n2. The concept of routing protocols is not directly addressed in this abstract, but the discussion of two-way authentication between smart meters and electricity company servers implies a level of network communication that could be related to routing protocols.\n3. The emphasis on fault tolerance, security, and authentication mechanisms (such as elliptic curve cryptography) aligns with some of the key concepts discussed in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, there are also some indications that this abstract may not be entirely relevant:\n\n1. The focus on cyber-security threats and attacks on smart grids suggests a more general interest in network security rather than specifically routing protocols or wireless mesh networks.\n2. The absence of specific references to ad-hoc networking or IoT in the context of industrial applications implies that the article may not directly contribute to the scoping review's goals.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes (with some caveats). While this abstract does touch on some relevant concepts and themes, it appears to be more focused on general network security and cyber-security issues rather than specifically addressing routing protocols or wireless mesh networks.
