These aspects are relevant to the scoping review's focus on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and IoT, as they aim to improve QoS and network performance in complex networks with dynamic topologies.\n\nThe proposed MLPRS scheme addresses some of the same challenges as routing protocols in WMNs and IoT networks, such as:\n\n* Dynamic re-routing to avoid congestion\n* Real-time load balancing and adjustment\n* Improvement of QoS and network performance\n\nHowever, the primary focus on SDNs using machine learning algorithms might be seen as somewhat divergent from the specific context of Wireless Mesh Networks and IoT.
