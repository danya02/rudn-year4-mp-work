The context of IoT and autonomous robots does not appear directly, but the discussion on segment/OLT level failure could be related to the handling of changing and unknown network topology in IoT applications. Additionally, the focus on fault tolerance and survivability is also relevant to the review's concept.\n\nHowever, the specific algorithm proposed (fully mesh based protection scheme) and its application to handling segment level failures might not be directly related to routing protocols or improving throughput, which are the excluded concepts. Nevertheless, the emphasis on survivability and reducing blocking probability in the network could be seen as indirectly relevant due to the shared interest in ensuring reliable communication in IoT applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14823953307, "load_duration": 16481174, "prompt_eval_count": 271, "prompt_eval_duration": 3380000000, "eval_count": 170, "eval_duration": 11425000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T22:43:29.394562394Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review the abstract to determine its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nThe abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review, as it:\n\n* Focuses on wireless mesh networks, which is one of the populations included in the review.\n* Discusses FiWi (Fixed Wireless Internet) networks, which are also within the scope of the review.\n* Addresses routing protocols and network topology, specifically segment level failure and proposed solutions to handle it, aligning with the concept of interest.\n* Excludes emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure, which is consistent with the excluded contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 8707924040, "load_duration": 17335580, "prompt_eval_count": 271, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 129, "eval_duration": 8620000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T22:43:44.858823132Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine if this abstract is relevant to the scoping review, I will analyze it as follows:\n\n* The Population (Wireless Mesh Networks) seems to be excluded from the scope of this scoping review.\n* The Context (IoT, autonomous robots and similar industrial applications) may not directly relate to FiWi networks or routing protocols in general.\n* Although routing protocols are mentioned indirectly through the discussion on network survivability, the focus is more on network design and failure handling rather than specific routing protocols for unknown/ changing topology.\n* The technique being proposed (Fully Mesh based protection scheme) is indeed related to fault tolerance and improving network reliability.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that this abstract does touch on aspects of routing or network topology management (fully mesh fashion), even if it's more focused on network design and failure handling.
