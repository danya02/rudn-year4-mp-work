While there may be some indirect relevance due to the increasing use of renewable energy resources in IoT applications, the focus on OPF and HDNs appears unrelated to the primary concepts and themes discussed in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract does mention the need for robustness and efficiency in solving OPF problems, which could be analogous to the fault tolerance and throughput issues often encountered in wireless mesh networks.
