Although the specific context of the scoping review is IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications with emergency response networks or military operations being excluded, the security scheme proposed in this abstract can be relevant to these contexts as well.\n\nThe proposal of LEAS (Localized Efficient Authentication Scheme) under a broker-based hierarchical security architecture and trust model addresses routing protocols' concerns, such as fault tolerance and changing network topology. The focus on mutual authentication, key agreement, and resistance to various attacks makes it relevant to the concept of routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, considering the explicit exclusion of emergency response networks, military operations, and urban infrastructure in the scoping review context, one might argue that this abstract is not directly relevant. Nevertheless, the proposal's focus on security, authentication, and key agreement makes it a valuable contribution to the broader topic of routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15472106732, "load_duration": 16985915, "prompt_eval_count": 281, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 230, "eval_duration": 15386000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:00:54.788126455Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it focuses on wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with a specific emphasis on:\n\n1.
