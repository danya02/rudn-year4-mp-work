The abstract mentions a \"two-dimensional mesh\", which can be considered a type of WMN.\n2. **Context**: The abstract is related to Industrial Automation and IoT, which falls within the excluded context. However, it does mention autonomous robots and similar industrial applications, which might still be tangentially relevant.\n3. **Concept**: The review focuses on Routing protocols, dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and routing techniques. The abstract discusses a \"broadcast spanning tree\" and a \"virtual source broadcast algorithm\", both of which are related to routing and fault tolerance.\n\nGiven that the abstract deals with routing protocols, fault tolerance, and broadcasting algorithms in a WMN context, it appears relevant to the scoping review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **yes**."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17569559197, "load_duration": 17572070, "prompt_eval_count": 299, "prompt_eval_duration": 4045000000, "eval_count": 202, "eval_duration": 13505000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:35:39.238111655Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\nThe abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it focuses on fault-tolerant routing protocols, specifically a broadcast algorithm designed for wormhole routed two-dimensional meshes.
