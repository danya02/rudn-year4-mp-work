The proposed system, called SOMA, utilizes a hybrid Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) build on top of Chord, allowing each node to define its own trust policy while maintaining autonomy.\n\nThis abstract appears relevant to the scoping review for several reasons:\n\n1. **Relevance to IoT and mesh networks**: The focus on wireless mesh networks, specifically in the context of IoT and industrial applications, aligns with the scope of the review.\n2. **Routing protocols and fault tolerance are not the primary concern**: Although the abstract does not explicitly address routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput, it is primarily focused on security and authentication mechanisms that can be applied to mesh networks without disrupting their autonomous characteristics.\n3. **No direct relevance to emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure**: The abstract's focus on mesh networks in general and IoT applications makes it less directly relevant to these specific contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20488686604, "load_duration": 16958277, "prompt_eval_count": 366, "prompt_eval_duration": 5870000000, "eval_count": 216, "eval_duration": 14599000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T23:27:53.343326185Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT.
