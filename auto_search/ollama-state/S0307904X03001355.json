But since wormholes can be a special case of a more general routing problem, it might still be tangentially related.\n\nAdditionally, the main concern of the abstract is the development of an analytical model for message latency in binary cubes with virtual channels, which could have broader implications for wireless mesh networks, even if not directly stated.
