The main issue here is the limited network lifetime, which can disrupt the operation of WBANs.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I notice that the context mentioned in the scoping review excludes applications such as IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial settings. In contrast, this abstract appears to be focused on Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), which is not explicitly excluded from the scope.\n\nFurthermore, the technique discussed in the abstract, a three-stage cooperative relaying scheme, can potentially improve routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, or other relevant aspects of wireless mesh networks. Although it's primarily focused on energy efficiency and reliability for WBANs, its applicability to related areas like mesh networks is possible.\n\nGiven these observations, I would say that \"In conclusion, the answer is yes\".
