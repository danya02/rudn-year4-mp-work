The mention of laboratory experiments on small/medium-size networks also aligns with the focus on ad-hoc networks.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some details about the specific context are missing, such as the mention of autonomous robots and industrial applications, which might be crucial for determining the exact relevance to the scoping review.
