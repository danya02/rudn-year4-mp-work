Although the primary focus seems to be on human transportation modes using mobile phone data and global positioning system (GPS) communication, the analysis of traffic behavior and pedestrian activity during different times of the day, including hot weather conditions, might provide insights into how networks can handle varying network topologies, fault tolerance, and potentially even adapt to environmental changes.\n\nFurthermore, some aspects of the study could be related to routing protocols that deal with changing and unknown network topology.
