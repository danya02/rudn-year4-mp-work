The review excludes networks like those using mobile phones, emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure.\n\nWhile DTs can be applied in various industries, the specific focus on bridge O&M and its unique challenges (e.g., data synchronization, fault tolerance) is not relevant to the scoping review's focus on Wireless Mesh Networks.
