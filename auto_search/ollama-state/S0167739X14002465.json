These proposals are specifically designed for ASES mode and aim to alleviate the HT problem.

The Population: The abstract mentions Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs), which falls within the specified population of ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n2. Context: Although the context mentioned in the scoping review is specific to IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications, the abstract's focus on wireless mesh sensor networks could still be relevant to these contexts.\n3. Concept: The concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput are not directly addressed in this abstract. However, the discussion about hidden terminals, which degrades network performance, is related to routing protocol issues.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that this abstract is somewhat relevant to the scoping review, as it discusses Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) and their specific challenges, particularly those related to hidden terminals."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 13241618076, "load_duration": 16901028, "prompt_eval_count": 663, "prompt_eval_duration": 69000000, "eval_count": 187, "eval_duration": 13152000000, "verdict": null}], "verdict": true}
