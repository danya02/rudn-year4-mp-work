The study investigates how different types and durations of obstructions affect network performance across various OSI layers. While the primary context is WiGig-based technologies for wireless backhaul scenarios, the discussion about mmWave protocols and their susceptibility to obstruction is relevant to the scoping review.\n\nThe scoping review focuses on routing protocols for Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, in the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications. The abstract discusses the performance of a mmWave-based mesh network, which is similar in scope to the scoping review's focus areas.\n\nHowever, the abstract does not directly discuss routing protocols or their impact on changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, or improving throughput (multipath routing). Instead, it focuses on the impact of obstructions on network performance. Therefore, while some aspects of the study might be relevant to the scoping review, the abstract's primary focus is different.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 26159351032, "load_duration": 16623783, "prompt_eval_count": 477, "prompt_eval_duration": 9061000000, "eval_count": 249, "eval_duration": 17079000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T01:42:20.104358873Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract discusses the limitations of millimeter-wave-based wireless protocols (IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay) due to line-of-sight requirements, which can lead to performance degradation or link failure under obstruction conditions. The article presents a dataset collected from an experimental IEEE 802.11ad backhaul network, providing insights into the behavior of mmWave networks under different scenarios.\n\nThe focus on WiGig-based technologies for wireless backhaul scenarios is relevant to the scoping review, which specifically looks at Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and IoT applications. The dataset's comprehensive measurement campaign at multiple OSI layers also aligns with the topics of fault tolerance, routing protocols, and network topology.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract primarily explores the performance degradation caused by obstructions in mmWave networks rather than traditional WMN or IoT application-focused concepts. Nevertheless, the dataset's value for understanding real-life mmWave-based WiGig networks makes it a useful resource for researchers and professionals in this field.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14935929904, "load_duration": 16795071, "prompt_eval_count": 477, "prompt_eval_duration": 66000000, "eval_count": 217, "eval_duration": 14850000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T01:42:36.788743579Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review the abstract to determine its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nThe abstract discusses wireless backhaul networks, specifically those using millimeter-wave protocols (IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay) in outdoor environments.
