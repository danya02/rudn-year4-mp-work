This scoping review seems to be primarily concerned with wireless networking aspects.\n\nHowever, the abstract discusses a specific IoT system for monitoring photovoltaic modules, which involves Wi-Fi and MQTT technologies but does not explicitly focus on wireless mesh networks or routing protocols. While it may tangentially relate to some concepts in wireless networking (e.g., MQTT), its primary scope appears to be data collection, processing, and analysis in an IoT context.\n\nThe review's exclusion criteria also exclude industrial applications like the one described in the abstract, which is focused on remote monitoring of photovoltaic modules.
