It highlights the need for edge computing technologies to address these challenges. The paper presented is a tutorial that compares three typical edge computing technologies: mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing.\n\nAlthough the paper does not explicitly mention wireless mesh networks or routing protocols, it discusses the aspects of edge computing technologies that are relevant to the context of IoT applications and industrial settings, such as decreasing latency, improving Spectral Efficiency, and supporting massive machine-type communication. These aspects can be related to the routing protocols used in wireless mesh networks.\n\nFurthermore, the paper highlights the differences between mobile edge computing and fog computing from the viewpoint of radio access network, which could be relevant to wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 16620149233, "load_duration": 16946789, "prompt_eval_count": 345, "prompt_eval_duration": 5279000000, "eval_count": 169, "eval_duration": 11321000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:27:17.018934857Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "My reasoning for determining the relevance of this abstract to the scoping review is as follows:\n\nThe abstract discusses edge computing technologies, including mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing, which are all related to distributed computing and communication systems.
