While this study focuses on materials science and nanotechnology, its relevance to the scoping review lies in the fact that it deals with wireless mesh networks (specifically ad-hoc and IoT) and industrial applications, such as autonomous robots. The study's findings may provide insights into how to optimize sensor performance for industrial applications, which could be applicable to designing more resilient and efficient wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the study is primarily focused on materials science and does not explicitly address routing protocols, fault tolerance, or any other specific concepts relevant to wireless mesh networks.
