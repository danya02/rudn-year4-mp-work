Although SD-WANs and traditional wireless mesh networks differ in their architecture, both deal with network topology changes, fault tolerance, and policy enforcement, which are key concepts in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, there is a critical difference between the two topics: the primary focus of the abstract is on SDN application in SD-WANs, whereas the scoping review focuses specifically on wireless mesh networks and IoT applications.

Additionally, the emphasis on scalability, fault tolerance, and performance in this context might align with the scoping review's requirements.\n\nGiven these connections, I would argue that while the abstract is not directly relevant, it does touch on themes related to the scoping review.
