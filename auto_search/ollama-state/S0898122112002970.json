The research focuses on data aggregation and minimizing the objective cost function in multiple dimensions.

The techniques mentioned (PSO) are more related to optimization methods rather than traditional routing protocols used in wireless mesh networks.\n\nTherefore, while some aspects of the research work might be tangentially relevant to the scoping review's focus on IoT and network-related topics, it seems that the abstract is not a direct fit for the specific scope of the review. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18775165614, "load_duration": 16684327, "prompt_eval_count": 318, "prompt_eval_duration": 4656000000, "eval_count": 210, "eval_duration": 14100000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T02:55:30.459700892Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it discusses a specific problem related to IoT systems (multi-sensor data fusion) and proposes a new optimization technique (Improved PSO) to solve it. The focus on particle swarm optimization, which is a routing protocol technique, suggests that the work may have implications for routing protocols in wireless mesh networks or other types of IoT networks.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract mentions specific aspects of IoT systems that are relevant to the scoping review, such as embedded systems, sensors, and data aggregation. While the specific application area (multi-sensor data fusion) is different from the original scope of ad-hoc and IoT networks with routing protocols, it is still within the broader context of IoT and wireless communication.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the abstract's focus on multi-sensor data fusion, optimization techniques for data aggregation, and experimental results using PSO suggests that it may be more closely related to the topic of data fusion and optimization rather than traditional routing protocols. Nevertheless, without further information or a detailed review of all relevant literature, I would still consider the abstract as potentially relevant due to its connections to IoT networks and wireless communication.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 16665796059, "load_duration": 16781980, "prompt_eval_count": 318, "prompt_eval_duration": 65000000, "eval_count": 247, "eval_duration": 16581000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T02:55:40.964564748Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This abstract appears relevant to the scoping review of Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, in the context of IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications. \n\nThe main reasons for this relevance are:\n\n1.
