The study's focus is on designing and deploying an IoT-based air quality monitoring system (AQMS) using LoRaWAN technology.\n2. Although the review focuses on Wireless Mesh Networks and ad-hoc networks, specifically in the context of IoT and autonomous robots, there is a clear application area for wireless networking (LoRaWAN) in this study that overlaps with the scope of the review.\n3. The system's components, such as sensors, Arduino microcontroller, LoRa shield, LoRaWAN gateway, and TTN platform, are also relevant to wireless mesh networks or ad-hoc networks.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe the abstract is relevant to the scoping review, albeit on the edge of relevance due to the exclusion of mobile phones.
