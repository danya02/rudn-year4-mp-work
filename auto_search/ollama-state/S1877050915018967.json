This is indeed related to the concept of routing protocols, especially those dealing with dynamic network topologies.\n\nHowever, I'll consider an additional criterion: The Concept mentions adjusting redundant fields in route request packets, which might not be directly relevant to the scoping review's focus on throughput improvement techniques (e.g., multipath routing). While this is a specific implementation detail of the LAR1 protocol, it's not necessarily related to the broader concept of improving overall network performance.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that the abstract is somewhat relevant to the scoping review.
