The use of directed graphs and algorithms for calculation also has similarities with routing protocols in wireless mesh networks, especially those dealing with changing network topology.\n\nHowever, without further context or explicit mention of wireless mesh networks or IoT, it's difficult to say whether this abstract is directly relevant to the scoping review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 13512288174, "load_duration": 16966486, "prompt_eval_count": 240, "prompt_eval_duration": 2531000000, "eval_count": 164, "eval_duration": 10962000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:43:52.112340757Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would determine that this abstract is NOT relevant to the scoping review.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The context mentioned in the scoping review excludes industrial applications such as IoT, autonomous robots, etc.\n* The topic discussed in the abstract appears to be related to electrical network analysis and optimization, specifically calculating distribution coefficients of main currents using a modified topological method.\n* There is no mention of wireless mesh networks or routing protocols, which are the primary focus of the scoping review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is NO."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 7158646018, "load_duration": 18483592, "prompt_eval_count": 240, "prompt_eval_duration": 64000000, "eval_count": 107, "eval_duration": 7074000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:44:00.560898094Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract appears to discuss a research methodology related to calculating distribution coefficients for main currents in electrical networks, specifically using a modified topological method based on directed graph trees.
