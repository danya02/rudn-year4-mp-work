It also mentions the concept of dynamically self-organizing service networks by combining existing devices.\n\nIn this context, the scoping review is focused on wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks, and routing protocols that deal with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance. The abstract does not explicitly mention wireless mesh networks or routing protocols, but it does discuss self-organizing service networks, which could be related to the routing protocols used in wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, there is no direct relevance between the abstract's discussion of IoT devices and services and the specific topics of wireless mesh networks and routing protocols.
