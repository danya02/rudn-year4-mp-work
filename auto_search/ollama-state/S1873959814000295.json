IoT: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of sensing, communication, and computing techniques implies the involvement of IoT technologies, which is within the scope of the review.\n2. Industrial applications: Assisted living for elderly people with dementia can be seen as an industrial application, particularly in terms of developing solutions to improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations.\n3.
