However, these are more related to energy management in MANETs rather than traditional ad-hoc networks.\n\nReasoning: While the abstract is relevant to the topic of ad-hoc networks and energy management, it appears to be focused on MANETs specifically, which may not be the exact focus of the scoping review. Therefore, I would say that this abstract is partially relevant but not entirely aligned with the scope of the review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no (or partially)."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20213326190, "load_duration": 17306967, "prompt_eval_count": 313, "prompt_eval_duration": 4405000000, "eval_count": 235, "eval_duration": 15788000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:36:06.963320061Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided abstract, I can determine that it is not directly relevant to the scoping review focused on Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.
