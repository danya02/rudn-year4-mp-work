Is it related to Wireless Mesh Networks?\n2. Does it address IoT, autonomous robots, or similar industrial applications?\n3. Does it specifically deal with routing protocols in ad-hoc networks?\n\nBased on my analysis:\n\n* The abstract mentions \"Mobile Ad Hoc networks (MANET)\", which is a type of network, but not specifically Wireless Mesh Networks.\n* There is no mention of IoT, autonomous robots, or similar industrial applications.\n* The abstract does discuss routing protocols, specifically an Adaptive HELLO messaging scheme and a Dynamic On Demand Routing Protocol. However, these are more related to energy management in MANETs rather than traditional ad-hoc networks.\n\nReasoning: While the abstract is relevant to the topic of ad-hoc networks and energy management, it appears to be focused on MANETs specifically, which may not be the exact focus of the scoping review. Therefore, I would say that this abstract is partially relevant but not entirely aligned with the scope of the review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no (or partially)."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20213326190, "load_duration": 17306967, "prompt_eval_count": 313, "prompt_eval_duration": 4405000000, "eval_count": 235, "eval_duration": 15788000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:36:06.963320061Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided abstract, I can determine that it is not directly relevant to the scoping review focused on Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.

This abstract discusses Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET), which are a type of wireless network that could be considered under the umbrella of ad-hoc networks.\n\nThe Context: The context is IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications. While this abstract does not explicitly mention these contexts, it implies a mobile network scenario with limited battery power, which could relate to IoT or industrial settings where mobility and energy efficiency are critical.\n\nHowever, the inclusion criteria exclude Emergency response networks, military operations, urban infrastructure, and other types of networks using mobile phones. This abstract focuses on energy management in ad-hoc wireless networks, rather than emergency response or military contexts.\n\nThe Concept: The concept is Routing protocols, dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance. While the abstract discusses routing protocols, it specifically addresses energy optimization through an Adaptive HELLO messaging scheme and Dynamic On Demand Routing Protocol.\n\nThe Techniques for improvement: The focus of this abstract is on reducing energy consumption in ad-hoc networks using a new adaptive routing protocol, rather than techniques like multipath routing to improve throughput.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17943010397, "load_duration": 16557934, "prompt_eval_count": 313, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 265, "eval_duration": 17856000000, "verdict": false}], "verdict": false}
