The paper proposes a new opportunistic routing scheme that improves upon existing schemes by addressing security and reliability issues.\n\nThe relevance of this abstract to the scoping review can be determined based on its focus on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, particularly those with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput. While the specific technique discussed in this abstract (SMOR) is focused on opportunistic routing, it also addresses some of the concerns related to fault tolerance and security.\n\nThe paper's results show that SMOR improves upon existing routing protocols (RPL) in terms of delays, packet delivery ratios, and memory requirements, but at a slight increase in energy consumption. While this might not directly address the \"fault tolerance\" aspect of the scoping review, it does highlight the importance of considering security and reliability when designing routing protocols for wireless mesh networks.\n\nOverall, while there might be some nuances that need to be considered, the abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks in IoT applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 33850027559, "load_duration": 18108750, "prompt_eval_count": 692, "prompt_eval_duration": 15518000000, "eval_count": 263, "eval_duration": 18311000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:03:42.320638095Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "My reasoning is that the abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review for several reasons:\n\n1.

The proposed secure multipath opportunistic routing (SMOR) scheme is designed to improve upon current DSF schemes by addressing some of the limitations they have, such as lack of intrusion tolerance and single point of failure. The abstract also discusses the application of SMOR in specific scenarios, including body area networks.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract mentions the Contiki-NG operating system and its integration with SMOR, which suggests that it is a practical implementation of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the comparison between SMOR and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) using the Cooja network simulator provides quantitative evidence for the performance improvements achieved by SMOR.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract does not explicitly mention \"routing protocols\" in the context of changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, or improving throughput.
