The key reasons are:\n\n1. WMN technology: Although not explicitly stated, the use of ZigBee protocol for consumer-owned SM suggests that wireless communication is involved.\n2. SCADA system integration: While the primary focus is on energy management, the incorporation of a SCADA system with PLCs indicates an interest in networked control systems, which could be relevant to WMNs and their applications.\n3. Industrial application: The context involves modern buildings and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which suggests that the paper deals with industrial automation, a relevant application area for WMNs.\n\nHowever, there is a significant difference between this paper's focus on energy management and smart grid integration versus the scoping review's primary interest in routing protocols, fault tolerance, and throughput optimization in WMNs. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14736511171, "load_duration": 17254000, "prompt_eval_count": 352, "prompt_eval_duration": 66000000, "eval_count": 218, "eval_duration": 14651000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T02:50:56.0933088Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears relevant to the scoping review because it discusses the integration of smart meters in an IoT context, specifically for energy management in smart grid systems. The use of ZigBee protocol for consumer-owned smart meters and ModBus protocol for distributor-owned smart meters aligns with wireless mesh networks, which is a key area of focus in the scoping review.\n\nThe mention of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), SCADA system, and Programmable logic programming also suggests that the paper deals with industrial applications related to IoT and autonomous robots, which are within the scope of the review. Furthermore, the use of MATLAB software for advanced controllers and communication channels between devices implies a focus on developing efficient routing protocols and fault-tolerant systems, although these aspects are not explicitly stated in the abstract.\n\nHowever, the primary emphasis of the paper is on energy management, smart grid integration, and control strategies rather than wireless mesh networks or routing protocols specifically. Therefore, while the abstract touches on some relevant themes, its relevance to the scoping review's focus on wireless mesh networks and routing protocols may be limited.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no (though partially)."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15679158066, "load_duration": 16839102, "prompt_eval_count": 352, "prompt_eval_duration": 70000000, "eval_count": 231, "eval_duration": 15589000000, "verdict": false}], "verdict": false}
