While the concept of fault tolerance is indeed relevant to the scoping review, which focuses on routing protocols in ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks, there seems to be a broader focus on cloud computing services as a whole.\n\nThe abstract does not specifically mention wireless mesh networks or IoT applications, but rather discusses general issues related to cloud computing. Therefore, it appears that this abstract is not directly relevant to the scoping review's specific context of ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks.\n\nHowever, since the scoping review aims to provide insights into existing fault tolerance approaches, challenges, and techniques in routing protocols, even if indirectly related to cloud computing, there might be some overlap or relevance.
