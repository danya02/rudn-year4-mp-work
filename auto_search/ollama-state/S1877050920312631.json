The focus is more on simulation results than theoretical discussions of routing strategies or techniques for improving throughput.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe the abstract does touch upon aspects that are relevant to the scoping review, even if it primarily discusses mobile ad-hoc networks and opportunistic networks rather than wireless mesh networks specifically.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 26198386328, "load_duration": 16954011, "prompt_eval_count": 426, "prompt_eval_duration": 7607000000, "eval_count": 271, "eval_duration": 18572000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:36:20.492819915Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll provide my reasoning for determining relevance:\n\nThe abstract discusses Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), which are a type of network not directly relevant to the scoping review's focus on Wireless Mesh Networks.
