While the specific application context differs from the scoping review's focus on Wireless Mesh Networks and IoT, there are some relevant concepts that intersect. Team formation is a concept that also applies to other types of networks, including mesh networks, where coordination among nodes is essential for achieving goals. Additionally, the paper explores techniques for improving team formation in MANETs, which shares some similarities with the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and fault tolerance in changing network topologies.\n\nHowever, the specific characteristics of MANETs (limited computing power, limited coverage, intermittent connectivity) are not directly relevant to Wireless Mesh Networks or IoT.
