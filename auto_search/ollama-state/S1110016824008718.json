The use of Cooperative Communications is a technique that deals with changing and unknown network topology, which aligns with one of the main concepts discussed in the scoping review.\n3. The focus on optimizing resources for efficient allocation in 5G WANETs also pertains to the topic of routing protocols and improving throughput, as mentioned in the exclusion criteria.\n4.
