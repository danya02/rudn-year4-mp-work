Although the primary focus of the review might be on ad-hoc networks or industrial applications, the abstract's emphasis on IoT solutions and cross-functional integration of data aligns with some aspects of the scoping review.\n\nAnother reason is that this paper mentions a scenario where the implemented IoT solution proved to be flexible in terms of data exchange, deployment, and debugging time, which could be considered as an example of achieving improved fault tolerance in a complex system.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract does not explicitly mention routing protocols or network topology changes, which are key aspects of the scoping review.
