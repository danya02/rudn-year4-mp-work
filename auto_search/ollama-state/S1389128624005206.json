It introduces a latency jitter analysis method that assesses the viability of non-isolation scenarios, and a heuristic scheduling algorithm that significantly increases the number of scheduled flows. The framework also incorporates techniques to enhance online scheduling responsiveness and reduce scheduling runtime.

While TSN does involve routing protocols and network topology management, its primary focus lies on ultra-reliable low-latency communication, scheduling strategies, and performance metrics like latency and throughput. The abstract's emphasis on scheduling algorithms, latency jitter analysis, and workload-shifting techniques might be tangentially related to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols for changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput.\n\nHowever, the abstract's primary research contributions and methodologies are geared towards optimizing TSN's performance rather than addressing the specific challenges of ad-hoc or IoT wireless mesh networks. As a result, while there might be some overlap in certain concepts (e.g., latency, scheduling), the abstract appears to be more focused on TSN's unique requirements rather than the broader context of wireless mesh networks and IoT applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14724166378, "load_duration": 17054230, "prompt_eval_count": 419, "prompt_eval_duration": 67000000, "eval_count": 215, "eval_duration": 14637000000, "verdict": false}], "verdict": false}
