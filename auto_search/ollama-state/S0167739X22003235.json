The concept discussed in this abstract revolves around fog computing, edge computing, virtualization, and software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for creating a virtual private Ethernet network that spans edge and cloud resources.\n\nThe relevance of this abstract to the scoping review is limited because it discusses concepts more aligned with cloud computing, IoT applications that are not specifically related to wireless mesh networks or IoT, and instead focuses on fog computing and SDN techniques. The mention of \"EdgeVPN\" and \"Kubernetes with Flannel\" also seems unrelated to the specific context of Wireless Mesh Networks.\n\nHowever, some aspects of this abstract might be tangentially relevant to the scoping review if we consider the broader scope of wireless mesh networks in IoT applications, such as autonomous robots or industrial settings. The emphasis on edge computing, fog computing, and SDN techniques could indirectly inform discussions about how wireless mesh networks can support these concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is: no"}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 25358334649, "load_duration": 17409121, "prompt_eval_count": 455, "prompt_eval_duration": 8881000000, "eval_count": 237, "eval_duration": 16457000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T22:40:09.50343348Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review for several reasons:\n\n1.

The mention of NATs and firewall middleboxes could be relevant to IoT applications, but it's more about VPN setup than addressing issues like fault tolerance or topology changes.\n\nOverall, while the abstract touches on some relevant themes, its primary focus seems to be on VPN implementation rather than routing protocols or topology management specifically related to wireless mesh networks."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 13062344511, "load_duration": 17081866, "prompt_eval_count": 455, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 188, "eval_duration": 12975000000, "verdict": null}], "verdict": false}
