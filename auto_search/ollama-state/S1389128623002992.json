The authors examine the impact of the separation distance between LSs and the Optimal Hovering Position (OHP) on network performance. This research seems to be relevant to the scoping review because it deals with wireless mesh networks, particularly ad-hoc and IoT applications, which is one of the excluded categories in the original context.\n\nHowever, the abstract touches on aspects related to fault tolerance, coverage probability, and throughput, which are also relevant to the routing protocols being evaluated in the scoping review. Additionally, the discussion of energy consumption and the reduction of flying/hovering energy consumption aligns with the focus on improving throughput through techniques such as multipath routing, which is excluded from the original context.\n\nOverall, while the abstract's primary focus is not on wireless mesh networks or IoT applications, it explores themes that are relevant to the scoping review.
