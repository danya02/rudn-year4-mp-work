The proposed approach is aimed at providing a reliable end-to-end service assurance for IoT devices in constrained environments.\n\nWhile this topic may seem tangential to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols for changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput (such as multipath routing), it does touch upon aspects of network performance optimization and reliability, which are related to the broader context of wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT.\n\nMoreover, the abstract highlights the importance of QoS in MQTT-based IoT systems, which can be considered a subset of the overall goal to improve network efficiency and reliability. The evaluation of various MQTT servers and the proposed improved model's performance suggest that the study contributes to the understanding of QoS mechanisms in wireless networks, albeit within the context of MQTT specifically.\n\nIn conclusion, yes"}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20814302482, "load_duration": 17143150, "prompt_eval_count": 398, "prompt_eval_duration": 6783000000, "eval_count": 207, "eval_duration": 14011000000, "verdict": null}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:30:20.318260657Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can provide my reasoning and then conclude whether the abstract is relevant to the scoping review.\n\nReasoning:\nThe abstract discusses a proposal for an improved MQTT network with guaranteed QoS, controlled scalability, and end-to-end quality assurance. It presents a mathematical model that analyzes various network parameters such as latency, content delivery rate, and request hold time. The work evaluates the proposed model against existing systems like Apollo, RabbitMQ, and Mosquitto.\n\nSince the scoping review is focused on routing protocols for wireless mesh networks with changing and unknown topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput (which is excluded in this abstract), I would argue that the primary focus of this abstract is not directly related to the scope of the scoping review.

The abstract discusses network performance metrics (latency, content delivery rate, request hold time) that could be relevant to routing protocols.\n2. The improved MQTT model aims to provide reliable end-to-end service assurance, which might involve considerations similar to those made in wireless mesh networks (e.g., fault tolerance, scalability).\n\nDespite these connections, the abstract's primary focus on MQTT performance and QoS features makes it less directly relevant to the scoping review than a study that explicitly addresses routing protocols for wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18326513506, "load_duration": 16941379, "prompt_eval_count": 398, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 268, "eval_duration": 18239000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:30:31.211912519Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll review the abstract to determine if it's relevant to the scoping review.\n\nThe abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because:\n\n* It discusses wireless mesh networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT, which is a key focus of the scoping review.\n* The context mentioned in the abstract (IoT, autonomous robots) matches one of the excluded contexts from the scoping review.\n* However, despite being in the context of IoT, the abstract focuses on routing protocols, fault tolerance, and network performance, which are all relevant to the scoping review.\n\nReasoning: While the abstract is not a direct fit within the excluded context, it does discuss topics that are central to the scoping review (wireless mesh networks, routing protocols, etc.).\n\nIn conclusion, yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 10892213981, "load_duration": 17589224, "prompt_eval_count": 398, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 161, "eval_duration": 10804000000, "verdict": null}], "verdict": false}
