The paper evaluates the performance of NEON by implementing it with two different approaches (native and software service) for deploying complex protocols like PMIPv6 protocol, showcasing its fast configuration time.\n\nThe relevance to the scoping review is that the concept of dynamic network topology and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks, particularly ad-hoc and IoT networks, requires efficient routing protocols. Although NEON does not explicitly focus on routing protocols, its aim to enable fast device configuration and services deployment in dynamic infrastructure contexts can be seen as related to improving throughput in such networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the primary focus of the paper is on software-defined networking (SDN) and protocol deployments rather than wireless mesh networks or routing protocols per se.
