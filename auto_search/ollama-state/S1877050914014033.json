The paper evaluates the performance of NEON by implementing it with two different approaches (native and software service) for deploying complex protocols like PMIPv6 protocol, showcasing its fast configuration time.\n\nThe relevance to the scoping review is that the concept of dynamic network topology and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks, particularly ad-hoc and IoT networks, requires efficient routing protocols. Although NEON does not explicitly focus on routing protocols, its aim to enable fast device configuration and services deployment in dynamic infrastructure contexts can be seen as related to improving throughput in such networks.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the primary focus of the paper is on software-defined networking (SDN) and protocol deployments rather than wireless mesh networks or routing protocols per se. Therefore, while there may be some tangential relevance, the abstract seems more directly focused on SDN and protocol implementations than on wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 22605583378, "load_duration": 17483377, "prompt_eval_count": 387, "prompt_eval_duration": 6522000000, "eval_count": 236, "eval_duration": 16063000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T23:58:06.938189928Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review this abstract to determine its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nMy reasoning is that while this paper proposes a new protocol (NEON) for dynamic network configuration, which might seem related to routing protocols in IoT networks, the main focus of this abstract appears to be on deploying network services through Software-Defined Networking and improving reconfiguration flexibility.

However, SDN can be applied in various network settings, including those with dynamic topology and uncertain device configurations, which are relevant to the context of Wireless Mesh Networks.\n\nMoreover, the focus on rapid device configuration and services deployment, as well as the use of a southbound protocol for comprehensive network configuration, could be applicable to the needs of IoT devices in a wireless mesh network setup.
