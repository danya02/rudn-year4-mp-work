While the context is related to network topology and routing protocols, the main focus is on the properties, construction, and applications of Stirling networks, rather than routing protocols specifically. The absence of keywords such as \"routing\", \"topology changes\", or \"fault tolerance\" in the abstract suggests that it might not be directly relevant to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, some aspects of Stirling networks, like their diameter, average distance, and fault-tolerance properties, might have relevance to the context of wireless mesh networks and IoT applications.

While the abstract mentions some concepts that might be applicable in these areas (e.g., fault-tolerance), it focuses more on theoretical properties of Stirling networks and their application to multiprocessor interconnection networks.\n* Are routing protocols dealt with in the abstract?
