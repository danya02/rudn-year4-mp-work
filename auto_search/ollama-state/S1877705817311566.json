The study focuses on WiFi mesh infrastructure, which is a specific type of wireless network that can be used in IoT applications.\n2. The authors aim to improve performance and interconnection between different types of networks (ad-hoc network, WLAN, WMAN), which aligns with the context of the scoping review.\n3. The design uses QMP as an operating system, a message queuing protocol-based transport (MQTT) for IoT applications, and demonstrates good results in terms of throughput.\n4. However, it's essential to note that the paper doesn't specifically focus on routing protocols, fault tolerance, or multipath routing techniques, which were mentioned as exclusion criteria.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe abstract focuses on WiFi mesh infrastructure, IoT, and performance improvements, which are relevant aspects of the scoping review.
