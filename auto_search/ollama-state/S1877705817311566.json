The authors aim to improve performance and interconnection between different types of networks (ad-hoc network, WLAN, WMAN), which aligns with the context of the scoping review.\n3. The design uses QMP as an operating system, a message queuing protocol-based transport (MQTT) for IoT applications, and demonstrates good results in terms of throughput.\n4.
