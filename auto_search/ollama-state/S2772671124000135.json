The topic focuses on the implementation of a mesh network-based system for monitoring temporary grounding in substations and transmission lines, which falls under the broader scope of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology.\n\nHowever, it does not directly discuss routing protocols or their techniques for improving throughput like multipath routing. Instead, it emphasizes the use of mesh networks to improve safety levels by enabling real-time monitoring and quick identification of potential failures or disconnections in grounding cables.
