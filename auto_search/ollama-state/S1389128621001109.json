For example, some researchers may use SDN in IoT networks or industrial settings. Additionally, the concept of hybrid networking environments (hSDN) could potentially intersect with the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and fault tolerance in changing network topologies.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the abstract does not explicitly mention Wireless Mesh Networks or Industrial IoT.

The primary focus of the abstract is on SDN and hSDN, rather than routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n2. The context mentioned in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications) is not explicitly present in this abstract.\n3. The discussion about the adoption and implementation of SDN and hSDN does not appear to be directly related to the specific challenges and requirements of wireless mesh networks or IoT applications.\n\nHowever, it's possible that some aspects of SDN and hSDN might be relevant to the scoping review, such as:\n\n1. Fault tolerance: Hybrid SDN might offer some benefits in terms of fault tolerance, which could be relevant to wireless mesh networks.\n2. Routing protocols: While not explicitly mentioned, SDN and hSDN might involve advanced routing protocols that could be relevant to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential connections between this abstract and the scoping review, it seems like the primary focus of the abstract is on SDN and hSDN rather than wireless mesh networks specifically.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20706665009, "load_duration": 17108237, "prompt_eval_count": 326, "prompt_eval_duration": 66000000, "eval_count": 306, "eval_duration": 20621000000, "verdict": false}], "verdict": false}
