The Population: Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks are specified. However, the focus is on Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSN), which falls under this category.\n2. Context: The context is industrial applications, specifically IIoT and smart factories. This aligns with the exclusion criteria mentioned in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots, etc.), but IWSN does not use mobile phones or traditional networks, so it might be considered relevant.\n3. Concept: Routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance are explicitly excluded from the scope. However, since IWSN is a specific type of IoT network that likely employs routing protocols to maintain connectivity, this exclusion might still apply.\n4. Techniques for improving throughput (multipath routing) are also excluded.\n\nAfter considering these points, I would conclude that \"In conclusion, the answer is no\".
