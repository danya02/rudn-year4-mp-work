The context is IoT, which aligns with the excluded context in the scoping review (emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure). However, the specific application of IoT sensors in monitoring air quality and mobility in an urban setting might still be relevant.\n2. The concept of routing protocols is not explicitly mentioned in this abstract, but the discussion on monitoring flow and concentration of particulate matters could potentially involve techniques related to data processing and analysis, which might indirectly relate to routing protocols.\n3.
