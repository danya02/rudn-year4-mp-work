The use of RISs in WMNs could potentially improve their performance, particularly in terms of routing protocols dealing with changing network topology.\n2. **Routing Protocols**: Although not directly mentioned, optimizing channel properties (e.g., throughput) in WMNs might benefit from the innovative approaches presented in this paper. Improving optical transparency and reflection amplitude within a certain band could lead to more efficient data transmission in WMNs.\n3. **Fault Tolerance and Ad-hoc Networks**: The use of RISs can potentially help improve fault tolerance in WMNs, as they can dynamically adjust their properties in response to changing network conditions.\n\nHowever, I would argue that the abstract's focus on:\n\n* Optical transparency and reflection amplitude\n* Metalmesh-based designs\n* Wavefront controls\n\nis not directly related to the primary topics of WMNs (routing protocols, fault tolerance, and throughput optimization).\n\nGiven these considerations, I conclude that **the answer is no**, this abstract is not directly relevant to the scoping review on Wireless Mesh Networks."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18562646389, "load_duration": 19475620, "prompt_eval_count": 391, "prompt_eval_duration": 70000000, "eval_count": 272, "eval_duration": 18470000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2025-04-16T23:00:42.78886118Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThis abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review for several reasons:\n\n1.
