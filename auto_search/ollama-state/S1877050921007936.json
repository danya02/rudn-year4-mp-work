The context mentioned in the abstract (Smart grid applications) is not directly related to the IoT, autonomous robots, or industrial applications excluded from the scoping review.\n2. While wireless sensor networks are used in the smart grid application, the focus on network availability and collision avoidance with dynamic nodes does not align with the specific routing protocols and fault tolerance aspects emphasized in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, there is a brief mention of using a multicast probabilistic model to avoid congestion and dark spots in Wireless Sensor Networks.
