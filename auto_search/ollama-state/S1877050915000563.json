While the topic is not directly related to Wireless Mesh Networks or routing protocols, it is indirectly relevant in that it deals with wireless networks (the front-end of a FiWi network) and aims to optimize their deployment.\n\nFurthermore, the abstract touches on issues of network topology and optimization, which are also relevant to the scoping review. Specifically, the work addresses how to minimize the number of ONUs while ensuring connectivity among wireless routers, which is similar to the concept of fault tolerance in routing protocols for Wireless Mesh Networks.\n\nHowever, the primary focus of this work is on optimizing ONU placement in FiWi networks rather than addressing specific routing protocol issues or network topology changes.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 12349908056, "load_duration": 17776599, "prompt_eval_count": 268, "prompt_eval_duration": 64000000, "eval_count": 184, "eval_duration": 12266000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:38:52.736673157Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review this abstract and provide my reasoning.\n\nThis abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it:\n\n1.
