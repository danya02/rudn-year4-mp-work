The population scope: The abstract focuses on \"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\" specifically in 3D scenarios, which aligns with one of the excluded populations (Industrial applications and IoT) mentioned in the initial statement.\n2. Context: While the abstract mentions industrial applications, it's more focused on wireless sensor networks and beamforming techniques rather than emergency response networks or military operations.\n3.
