While it primarily focuses on a provisioning framework rather than wireless mesh networks themselves, it touches on some of the challenges and technologies (e.g., fault tolerance) that are also relevant to the broader scope of the review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **yes**, with a note that this abstract contributes to the scoping review by highlighting the importance of provisioning frameworks in IoT deployments, which may intersect with wireless mesh networks."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 26642787018, "load_duration": 20320731, "prompt_eval_count": 459, "prompt_eval_duration": 75000000, "eval_count": 342, "eval_duration": 26544000000, "verdict": true}], "verdict": true}
