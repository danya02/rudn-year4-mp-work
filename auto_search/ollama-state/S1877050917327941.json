For example, the abstract focuses on mobile ad-hoc networks and QoS, whereas the scoping review specifically targets wireless mesh networks, particularly ad-hoc and IoT applications.\n\nOverall, while the abstract is not directly relevant to the scoping review, it does touch on some related concepts and techniques that may be applicable or useful in the context of wireless mesh networks and IoT applications. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 23228661032, "load_duration": 16597801, "prompt_eval_count": 364, "prompt_eval_duration": 6243000000, "eval_count": 246, "eval_duration": 16967000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:43:45.502092601Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\nThe abstract discusses mobile ad-hoc networks, which falls outside the scope of the scoping review focusing on wireless mesh networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT applications.
