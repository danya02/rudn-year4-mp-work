The abstract is discussing Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), which aligns with the population mentioned in the scoping review.\n2. Although the context is not explicitly IoT or autonomous robots, the focus on improving QoS and reliability for video streaming applications could be relevant to industrial applications like autonomous robots.\n3. However, the specific techniques proposed, such as Multiple Description Coding (MDC), load balancing, and routing protocols, might not directly address fault tolerance or changing network topology.\n4.
