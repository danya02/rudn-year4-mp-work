The Concept: Routing protocols are not directly addressed in the abstract, as it focuses on power and rate adaptation techniques rather than routing protocols per se.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that this abstract is relevant to the scoping review because it deals with ad-hoc networks, which are within the scope of interest, and touches upon performance optimization topics (energy conservation, data rate) that could be relevant to IoT and industrial applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17309662055, "load_duration": 16756607, "prompt_eval_count": 354, "prompt_eval_duration": 5559000000, "eval_count": 175, "eval_duration": 11730000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:29:20.545367402Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review the abstract to determine its relevance to the scoping review.\n\nThe abstract discusses a specific research paper proposing a joint power and rate adaptation algorithm for ad-hoc networks, called Coupled Interference Minimization (PRIM).
