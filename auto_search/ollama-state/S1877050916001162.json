The context is IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications, excluding emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure.\n\nThe abstract under discussion discusses the performance of optical wireless systems in the presence of atmospheric effects on short-distance multipath communication links. While there is some overlap between the concepts of wireless mesh networks and optical wireless systems (both operate on multiple paths to achieve reliable communication), the primary focus of this paper is on optimizing optical path selection for communication links affected by atmospheric conditions, rather than addressing routing protocols or network topology.\n\nThe abstract does not explicitly mention routing protocols, multipath routing, or fault tolerance, which are key aspects of the scoping review. However, it does discuss optimal path selection criteria and performance degradation patterns, which might be tangentially related to routing protocols in a broader context.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no.
