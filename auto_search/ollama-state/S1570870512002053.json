Wireless Sensor Networks: This is a specific type of network mentioned in the scope of the scoping review.\n2. Link Quality Estimation: This topic falls under routing protocols, fault tolerance, and improving throughput, which are all concepts discussed in the scoping review.\n3. Kalman Filter: While not directly related to the specific routing protocols discussed in the scoping review, Kalman filters can be used for state estimation and filtering, which could have implications for wireless networks.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects that make this abstract less relevant:\n\n1. Specificity of the IEEE 802.15.4 system: The solution proposed is tailored to this specific system, which might limit its applicability to other types of wireless networks.\n2.
