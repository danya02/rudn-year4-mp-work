While the primary focus is on optical networks with WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) mesh networks, the concepts of grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment are relevant to wireless mesh networks. Specifically, the use of light-trees in multicast traffic grooming can be seen as analogous to techniques used in wireless networks for improving network efficiency, such as multipath routing or optimized routing protocols.\n\nThe abstract's emphasis on minimizing grooming cost and wavelength requirement also aligns with the objectives of improving throughput and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.
