The context appears to be related to improving Quality of Service (QoS), which aligns with one of the areas of focus in the scoping review (dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel method for clustering nodes, load sharing amongst clusters, and integrating WMN with wired networks, all of which seem relevant to addressing issues related to routing protocols, bandwidth demand, and QoS.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the main focus of the abstract is on improving QoS in wireless mesh networks by proposing a novel approach for clustering and load sharing. The mention of integrating WMN with wired networks seems more like an ancillary aspect rather than the primary contribution of the paper.
