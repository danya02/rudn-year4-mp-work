While PIoT may be related to some aspects of IoT, the scope of the scoping review specifically excludes other kinds of networks, such as those using mobile phones.\n- The context mentioned in the abstract is real-time monitoring, wireless coverage, remote sensing, delivery, security, surveillance, and civil infrastructure inspection.
