Although it mentions specific types of networks (hypercubes and multi-dimensional meshes), which might seem relevant due to their mesh-like topologies, the context is focused on \"parallel computers\" and the problem at hand is \"list-ranking.\" This is different from the scope of the scoping review, which focuses on Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks.\n\nHowever, there are some indirect connections between the abstract's topic (interconnection networks for parallel computing) and the scoping review's focus area (Wireless Mesh Networks).
