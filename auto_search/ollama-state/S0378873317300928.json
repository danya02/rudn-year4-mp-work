The focus on networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks, is mentioned in the context of analyzing coordination dynamics within adoption. While not explicitly mentioning wireless mesh networks, this topic seems related to the broader scope of the review.\n2. The emphasis on routing protocols and network topology changes is absent, but the discussion on network structure and its impact on coordination might be tangentially relevant to the scoping review's focus on fault tolerance in ad-hoc networks.\n3. The exploration of social influence and critical values for coordination emergence could be seen as loosely connected to the concepts of routing protocols and fault tolerance discussed in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the abstract is more focused on analyzing contagion dynamics in communication networks rather than directly addressing wireless mesh networks or routing protocols.
