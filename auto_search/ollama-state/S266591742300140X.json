Although it doesn't explicitly mention WMNs or routing protocols for unknown network topology, it discusses various techniques that can be applied to improve performance, reduce latency, and increase throughput in wireless communication systems, which is a key area of focus for WMNs.\n\nThe abstract mentions reconfigurable routing methods, congestion management (using a Marching memory arbitrator), and secure communication techniques (such as frequency division multiplexing). These topics are relevant to the scoping review, which aims to identify existing research on routing protocols, fault tolerance, and performance optimization in WMNs.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract appears to focus more on \"networks-on-chip\" and high-performance computing applications rather than traditional wireless mesh networks.
