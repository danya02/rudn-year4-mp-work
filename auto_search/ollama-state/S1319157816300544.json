Additionally, energy efficiency and node deployment strategies might relate to the techniques excluded (multipath routing) but could be seen as a secondary aspect of network design.\n\nHowever, the specific exclusion criteria about emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure are less relevant to this paper's focus on monitoring areas using sensor nodes for events.
