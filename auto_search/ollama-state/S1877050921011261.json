Although it doesn't directly discuss routing protocols or network topology changes, it does mention deploying a prototype network with multiple nodes for field testing, which implies the need to handle dynamic network topology changes. Additionally, it touches on the concept of fault tolerance due to the ability of LoRa network nodes to be deployed for an extended period without recharging.\n\nThe abstract also discusses improving throughput and efficiency in the network by optimizing sensing capabilities and communication protocols (e.g., LoRa). However, it does not explicitly focus on routing protocols or multipath routing techniques.\n\nOverall, while the abstract may not directly address the specific concepts within the scoping review (routing protocols, changing/unknown network topology, fault tolerance, etc.), it touches on some related aspects that might be relevant to the broader context of wireless mesh networks and IoT applications."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 18963131334, "load_duration": 17098612, "prompt_eval_count": 342, "prompt_eval_duration": 5193000000, "eval_count": 205, "eval_duration": 13750000000, "verdict": null}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T00:45:16.570927811Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review the abstract step by step:\n\n1.
