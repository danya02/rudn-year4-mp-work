This could potentially be relevant to the scoping review as there is some overlap between industrial applications of IoT and autonomous robots with wireless communication systems.\n* Additionally, while the specific technique of microwave wireless power transmission might not directly relate to routing protocols or network topology changes, the development of analytical methods for complex electromagnetic problems is an area that intersects with networking and computer science.\n\nGiven these points, I would argue that the abstract does have some relevance to the scoping review, but only tangentially. The paper's focus on microwave wireless power transmission does not directly address the key concepts of routing protocols or network topology changes in ad-hoc and IoT networks.
