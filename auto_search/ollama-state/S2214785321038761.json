The Population: The review focuses on Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT networks. This study, however, discusses Network-on-Chip (NOC) architectures for heterogeneous cores in chip technology, which is outside the scope of wireless mesh networks.\n2. The Context: The review excludes applications like emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure. While the proposed NOC architecture could be applicable to various industrial and IoT applications, the specific context mentioned in this study (e.g., autonomous robots) might not align with the exclusion criteria.\n\nHowever, despite the mismatch in Population and Context, the Concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology is relevant to the scoping review. The study proposes a novel router design using an XY routing algorithm that addresses issues like sequential port allocation and long critical paths, which are similar to concerns discussed in the context of wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 14244020331, "load_duration": 16628844, "prompt_eval_count": 385, "prompt_eval_duration": 72000000, "eval_count": 209, "eval_duration": 14152000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T20:57:32.983625105Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's my reasoning for determining relevance:\n\nThe abstract discusses a novel NOC architecture with a focus on improving performance, reducing area consumption, and decreasing power consumption.
