It mentions that these solutions are needed for large-scale deployments with limited infrastructure, long-term operation without human intervention, and energy efficiency. The focus on 6LoWPAN sensors using CoAP suggests a specific interest in wireless mesh networks or similar technologies.\n\nThe context of the abstract does not mention routing protocols, fault tolerance, changing network topology, or throughput improvements explicitly mentioned in the scoping review. However, it does touch on the challenges of deploying IoT applications with limited resources and infrastructure, which could be related to the challenges of maintaining reliable communication in wireless mesh networks.\n\nGiven that the main focus of the abstract is on environmental monitoring using IoT and Edge/Cloud Computing, but without explicit mention of routing protocols or fault tolerance, I would consider it partially relevant to the scoping review.
