The article discusses the limitations of existing metrics, such as ETX, and presents an improved metric, xDDR, that addresses some of these issues. This aligns with the context of the scoping review, which excludes emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure, but is focused on industrial applications like IoT and autonomous robots.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions experiments conducted in both static and mobile scenarios, which could be relevant to the challenges faced by wireless mesh networks in various environments.
