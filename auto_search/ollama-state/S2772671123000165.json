The main focus of this study is on the application of communication technologies in digitalizing power systems, which can include wireless networks for advanced metering infrastructure. While the specific context of smart grids and communication technologies may not align with the original scope of ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks, the abstract discusses relevant concepts such as:\n\n* Communication technologies (wireless and wired)\n* Multi-criteria methods for selecting communication technologies\n* Performance metrics (spectrum, data rate, coverage range) that are also relevant to routing protocols in wireless mesh networks.\n\nThe study's findings on WiMAX being the most preferred technology followed by Zigbee can be seen as tangentially related to the development of efficient routing protocols in ad-hoc and IoT networks.
