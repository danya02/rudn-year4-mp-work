The proposed scheme utilizes network coding to efficiently share large files among peers in the P2P overlay. While the main focus is on P2P networks, there is an indirect connection to MANETs through the use of P2P applications on MANETs.\n\nThe concept of routing protocols, fault tolerance, and topology changes is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.
