The article describes a new strategy that minimizes scan periods and reduces overall energy consumption by introducing an asynchronous polling process. This seems to align with the context of routing protocols in mesh networks dealing with changing and unknown network topology, which is also within the scope of the review.\n\nThe abstract does not explicitly mention routing protocols or fault tolerance, but the proposed solution addresses a key challenge (energy efficiency) that is likely relevant to these areas. Additionally, the application scenarios mentioned (BLE sensor networks) are similar to those excluded in the review (IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications).
