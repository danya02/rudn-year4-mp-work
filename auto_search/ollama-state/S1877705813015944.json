The context specified in the scoping review excludes networks using mobile phones, but it does include ad-hoc and IoT wireless mesh networks. Since MANETs are a type of ad-hoc network, this abstract appears to be relevant.\n2. The topic of scheduling algorithms for improving performance in real-time applications is directly related to the concept of routing protocols dealing with changing and unknown network topology, which is also excluded. However, since the focus is on real-time traffic prioritization within MANETs, it can be considered a complementary area of research that may indirectly contribute to understanding routing protocols.\n3.
