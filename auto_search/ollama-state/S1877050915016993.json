Its publish/subscribe model could also be relevant to some routing protocols in WMNs.\n3. **Experimental comparison with socket IO**: The paper compares DDS with another method (socket IO) for RTC, which implies an investigation into performance metrics such as throughput satisfaction rate, round trip time, and packet loss. These metrics are also relevant to the routing protocols being studied within the context of WMNs.\n\nReasoning:\n\nWhile the abstract focuses on the application of DDS in real-time communication, it is not directly about WMNs or routing protocols. However, the focus on RTC, QoS features, and performance metrics makes it tangentially related to the scoping review's focus areas (routing protocols for changing network topologies and fault tolerance). Furthermore, the comparison with another technology (socket IO) suggests an interest in evaluating the performance of DDS, which might be relevant to WMNs.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **yes**.
