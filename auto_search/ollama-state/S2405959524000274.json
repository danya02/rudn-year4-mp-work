While the abstract does not explicitly mention Wireless Mesh Networks, it discusses security aspects that could be relevant to such networks, especially in terms of fault tolerance and access control, which are areas of focus for Wireless Mesh Network research.\n3.

Although the context mentioned in the original scoping review excludes emergency response networks, military operations, and urban infrastructure, some industrial applications like IoT are included. The abstract's discussion on LPWAN security and its focus areas also align with the concept of routing protocols and fault tolerance, although it doesn't explicitly address these topics.\n\nHowever, the review of specific attacks, threat modeling, and proposed countermeasures in Sigfox, LoRaWAN, and Narrowband Internet of Things seems more focused on security than routing protocols.
