Although the context mentioned in the review excludes certain types of networks (e.g., mobile phones) and applications (e.g., emergency response), the discussion of dynamic RWA (Route Weight Allocation) algorithms, QoS (Quality of Service), link protection mechanisms, and wavelength continuity is closely related to the routing protocols being evaluated in the scoping review.\n\nThe focus on improving network performance, reducing service blocking rates, and ensuring quality of service guarantees aligns with the objectives of the scoping review.
