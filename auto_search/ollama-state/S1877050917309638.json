The focus on identifying abnormal links in network topology, particularly when dealing with large-scale networks, aligns with the exclusion criteria mentioned for military operations and urban infrastructure. Additionally, the use of compressed sensing-based network tomography to identify abnormal links and the proposed route selection algorithms for efficient measurement routing are relevant topics related to routing protocols, fault tolerance, and improving throughput.\n\nThe abstract specifically discusses techniques for identifying abnormal links in a network when something goes wrong, which is closely related to the scoping review's focus on emergency response networks.
