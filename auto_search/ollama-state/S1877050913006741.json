The proposed algorithm addresses issues related to fault tolerance, routing protocols, and throughput, which are all relevant topics within the scope of this scoping review.\n\nHowever, the main focus of the paper seems to be on improving the quality of service (QoS) for high-priority traffic through a novel SLA-aware mechanism, rather than directly addressing issues such as changing and unknown network topology or routing protocols.
