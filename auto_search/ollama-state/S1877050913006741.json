The focus is on optimizing traffic engineering, path constraints, and service level agreements (SLAs) in optical shared mesh networks, which can be seen as a related area to fault tolerance and throughput improvement techniques in wireless mesh networks.\n\nAlthough the paper specifically focuses on optical shared mesh networks and does not directly mention routing protocols for ad-hoc or IoT wireless mesh networks, the concepts of traffic engineering, path constraints, and SLA-aware mechanisms are relevant to the scoping review. The use of a novel mechanism to optimize high-priority connection requests with long holding times also aligns with the focus on fault tolerance and improving throughput in wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17493140901, "load_duration": 16723166, "prompt_eval_count": 341, "prompt_eval_duration": 5193000000, "eval_count": 183, "eval_duration": 12280000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:52:37.243714826Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will review the abstract to determine if it is relevant to the scoping review.\n\nThe provided abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because:\n\n* The context mentioned in the abstract (IoT, autonomous robots, and industrial applications) aligns with the excluded context specified in the scoping review.\n* The specific type of network mentioned (optical shared mesh networks) is not explicitly excluded in the scoping review, although it could be argued that ad-hoc wireless mesh networks are a more relevant comparison.\n* The abstract's focus on routing protocols, fault tolerance, and techniques for improving throughput (although \"multipath routing\" is specifically excluded, the proposed mechanism does seem to address related issues) makes it tangentially relevant to the scoping review.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I believe that the abstract is not entirely relevant because:\n\n* The paper's focus on optical shared mesh networks, which are a specific type of network that may not be directly comparable to ad-hoc wireless mesh networks.\n* The main contribution of the paper appears to be related to service level agreement (SLA) negotiation and traffic engineering, which might not be directly applicable to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols and fault tolerance in the context of IoT and autonomous robots.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17876593419, "load_duration": 16495303, "prompt_eval_count": 341, "prompt_eval_duration": 65000000, "eval_count": 263, "eval_duration": 17793000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T21:52:45.651926704Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears relevant to the scoping review as it discusses a specific routing protocol or technique (SLA-aware mechanism) used in wireless mesh networks (optical shared mesh networks), which is related to improving fault tolerance, throughput, and resource utilization in IoT and industrial applications.\n\nThe focus on adaptive provisioning algorithm, traffic engineering path constraints, and dynamic service level agreement negotiation suggests that the paper is relevant to the concepts discussed in the scoping review.
