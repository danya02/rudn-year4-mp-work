The context is different: The scoping review focuses on wireless mesh networks, specifically ad-hoc and IoT networks, whereas the abstract discusses public transport networks in polycentric regions.\n2. Routing protocols are excluded: While network topology and design variables are discussed, the study appears to focus more on the emergent properties of multi-modal public transport networks rather than routing protocols or techniques for improving throughput.\n3.
