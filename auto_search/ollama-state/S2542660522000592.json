Although the focus of the abstract is not explicitly on routing protocols, it highlights a broader concern (security) that can indirectly relate to the stability and reliability of network connections, particularly in fault-tolerant and dynamic environments such as those found in ad-hoc and mesh networks.\n\nThe integration of emerging technologies like machine learning and blockchain into IoT networks could have implications for the performance and security of these networks, including their routing protocols. For instance, if machine learning algorithms are used to optimize network routing in real-time, this could introduce new fault-tolerant mechanisms or improve existing ones.\n\nHowever, the abstract's primary focus is on IoT security threats and solutions rather than on routing protocols specifically.
