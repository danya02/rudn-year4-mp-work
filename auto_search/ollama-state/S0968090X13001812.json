The context mentioned in the original request excludes applications like emergency response networks, military operations, or urban infrastructure, where traffic congestion might be relevant.\n\nHowever, there are some potential connections between the abstract's focus on traffic congestion analysis and the concept of fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks. Fault-tolerant routing protocols can help mitigate issues with network connectivity due to congestion or other disruptions. Therefore, it is possible that the techniques proposed in this paper could have implications for improving resilience and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.\n\nAdditionally, as IoT devices are increasingly used in various industries, including transportation, the visualization of traffic congestion patterns may eventually benefit from techniques like multipath routing, which was excluded from the original scoping review.
