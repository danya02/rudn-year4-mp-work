Although WSAN specifically mentions IEEE 802.11 standard, this is not directly related to wireless mesh networks or ad-hoc networks. However, the discussion of delay-reliability trade-off might be relevant in the broader scope of routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, especially those dealing with changing and unknown network topology.\n\nThe focus on packet reliability and delay is also somewhat related to the topic of fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks, which deals with ensuring reliable communication even when some nodes or links fail. However, the specific use of MIMO-Enabled IEEE 802.11 standard, EDCA, and Maximum Likelihood Spatial Multiplexing might not be directly applicable to ad-hoc networks.\n\nConsidering these points, while the abstract touches on some relevant themes in wireless networking, its primary focus is more related to WSANs and IEEE 802.11 standards rather than wireless mesh networks or ad-hoc networks specifically.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 19216166255, "load_duration": 17020241, "prompt_eval_count": 301, "prompt_eval_duration": 4078000000, "eval_count": 226, "eval_duration": 15118000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T01:54:40.3631321Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review because it:\n\n* Focuses on Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), which falls under the scope of \"Wireless Mesh Networks, especially ad-hoc and IoT\".\n* Discusses a specific application context (factory environment) that aligns with the excluded contexts mentioned in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots and similar industrial applications).\n* Explores routing protocols related to changing network topology and fault tolerance, which are relevant to the scoping review's focus on routing protocols.\n* Examines techniques for improving throughput (specifically packet delay) under noisy conditions, which is within the scope of the scoping review.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the abstract doesn't explicitly mention \"routing protocols\" or discuss how they address issues related to changing network topology or fault tolerance.
