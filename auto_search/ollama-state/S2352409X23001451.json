The context of the abstract is the Late Bronze Age in Europe, which falls within the time frame of interest for the scoping review.\n2. Although the study focuses on the Lusatian Urnfield culture and its metal artefacts, it discusses the trade networks and exchange routes that connected this culture to other regions in Europe during the Late Bronze Age.
