The abstract does not explicitly mention Wireless Mesh Networks, ad-hoc networks, or IoT.\n2. However, it does discuss optical networks and their performance, which could be tangentially related to wireless mesh networks since both types of networks may involve communication protocols that impact QoS.\n3. The focus on Quality of Service (QoS) schemes in the abstract could indirectly relate to routing protocols for wireless mesh networks, especially if the study discusses techniques that improve throughput or deal with changing network topology.\n\nDespite these indirect connections, the primary theme of the abstract appears to be focused on optical networks and QoS schemes rather than wireless mesh networks. The lack of direct relevance suggests that while there might be some overlap in concepts (e.g., QoS), the specific context and focus of this study do not align closely with the scoping review.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 17816139613, "load_duration": 17169206, "prompt_eval_count": 332, "prompt_eval_duration": 5015000000, "eval_count": 191, "eval_duration": 12781000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-12T23:49:27.923153844Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reasoning:\n\nThe abstract discusses Quality of Service (QoS) schemes used in optical networks, which is relevant to the scoping review's context of Industrial IoT and autonomous robots.
