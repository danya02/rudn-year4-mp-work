While this topic may seem unrelated to wireless mesh networks at first glance, there is a potential connection: the abstract mentions \"real-time\" home monitoring, which could be facilitated by wireless mesh networks or similar technologies. Additionally, IoT (Internet of Things) concepts are mentioned, as the system aims to monitor and respond to changes in daily activities. While the focus on autonomous robots and industrial applications is excluded from the scoping review, the abstract's emphasis on IoT and home monitoring may still be relevant.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the primary focus of the abstract is on developing a home monitoring system for elderly care, rather than exploring wireless mesh networks or routing protocols specifically.
