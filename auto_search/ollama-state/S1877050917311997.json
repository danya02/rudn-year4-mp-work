Additionally, the paper discusses routing protocols for dealing with changing and unknown network topology, fault tolerance, and improving throughput, specifically in the context of dense 802.11n networks.

The context of the paper (802.11n networks) seems unrelated to the context specified in the scoping review (IoT, autonomous robots, and similar industrial applications).\n2. While the topic of channel adaptation algorithms might be tangentially related to routing protocols, it doesn't directly address issues like fault tolerance, changing network topology, or multipath routing.\n3. The focus on rate and channel adaptation schemes for mitigating interference in 802.11n networks is also not explicitly mentioned as relevant in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, if we consider the broader context of wireless networking and communication protocols, the concepts of channel adaptation algorithms, signal strength measurement (RSSI), and channel information (CSI) might be seen as indirectly related to routing protocols in general.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no.
