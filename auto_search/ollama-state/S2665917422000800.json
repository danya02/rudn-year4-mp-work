However, the abstract also discusses Edge Computing, which might be seen as a secondary or tangential topic within the context.\n\n3. **Relevance of Concept**: The concept is Routing protocols and fault tolerance, but it's not explicitly stated that routing protocols are being discussed in relation to wireless mesh networks or IoT applications. Instead, it seems more focused on task scheduling and optimization.\n\n4. **Exclusion criteria**: The scoping review excludes emergency response networks, military operations, urban infrastructure, and techniques for improving throughput (e.g., multipath routing). While Edge Computing might be tangentially related to some of these areas, the abstract's focus is not explicitly excluded by any of these criteria.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would conclude that the abstract is **not directly relevant** to the scoping review.
