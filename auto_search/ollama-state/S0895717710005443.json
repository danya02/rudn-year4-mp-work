Additionally, the abstract discusses data exchange between devices and the visualization of field information, which could be related to routing protocols and fault tolerance in WMNs.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that the abstract is somewhat relevant to the scoping review, but with some caveats. It may not directly address the specific aspects of WMN concepts or routing protocols discussed in the review, but it does involve WSN technology, which is a broader category that includes wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is yes, with the caveat that the relevance is indirect and limited to the scope of WSNs."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 22169938267, "load_duration": 16589640, "prompt_eval_count": 336, "prompt_eval_duration": 5092000000, "eval_count": 254, "eval_duration": 17059000000, "verdict": true}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2024-12-13T03:15:41.625917099Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The abstract is relevant to the scoping review because it describes a wireless mesh network (WSN) system, specifically using Zigbee technology, which falls under the scope of Wireless Mesh Networks mentioned in the introduction.

The abstract mentions a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) as part of the system, which is included in the Population of interest.\n2. The context is IoT-related, specifically focusing on farming applications, which falls within the excluded contexts mentioned in the scoping review (e.g., urban infrastructure).\n3. The topic does not explicitly address routing protocols, fault tolerance, or improving throughput, which are the main concepts being explored in the scoping review.\n\nHowever, there might be some indirect relevance if we consider that:\n\n1. Zigbee technology is used in the WSN, and while it's a specific type of wireless communication, the abstract doesn't delve into routing protocols or fault tolerance.\n2. The use of GPS and GIS technologies might imply some basic understanding of network topology, but again, this isn't directly related to the scoping review's focus.\n\nGiven these points, I believe the abstract is not highly relevant to the scoping review due to its focus on IoT applications in a specific context (farming) rather than the general topics of routing protocols and fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is no."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 16837939558, "load_duration": 17014821, "prompt_eval_count": 336, "prompt_eval_duration": 68000000, "eval_count": 249, "eval_duration": 16750000000, "verdict": false}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2025-04-16T22:59:17.869499237Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "This abstract appears to be relevant to the scoping review on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) in IoT applications.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The abstract describes a system using Zigbee technology, which is commonly used in WMNs.\n* It mentions the use of WSNs as part of the overall system, indicating an interest in wireless network technologies that are often associated with WMNs.\n* While the focus is on a smart mobile farming service system, the use of WMN-like technologies (WSNs, Zigbee coordinator) makes it relevant to the scoping review's scope.\n\nIn conclusion, yes."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 15265726724, "load_duration": 20343843, "prompt_eval_count": 336, "prompt_eval_duration": 6299000000, "eval_count": 121, "eval_duration": 8944000000, "verdict": null}, {"model": "llama3.2", "created_at": "2025-04-16T22:59:39.483671528Z", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine if this abstract is relevant to the scoping review on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), especially ad-hoc and IoT, I analyzed the following factors:\n\n1.
