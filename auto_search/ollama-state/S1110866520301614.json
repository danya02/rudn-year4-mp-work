The context of the abstract, UP2PVANET (urban Peer-to-Peer VANET environment), matches the excluded context specified in the scoping review (industrial applications such as IoT and autonomous robots).\n2. While the abstract does mention routing protocols, specifically AODV, it excludes techniques like multipath routing, which is mentioned in the scoping review.\n3. The focus of the abstract is on improving security and confidentiality in a VANET environment, rather than on routing protocols or improving throughput.\n\nHowever, there are some potential connections between this abstract and the scoping review:\n\n1. The use of homomorphic encryption to detect routing attacks may be relevant to fault tolerance in wireless mesh networks.\n2. Improving security and confidentiality in a VANET environment could indirectly benefit from techniques used in wireless mesh networks, such as improving throughput or fault tolerance.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential connections between the abstract and the scoping review, the main focus of the abstract appears to be on security and confidentiality in a specific context that is excluded from the review.
