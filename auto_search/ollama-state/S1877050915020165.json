The topic also touches on routing protocols, specifically multipath routing protocol, which aligns with one of the excluded concepts in the scoping review (techniques for improving throughput). However, the main focus of the abstract seems to be on a new file sharing scheme rather than traditional routing protocols, making it slightly off-topic.
