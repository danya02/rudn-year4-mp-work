However, upon closer inspection, I notice that one of the meshes mentioned (square meshes) can be used as a model for representing and analyzing wireless mesh network topologies.\n\nIn particular, the abstract mentions that square meshes can be incidence colored with \u0394 + 1 colors, which may have implications for understanding how routing protocols perform in wireless mesh networks.
